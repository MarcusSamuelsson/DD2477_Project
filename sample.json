        "text": "Mike Goldberg spent his early career working in financial services, putting in long hours for 12 years, he said, before he decided it was time to call it quits.\u201cI was just chasing money,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I realized that is not me. \u2026 It just wasn\u2019t true to my core.\u201dIn 1996, Goldberg left his job and his home in Los Angeles to follow his passion for underwater diving, spending time in Hawaii, the British Virgin Islands, and the Cayman Islands.\u201cWhen I got out of the water after my very first dive, I decided that this is what I really wanted to do \u2026 to take my life and somehow intertwine diving and making a living,\u201d he said.In 2004, Goldberg and his family settled in Islamorada, in the Florida Keys, and opened a dive shop, Key Dives.Today, he\u2019s on a mission to help bring the area\u2019s coral reefs back to life through his nonprofit,.As an avid diver, Goldberg developed a strong appreciation for the coral reefs and their essential role in the marine ecosystem. They not only support all kinds of species, but they protect coastal areas, and millions of people depend on them for food and jobs.Over the last two decades, he saw coral reefs in the Florida Keys go from colorful and full of life to functionally extinct today. What he used to see were \u201cbrain coral the size of a VW Beetle, and fields of staghorn and elkhorn coral that went on forever,\u201d he said.Now, he says many of the reefs in the area cannot recover naturally on their own and require human intervention to survive. Goldberg knew he needed to do something to help and wanted to find a way to get other people involved.\u201cI know more about the history of and what\u2019s happening now to the reef than most people,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not a scientist, but that puts me in a unique position to communicate in layman\u2019s terms about what\u2019s going on.\u201dHe realized that recreational divers could be a great workforce to help turn around the damage and restore the reefs. He also envisioned that other local dive shops, residents, and tourists could play a role.Around the same time, he met Dr. Kylie Smith, who was completing her PhD to become a behavioral ecologist and a coral reef ecologist. They spent hours at Goldberg\u2019s dive shop discussing the health of the reef.In 2019, they teamed up to co-found, which stands for Islamorada Conservation and Restoration Education, with the goal of empowering divers to help restore the area\u2019s reefs, ensuring their survival for future generations.I.CARE organizes and offers special coral restoration dives for local and out-of-town participants. They spend the day learning about the importance of coral reefs and how to help rebuild them, then they go on dives to transplant coral grown in a local nursery run by Mote Marine Laboratory and Aquarium.So far, Goldberg says the organization has transplanted more than 10,000 corals and educated more than 2,000 people. The I.CARE team monitors and maintains all of the transplanted coral, making sure it\u2019s thriving.\u201cThere\u2019s so much work to do. We\u2019re just getting started,\u201d Goldberg said.CNN\u2019s Laura Klairmont spoke with Goldberg about his efforts. Below is an edited version of their conversation.What has caused the degradation of the coral reefs in the Florida Keys?The Keys in general \u2013 the ocean, the coral reef, the marine life \u2013 used to be the best anywhere. When I moved here 20 years ago, (there were) massive elkhorn corals that I used to swim around that were 12 feet across in both directions. Fields of them and stalks like trees that you could swim underneath on your back and marvel looking up at. Back then, we could swim a quarter mile in one direction and see nothing more than a quarter inch between the live coral. The live coral would compete for that underwater territory. Today, I could swim 20 feet in one direction and not see any. We\u2019ve lost so much coral. It\u2019s hard to express it. It truly is a pretty devastating number.The coral reefs are threatened by ocean acidification, temperature, runoff. And then in 2014, there was something we called stony coral tissue loss disease. (It) was the sledgehammer that changed everything. It is incredibly virulent, and it started up near Miami and worked its way down. In 2016, it presented itself here, and we lost more coral in that one year than we did in all my prior years combined in diving. It was so dramatic watching this coral head die all in front of us. And we didn\u2019t know what to do, how to stop it. It was very hard to watch, and feel helpless, wishing you could do something to stop it.Why are coral reefs so important to the health of the ocean?Without them, nothing is here simply put. They are what brings the ecosystem together. The majority of what we see out there at one point in their life is spending time on a coral reef. There\u2019s small fish, not bigger than a grain of rice, all the way up to your large predatory fish, tiger sharks. The entire ecosystem\u2019s right there out on the reef at any given point. Whether it\u2019s a neon goby, whether it\u2019s a cleaner shrimp, whether it\u2019s a juvenile Spanish hogfish. Without that live coral as their home, that disappears. And when they\u2019re gone, we have fewer snappers, grouper. It\u2019s just a cascade effect because that goes all the way up the food chain. So, it\u2019s imperative that we have a healthy coral reef for us to have a full ecosystem. Without a coral reef, there\u2019s so many problems that will ensue.What is unique about your approach to the work?I knew the only way that I could make it work is through the power of the recreational dive community. What I believed would work, and is, (is they\u2019re) coming down and helping us rebuild the reef. There are a lot of them. And I truly believe at their core the vast majority want to be a part of this. And my experience so far has been just that. They want to keep doing it. They love being part of it.What I can do is tell the world of divers that are out there, \u201cLet\u2019s band together. This is a plight not only for the Keys, but the Caribbean, for the Pacific, for the Red Sea. It\u2019s all around the world. And if we, as a community of divers, don\u2019t attempt to bring back or at least get it to a self-sustaining level, the dive community will disappear.\u201dThis avenue gives those individuals another reason to come diving. They can be talking to their friends, to their families, getting them excited and spreading out those tendrils so we get more and more people down here helping us rebuild the reef.I truly believe we\u2019re going to be successful with this restoration work. I see things every time I go in the water that give me hope that we will have a sustaining coral reef."

        "name": "BMW reveals its new $120,000 electric flagship",
        "link": "https://edition.cnn.com/2022/04/20/business/bmw-i7/index.html",
        "text": "Electric vehicles, with their need for lots of expensive batteries, have often trended towards luxury. Electric cars from Porsche, Mercedes, and Audi have all hit the market in recent years. BMW has come out with its own electric cars like the iX and i4 and now the new i7, a battery-powered take on the brand\u2019s new most expensive sedan.While BMW is probably better known for its smaller 3 Series and 4 Series cars, the 7 Series is the brand\u2019s showpiece for luxury and technology. The i7 is the electric version of a new generation of the BMW 7 Series flagship unveiled on Wednesday.With a starting price of $119,300, the all-wheel-drive 536 horsepower i7 xDrive60 will be able to go 300 miles on a full charge, which is less than the competing Mercedes EQS or Lucid Air. It will also offer a V8-powered gasoline version, the 760i X-drive, with the same horsepower output and a starting price that\u2019s $300 less. It will look almost identical. A gas-powered version with a 6-cylinder engine will have a starting price of $93,300.This new version also highlights BMW\u2019s flexibility-first electric vehicle strategy, which is different from that of luxury competitors like Mercedes-Benz and Audi. While those other luxury brands\u2019 electric vehicles are based on dedicated EV chassis with little relationship to their gas-powered models, BMW emphasizes adaptable engineering as its edge.BMW has engineered all its new models so they can be built with internal combustion engines, fully electric power or as plug-in hybrids that combine both electric and gas power. BMW executives insist this is not just a matter of fitting batteries and electric motors into cars that were intended to have gas engines. Instead, these vehicles have been designed, from the outset, to be built with any of these drive systems.A major benefit of doing it this way, BMW executives say, is that it gives the companyflexibility to easily produce more \u2013 or fewer \u2013 electric cars or gas-powered cars on the same assembly lines rather than having to commit manufacturing resources just to EVs. With cars and SUVs designed to be built as either, the car maker also doesn\u2019t risk putting millions of dollars of development costs into an electric-only model that might find little demand in some markets.Another benefit, BMW chairman Oliver Zipse said, is that customers needn\u2019t choose between two completely different models when deciding whether they want an electric or gas-powered car. They can just decide they want to buy a BMW 7 Series, then choose whether they want the gasoline or electric version, just as they might decide whether they want a V8 or a straight-6 engine. Either way, customers get the same luxury car experience and design.The downside of a common engineering platform is that, to enable both electric and gasoline power, designers need compromises. Cars with internal combustion engines need a large amount of free space up front for the engine, a smaller one typically under the trunk for the fuel tank, and often a long tunnel down the middle to connect the engine to the wheels. Electric cars, on the other hand, can have smaller electric motors mounted closer to individual wheels, and while they don\u2019t have a fuel tank or a transmission tunnel, they need a large, relatively flat area, typically on the bottom of the car, for the batteries.The Mercedes EQS electric sedan, for example, has only a short hood that houses some electronic components, and it has a nearly flat floor allowing more interior storage space.Zipse insisted the 7 Series represents a superior full-size luxury sedan regardless of its power source. The driving experience will be excellent, he said, as will interior comfort and technology.\u201cThere is no car with a more spacious, luxurious second row,\u201d he said, during a meeting with journalists.Back seats are a major reason for buying this sort of large car. In full-size sedans, there generally isn\u2019t much more room (if any) in the front seats compared to smaller cars. The extra space usually goes to those in the back.As in many other high-end large cars, the back seats can recline while leg and foot rests rise from beneath seats. (BMW claims its seats recline more than competitors\u2019, though.) The front passenger seat, if it\u2019s unoccupied, can also move forward and fold down to allow more space.BMW 7 Series buyers can get an optional 31-inch high-resolution video screen that folds down from the roof to provide entertainment for back seat passengers. Combined with an available high-end stereo system and powered window shades to block out light, the 7 Series can be a better place to watch a movie than someone\u2019s own living room, according to BMW. Front seat occupants can also watch streaming videos on the center screen when the car is parked.Four-wheel steering will enable the car to turn more tightly on curvy roads and in parking lots and to change lanes more smoothly on the highway. Inside, there are few knobs and buttons. Instead, buttons appear as lighted icons on a strip of what looks like decorative trim that runs across the dashboard.The car\u2019s headlights are obscured by dark coverings while, above them, turn signals and daytime running lights are housed in prominent narrow bars. As an option, the turn signals and daytime lights can include Swarovski crystals that sparkle in sunlight. As another option, the 7 Series\u2019 large \u201ckidney\u201d grille can be outlined in lights at night.For when the driver would rather not bother, assistance technologies allow the driver to completely let go of the steering wheel for long periods on divided highways. This technology, similar to General Motors\u2019 Super Cruise, requires drives to keep their eyes on the road ahead at all times.The 7 Series can automatically drive itself into and out of parking spaces even with the driver outside the vehicle using a smartphone app. It can also drive itself through a pre-programmed course, such as around pylons in a parking garage, on its own, a feature somewhat similar to Tesla\u2019s Summon mode.A sophisticated \u201chead up display\u201d which displays data in the car\u2019s windscreen can align images and text so they appear as if laid over roads and other features in the real world. The system can also display parking regulations in the area.Performance is a core part of BMW\u2019s brand image. For decades, BMW\u2019s marketing tagline was: \u201cThe Ultimate Driving Machine.\u201d Executives now say that electric vehicles will take the lead in the carmaker\u2019s performance pantheon with the fastest and most powerful versions of its vehicles being battery-powered. With the new 7 Series, the i7 shares its ranking as the most powerful version with the V8-powered 760i. There are no plans for a V12-powered 7-series model in this generation of the car.A sophisticated air suspension works automatically to keep the car level even in fast turns. Computers can use data from GPS maps and cameras on the front of the car to predict when an upcoming curve will require the suspension system to react.BMW has said that half of the cars the company sells worldwide will be electric by 2030. That includes Rolls-Royce and Mini vehicles. Both of those iconic British brands are owned by BMW, and plan to sell only electric vehicles by 2030."

        "name": "Why lab-grown diamond sales are surging",
        "link": "https://edition.cnn.com/2022/04/27/business/diamonds-manmade-demand/index.html",
        "text": "It\u2019s proposal season, and engagements are on the rise. So are factory-made diamond sales.Not that you\u2019d know the difference. Man-made diamonds look the same as naturally occurring ones. The only noticeable difference is the price tag.\u201cThe result is really stunning,\u201d said Edahn Golan, an independent diamond industry analyst.He said March data showed the number of engagement rings sold that featured a manufactureddiamond jumped 63% compared to last year, while the number of engagement rings sold with a natural diamond declined 25% in the same period.Going back by another month, to February, the data showed the number of rings sold with lab diamonds that month surged even more, to 80% compared to a year earlier while the number fell by 13% for natural diamond engagement rings.\u201cThe big fear in the natural diamonds industry is that consumers will start accepting lab-grown diamonds in engagement rings,\u201d he said. Too late. \u201cIt\u2019s actually happening.\u201dWhy are consumers flocking to man-made diamonds? Cost is the most obvious reason. The average retail price of the most popular one carat round man-made diamond for an engagement ring in March was $2,318, Golan said.\u201cThis is substantially less \u2013 as much as 73% cheaper \u2013 than a natural diamond of the same size, cut and clarity as the man-made diamond, which would cost $8,740,\u201d he said. Plus, the lower cost allows couples to buy a bigger stone.Weddings are booming again. They're bigger and more expensive than ever\u201cA lab diamond is a real diamond, but maybe it took a few weeks to make it,\u201d said Golan. \u201cNatural diamonds were formed over 800 million to three billion years and there isn\u2019t an infinite supply of them.\u201dThis makes natural diamonds quite a bit more expensive, and prices are likely to rise as Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine has tightened the supply chain for natural raw diamonds.The sanctions, partly owned by the Russian government, which the US government identified as the world\u2019s largest diamond mining company, accounting for 28% of global diamond output.Key supply of diamonds caught up in Russia sanctionsMan-made diamonds are also becoming popular as consumers are more aware and educated about them, said Dan Moran, a third-generation diamond expert and owner of LA-based fine jeweler Concierge Diamonds. Moran said the typical buyer of man-made diamonds is typically younger than 40and very budget conscious.Mined diamonds have a controversial history that\u2019s tied to the use of child labor in some African diamond mines as well as sales of illegally-tradedthat fund conflict in war-torn areas.Among Millennials and Gen Z, their eco-conscious mindset and ethical concerns about natural diamond sourcing is another factor influencing their preference for non-traditional engagement rings,from wedding planning website The Knot.Although its slice is growing, the market share for man-made diamonds remains relatively small.Currently, about 7% of the specialty diamond jewelry market is represented by man-made diamonds, up from 3% in 2020, said Golan.Some major jewelry retailers are driving the effort to take man-made diamonds mainstream. In 2021, the world\u2019s largest jewelry company, Pandora, made a major shift by announcing it would stop using mined diamonds and would swap to lab-created diamonds in its jewelry.Pandora said it\u2019s instituting the change as part of an effort to sell sustainable jewelry, and also because consumers increasingly are asking for it.Signet,the largest jewelry company in the United States (which owns Zales, Kay Jewelers and Jared chains) called out the popularity of lab diamond jewelry in its March earnings call with analysts.Calling it a \u201cfast-growing category\u201d in its jewelry portfolio, Signet CEO Virginia Drosos told analysts that lab-created diamonds are among the big jewelry trends she expects this year.The company said it has expanded its man-made bridal jewelry selection in both its Zales and Kay Jewelers stores in response to the increaseddemand.Fine jewelry brand Charles and Colvard, which makes lab-created diamonds, said consumers don\u2019t just want to look good with the jewelry they are wearing, they also want to feel good about it.\u201cAs the momentum for conscious consumerism grows, the surge towards lab grown diamonds isn\u2019t surprising,\u201d said Don O\u2019Connell, president and CEO of Charles & Colvard. \u201c[Consumers] want to know the origins of their stones and be reassured they\u2019re conflict-free. They\u2019re embracing the choice to purchase a piece of fine jewelry that aligns with their values.\u201dLab-grown diamond brand VRAI said the pandemic, too, has sparked attention and action toward social and environmental issues. It said consumers are being more thoughtful and reassessing their purchasing habits, as well as the companies and industries they are supporting.There is, however, one important consideration for anyone buying lab-created diamonds: Man-made diamonds have little resale value.So while you may not be able to tell a natural diamond from a factory made variety, someone with a trained eye can, said Golan. Once a stone is identified as a factory diamond, even though you paid a lot less for it, you also won\u2019t get much for it.But the value of a ring isn\u2019t just monetary.\u201cAs a professional in the industry, I am asked all the time by people about what I think about a ring they have,\u201d said Moran, of Concierge Jewelers. \u201cI always say, if you love it, be happy with it. An engagement ring is a symbol of commitment and enduring love.\u201d"

        "text": "Dr. Kwane Stewart\u2019s outreach on the streets started more than a decade ago as a personal mission that he kept to himself.\u201cIt was my way to heal,\u201d said Stewart, a veterinarian whose nonprofit,, provides medical care to the pets of people experiencing homelessness. \u201cMaybe some of it was guilt. Maybe some of it was I just wanted my own little crusade.\u201dStewart had spent several years working in a county shelter in Northern California when he thought about quitting in 2011. He\u2019d long dreamed of saving animals but was instead forced to euthanize an increasing number of those that were being surrendered.\u201cIt was the recession. I\u2019m seeing hordes of unwanted pets dropped off, people who don\u2019t have the money to feed them or care for them medically,\u201d Stewart, 53, said. \u201cIt started to steal a part of my soul. I thought about leaving the veterinary profession altogether.\u201dStewart was at a crossroads, he said, desperately trying to lower the shelter\u2019s rates of euthanasia and increase adoption rates, but also struggling with the sheer number of animals dropped off there. On a whim one morning, he stopped to examine the dog of a homeless man outside a 7-11 where he got his coffee.\u201cI\u2019d seen this guy before and ignored him. Regrettably, just walked by him,\u201d Stewart said. \u201cAnd on this day, I just broke pattern because I noticed his dog had some sort of serious skin condition.\u201dStewart diagnosed and treated the dog\u2019s condition, and the animal was transformed. But for Stewart, the man\u2019s gratitude was the real wakeup call: \u201cThank you for not ignoring me\u201d were the words that Stewart says inspired his next chapter.\u201cThat was the moment I said to myself, \u2018I\u2019m going to do more of this. I\u2019m going to get back to saving animals on my terms. And I\u2019m going to do it for passion, not for pay.\u2019\u201dSoon after, Stewart began to do more outreach, setting up small drop-in clinics to provide medical care to pets whose owners couldn\u2019t afford it and walking the streets looking for unhoused individuals whose pets needed help. Right away he was struck by how much the pet owners cared for their beloved animals.\u201cThey\u2019re with each other 24/7 hours a day. Their bond and relationship is on a different level,\u201d Stewart said. \u201cBecause they\u2019re not in a traditional home, it doesn\u2019t necessarily make them less of a pet parent. A pet doesn\u2019t care about nice furniture and a big home, they want to spend it with you.\u201dAnd he found that many pet owners wanted to share their stories about their dog and their history together.With their consent, Stewart\u2019s brother, Ian, eventually began documenting some of the work and personal stories to raise awareness about animal welfare and homelessness.\u201cThey probably get criticized more than anything, especially from people in the outside world. But I\u2019ve seen people give up their last meal for their pet and people who have $3 to their name, and after I\u2019m done with the treatment, they will try and give me that $3,\u201d Stewart said.His brother encouraged him to spread the word and join forces with others to provide street care, and soon more like-minded animal welfare professionals jumped on board.Genesis Rendon, a registered veterinary nurse who Stewart calls his \u201cright-hand,\u201d had worked in the veterinary field for nearly two decades and was doing her own street outreach when she teamed up with him in 2016. Today, as a lead volunteer for Project Street Vet, she is often by Stewart\u2019s side in homeless camps and on Los Angeles\u2019 Skid Row assisting animals in need.\u201cNow it\u2019s spreading across the country,\u201d Stewart said. \u201cI\u2019m building a network of trusted volunteers, technicians with hospitals and clinics we can call on. These are all people who just reached out and said, \u2018I\u2019m inspired by what you do. How do I do it?\u2019\u201dStewart says they can treat about 80% of the cases they see out of a small portable kit. Treatments include antibiotics, vaccines, and anti-inflammatories as well as deworming and flea and tick medications.\u201cIt\u2019s boots on the ground,\u201d Stewart said, adding that their group will also help connect animals in need to clinic services. \u201cAnd whenever we can, we advocate for or assist people in getting their animals spayed and neutered.\u201dStewart\u2019s work with Project Street Vet is all volunteer, and the organization has expanded to other cities, including Orlando and Atlanta.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter what your situation is or what your background or past is, I see a pet in need, and I see a person who cares for them dearly who just needs some help. \u2026 It\u2019s at no cost to them. It\u2019s free.\u201dSince he started, Stewart and his volunteer teams have treated thousands of animals while giving their human parents hope and dignity, too.\u201cI will say this about the people I\u2019ve met who have pets on the streets,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are some of the most remarkable pet parents I\u2019ve ever met.\u201d"

        "text": "Six months after the grassroots Amazon Labor Union scored a historic victory by becoming the first to unionize one of the tech giant\u2019s US facilities, it now appears to be grappling with setbacks and delays.Workers at a California Amazon facility withdrew their petition late last week to unionize with the ALU, just days after the labor groupan Amazon facility in upstate New York.Kayla Blado, a spokesperson for the National Labor Relations Board, confirmed to CNN Business on Tuesday that the petition for a union election at the ONT8 facility in Moreno Valley, California, had been withdrawn. Blado added that the petitioner does not have to provide a reason to the NLRB for doing so. The move to withdraw comes roughly two weeks after the petition was submitted, per the NLRB\u2019sof the case.Amazon workers vote against forming union in upstate New York, dealing setback to grassroots labor groupIn an email to CNN Business, ALU President Chris Smalls played down the significance of the withdrawn petition. \u201cThe withdrawal isn\u2019t nothing to worry about,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will be refilling within the next few weeks just as we did with our JFK8 campaign,\u201d Smalls added, referring to the name of the unionized facility in Staten Island, New York.Smalls did not offer a reason for the decision to withdraw and potentially refile the petition.Since the watershed union win at JFK8, the ALU hasn\u2019t seen success with organizing efforts at other Amazon facilities. In addition to the Amazon workers near Albany voting against joining the union last week, the ALU also failed to win enough votes to unionize a smaller Amazon outpostMoreover, Amazon has refused to recognize or meet with the union at JFK8\u2014 and continues to challenge the union\u2019s election win. Labor experts say the saga reveals how difficult it is to organize a union under current labor laws.Amazon has long maintained that it prefers working with employees directly, versus through a union. After the workers near Albany voted against forming a union, an Amazon spokesperson said the company is \u201cglad\u201d to see \u201cthey chose to keep the direct relationship with Amazon as we think that this is the best arrangement for both our employees and customers.\u201dDespite the uphill battle the union faces, Smalls previously told CNN Business that he sees the increase in organizing efforts at Amazon facilities across the country as its own victory.\u201cThe expansion of the ALU is definitely historical by itself,\u201d Smalls said. He added that the group has been fielding an explosion of interest from Amazon workers across the country since the ALU\u2019s original win in Staten Island in April."

        "text": "Withgripping much of the United States, travelers may be wondering how their planes are made safe for flying.The short answer: Along with regular deicing of planes before take-off, airlines put their aircraft through rigorous testing in some of the coldest places on the planet before they are ever pressed into service.CNN has previously followed a team of Airbus engineers, mechanics and test pilots. Their mission was to see how their test plane, a long-range A350 XWB, withstood extreme cold.The Airbus team left the warmth and comfort of their Toulouse, France, base to perform various extreme-weather trials on the test plane in frigid Iqaluit, the capital of Canada\u2019s eastern Arctic territory of Nunavut.The ground and in-air tests included operating the A350 XWB in temperatures reaching down to  -18 Fahrenheit (-28 degrees Celsius), thrust-reversed tests with snow and a local flight test.All new plane models must be tested in extreme environmental conditions, from freezing to intense heat.\u201cComing to an extreme place means we can break everything,\u201d Airbus\u2019 head of flight operations Pedro Dias told local reporters.Extreme cold affects various parts of an aircraft in different ways.

Its active monthly users have skyrocketed this year by more than 315%, according toperformance.We joined the app and talked to users to get a deeper understanding of how BeReal works and what you need to know about it.BeReal is a social media app that encourages users to share a slice of their life in real time. It was launched in early 2020 by an entrepreneur in France but a majority of its users \u2013\u2013 have signed up this calendar year.As its name suggests, the focus is on authenticity. Users are invited once a day to share a photo of what they\u2019re doing at that moment, giving friends and others an unvarnished glimpse into their life.It has no filters and no edit buttons. So if your hair is a mess at that moment and your view is of a rainy parking lot, that\u2019s what people will see.The result is a far cry from the polished, overly curated photos popular on other social media platforms.The concept of BeReal is simple. Once you download the app, you get a notification once a day that it\u2019s time to \u201cBeReal.\u201d  That means you have two minutes to snap and post a photo of what you\u2019re doing, no matter how mundane.There\u2019s no set time \u2013 the notification comes at random times of the day \u2013 adding to the app\u2019s mystique.\u201cPush notifications are sent around the world simultaneously at different times each day,\u201d the company said in a statement. \u201cIt\u2019s a secret on how the time is chosen every day, it\u2019s not random.\u201dThat means the potential window into your life can open at any time. When it does, the app invites you to take a photo of what you\u2019re up to at that moment. It takes a dual photo \u2013 a selfie and one showing what\u2019s in front of you.  (BeRealyet.)The result is a social feed filled with unedited photos of people doing mostly everyday, unglamorous things \u2013 lounging in pajamas, doing homework, riding the bus, microwaving their dinner.With only one post a day, there\u2019s no clutter of friends\u2019 pictures to mindlessly scroll through.You can only see friends\u2019 posts if you share a photo, which eliminates lurkers. Some people turn off their location for privacy reasons, since the app works in real time.Georgetown University student Ben Telerski, 21, is an avid social media user and joined the app in August.\u201cWhat I like about BeReal is I am able to make connections with my friends via social media on a platform that does not incentivize likes, comments, or being artificial. \u2026 solely showing your friends what you are doing at the moment that the daily alert goes off,\u201d says Telerski, a junior majoring in government.Telerski says the posts he sees on the app are generally more authentic compared to other social media platforms.\u201cI try to post as soon as I see the notification, even if I am just sitting in bed or walking to class,\u201d he says. \u201cI think the amount of authenticity depends on the persona each person creates on social media. If someone tries to keep their social media presence highly polished and produced, BeReal is not the app to use.\u201dWhen you click on the once-a-day BeReal notification, your camera opens within the app along with a timer with a two-minute countdown. You have until the timer runs out to take a picture of what\u2019s in front of you. At the same time, your rear-facing camera snaps a selfie.The app will share both images. You can retake them anytime during the two minutes and share them with friends when you\u2019re ready.BeReal also allows users to take and post the photo later in the day. But it lets your friends know how many hours past the notification that you posted. In short, it puts you on blast for your lack of spontaneity.BeReal has tapped into marketing on college campuses. It recruits young users via itswhich allows students to host events that educate others about the app.Telerski believes the app is popular because it\u2019s an antidote to the pressures to look perfect online.\u201cI have seenabout the negative mental health impacts that social media has on Gen Z. I do not know if BeReal is directly attempting to combat this problem, but it is certainly making some ground toward that goal,\u201d he says.BeReal won\u2019t make you famous, if you want to become an influencer you can stay on TikTok and Instagram.BeRealMorgan Nott, 26, manages a tea shop in Reno and is a newbie on the app. She started using it last week at a friend\u2019s suggestion. Nott says she finds it refreshing to get a non-airbrushed, non-idealized glimpse into other people\u2019s lives.\u201cIt\u2019s the authenticity of it that makes it so appealing. Users aren\u2019t as glamorized or fake as some can portray themselves on other platforms,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s something different.\u201dIn a statement, BeReal says its goal is to create \u201can alternative to addictive social networks\u201d that focus on amassing influence, it says.\u201cBeReal is your chance to show your friends who you really are,\u201d  the company says. \u201cBeReal won\u2019t make you famous, if you want to become an influencer you can stay on TikTok and Instagram.\u201dThe app doesn\u2019t give you much time to put on makeup or stage your surroundings before you snap and post photos.But some users may still try to curate their lives on the app.\u201cThere is the potential to be just as artificial on BeReal as people tend to be on other platforms,\u201d Telerski says. Some people might ignore the notification to post at a certain time and wait to post until they are dressed up and out at dinner with friends, he says.\u201cIt is not in the spirit of BeReal and entirely defeats the purpose,\u201d he says. \u201cBeReal should be full of pictures of (people) walking, doing homework and sitting in bed watching Netflix.\u201dThe young people CNN spoke to have no plans to give up Instagram, TikTok and other social media apps.Nott says she plans to keep letting her guard down on BeReal \u2013 and to keep posting on other social media platforms as well.Telerski says he tries to maintain a certain level of authenticity on social media regardless of the platform. Authenticity is determined by a person, not an app, he says.\u201cFor those who think we need a new social media app in order to be truly authentic, maybe we should take that as a sign to be more authentic throughout our existing social media presence,\u201d he says.\u201cThink about what social media was originally intended for \u2013 real connection through family and friends keeping up with your life. Maybe we should get back to that.\u201d"

        "text": "In the space of a week, a 30-year-old entrepreneur once hailed as a modern-day J.P. Morgan watched his digital empire, including billions of his own fortune, evaporate in a death spiral that\u2019s shaken the foundations of the trillion-dollar crypto industry.On Thursday, Sam Bankman-Fried issued a mea culpa: \u201cI f**ked up,\u201d he wrote in a, apologizing to investors and customers of FTX, the exchange platform he founded in 2019. By Friday morning, FTX said Bankman-Fried had resigned as CEO and that the firm was'Gold standard' crypto exchange FTX files for bankruptcy. CEO resignsFailures are not uncommon in the murky, largely unregulated world of crypto, but FTX is not your average crypto startup. Its near-collapse this week represents a potential turning point for an industry that many critics say has been given a pass for far too long.So, what happened to FTX, and why is the entire crypto space freaking out about it? There are still a lot of uncertainties, but here\u2019s what we know.Last week, the crypto news website CoinDeskbased on a leaked financial document from Bankman-Fried\u2019s hedge fund, Alameda Research.The report suggested that Alameda\u2019s business rested on shaky financial footing. Namely, that the bulk of its assets are held in FTT, a digital token minted by Alameda\u2019s sister firm, FTX. That was a red flag for investors, as the companies were, on paper at least, separate. Alameda\u2019s disproportionate holdings of the token, however, suggested the two were much more closely linked.On Sunday, the CEO of Binance, FTX\u2019s much larger rival, said hiscompany was liquidating $580 million worth of FTX holdings. That set off a firestorm of draw downs that FTX didn\u2019t have the cash to facilitate.By Monday, concerns about Alameda and FTX had bled into the broader crypto market. ButBankman-Fried was defiant, tweeting that FTX and its assets were \u201cfine.\u201d He also sparred with the CEO of Binance, Changpeng Zhao, whose tweet had fueled the run on FTX deposits.There was clearly bad blood between the two, which is why it shocked the industry when the pair announced a tentative deal Tuesdayfor Binance to bail out FTX.\u201cThis afternoon, FTX asked for our help,\u201d Zhao tweeted thatafternoon, noting that there was a \u201csignificant liquidity crunch\u201d at the company and that Binance would have to conduct corporate due diligence before going forward with any deal.Almost immediately after getting a look at under the hood, though, Binance began to backtrack.Meanwhile, Bankman-Fried\u2019s personal fortune also tumbled. According to the Bloomberg Billionaire Index, Bankman-Fried\u2019s net worth cratered 94% in a single day, from more than $15 billion to just under $1 billion \u2014 the biggest one-day loss ever clocked by the index. (The estimate of his wealth was based on the assumption that Binance would ultimately bail out FTX, where much of Bankman-Fried\u2019s personal assets are held. Which means his net worth may have farther to fall.)On Wednesday, cryptocurrencies continued to slump as investor anxiety about the FTX bailout spread. Bitcoin and ether, the two most popular tokens, both hit their lowest level in two years.The selloff deepened after media reports emerged that Binance was leaning toward walking away from the deal. Sure enough, on Wednesday afternoon, Zhao tweeted a withering assessment of FTX\u2019s problems:\u201cIn the beginning, our hope was to be able to support FTX\u2019s customers to provide liquidity, but the issues are beyond our control or ability to help.\u201dHe also alluded to allegations of \u201cmishandled funds\u201d and investigations by US regulators.Binance was out. FTX\u2019s best shot at a lifeline was gone.The full extent of FTX\u2019s financial problems aren\u2019t yet known, but multiple reports say the firm is facing an $8 billion shortfall. Without a quick infusion of equity, Bankman-Friedtold investors Thursday, the firm was facing bankruptcy.Since the Binance deal fell apart, Bankman-Fried has been scrambling to raise funds. On Thursday, tweeted that there were \u201ca number of players\u201d the firm was in talks with.\u201cWe\u2019re spending the week doing everything we can to raise liquidity,\u201d he wrote in his apology thread. \u201cEvery penny\u201d of that, plus the remaining collateral, will go toward making users whole, followed by investors and employees.\u201dDespite its reputation as a dependable, low-risk investment portal, FTX\u2019s business appears to have been built on a complex, extremely risky kind of leveraged trading.Customers deposited their money to engage in crypto trading. But it appears that FTX instead took billions of dollars worth of that money and loaned it out to its sister firm, Alameda, to fund those high-risk bets,Bloomberg columnist Matt Levine put it another way: \u201cFTX took its customers\u2019 money and traded it for a pile of magic beans, and now the beans are worthless.\u201dAt the end of the day, FTX experienced the crypto equivalent of a classic bank run. Customers wanted their money out, and FTX didn\u2019t have it.In traditional finance, customers\u2019 funds are protected by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, which insures deposits. The FDIC does not insure stocks or cryptocurrencies, however, leaving the fate of FTX\u2019s customers and investors in question.One of those investors was the Ontario Teachers\u2019 Pension Plan, which said it invested $95 million in both FTX International and its US entity \u201cto gain small-scale exposure to an emerging area in the financial technology sector.\u201dThursday, the plan noted that any loss on its investment would have \u201climited impact\u201d as it represents less than 0.05% of its total net assets.After a chaotic week, FTX filed for bankruptcy. In a statement, FTX said John Ray III has been appointed the new CEO and that many exchange employees are expected to stay on to run the firm as it goes through the Chapter 11 process.Ray said bankruptcy protection will give FTX the chance to \u201cassess its situation and develop a process to maximize recoveries for stakeholders.\u201dRegulators are now swirling to investigate what went wrong at FTX, and some lawmakers are demanding a crackdown.Securities regulators in the Bahamas, where FTX is based, froze some of the embattled exchange\u2019s assets on Thursday. Both the Justice Department and Securities and Exchange Commission are investigating FTX, according to the. (The DOJ declined to comment, and the SEC said it does not comment on the existence or nonexistence of investigations.)The collapse of FTX is \u201ca loud warning bell that cryptocurrencies can fail,\u201d Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown the chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, said in a statement on Thursday. \u201cAnd just like we saw with over-the-counter derivatives that led to a financial crisis, these failures can have a ripple effect on consumers and other parts of our financial system.\u201d"

        "link": "https://edition.cnn.com/cnn-underscored/money/first-citi-credit-card-citi-premier",
        "text": "While our choice for the besthas long been the, if you\u2019re already gotten that card or you\u2019re unable to apply for Chase credit cards due to that issuer\u2019s application rules, there\u2019s a strong runner-up to consider: the.Not only is the Citi Premier a solid contender in its own right, but if you\u2019re interested in travel rewards, it potentially should be the first Citi card you apply for before considering. Yes, even our.Why? Let\u2019s dive into theand the application rules related to it so you can see firsthand why we think it should be at the top of your list when looking for a new Citi credit card.Right now, newcard holders can earnafter spending $4,000 on purchases within the first three months after opening the account. That\u2019s the highest bonus you can currently get on. Plus, with the current limited time welcome offer, new cardmembers will earn a total of 10 ThankYou points per dollar spent on hotel, car rentals and attractions (excluding air travel) booked through the Citi Travel portal through June 30, 2024.You can earn 60,000 bonus points for travel with the Citi Premier credit cardExactly how much are those 60,000 points worth? Well, theearns points known as Citi ThankYou Rewards, which can be easily redeemed for gift cards or for any flight booked through Citi\u2019s travel portal at a rate of 1 cent per point. That makes the card\u2019s sign-up bonus worth $600 at a bare minimum, which is a great haul for a card that only has a $95 annual fee.However, with a little bit of effort, you can get even more value for your points than that. That\u2019s because Citi also allows you to transfer your ThankYou points to any of its 16 partner loyalty programs, which now includes two hotel programs \u2014and.While using your points this way requires some extra effort and flexibility, you can potentially get much more value for your rewards, especially if you redeem them for first or business class flights. That\u2019s why frequent flyer websitevalues Citi ThankYou points at 1.7 cents apiece. At that rate, the 60,000 bonus points on the Citi Premier are worth $1,020 toward travel.Granted, there are some credit cards outside of Citior more, it\u2019s important to keep in mind that not all points are created equal, and 100,000 points on some cards are worth less than the 60,000 points on the.Also, some cards require a ridiculous amount of spending to earn the entire sign-up bonus \u2014 as much as $15,000 in some cases. But the $4,000 spending requirement on thebreaks down to just $1,333 a month for each of the first three months you have the card.Similar to most major banks, Citi has rules on how often a customer can be approved for a credit card. Although Citi doesn\u2019t limit the number of cards you can open, it does have restrictions on how many cards you can apply for within a given time.Overall, you can only apply for one Citi credit card every eight days, and a maximum of two Citi cards every 65 days. That policy covers all of the issuer\u2019s credit cards, including airline, travel rewards and cash back options.Seems pretty straightforward and easy to understand, right? Except that Citi also has a 24-month \u201ccard family\u201d rule. This means if you\u2019ve opened or closed any cardin the past 24 months, you won\u2019t be able to receive a sign-up bonus when applying for a new card from that same family.That rule is a little more complicated, so let\u2019s look at it using theas an example. The Citi Premier earns Citi ThankYou points, making it part of the family of Citi cards that also earn ThankYou points, which includes theand the no-longer-available Citi Prestige Card.So if you open acard, you won\u2019t be able to also get the sign-up bonus on the Citi Premier card until 24 months have elapsed. And since theoffers a much higher sign-up bonus \u2014 four times as high as the Citi Rewards+ card \u2014 and better rewards, you\u2019ll want to make sure to apply for the Citi Premier card first.The good news is our benchmarkisn\u2019t part of any Citi card family. So you can safely apply for it after you get the\u2014 as soon as eight days after if you want it that fast. And these two cards actually pair together very well, because if you have both, you can convert the cash back earned on your Citi Double Cash into points, and combine them with the points you earn on the Citi Premier, giving you one big pot of travel rewards.Compared to all of the other, thehas the most robust set of bonus categories. You\u2019ll earn 3 points for every dollar you spend on air travel, hotels, gas stations, supermarkets and restaurants (including takeout), and 1 point per dollar on all other purchases. Plus, there\u2019s no limit to the number of points you can earn.This also brings up a second reason that thepairs well with the. Since the Citi Double Cash earns 2% cash back on everything you buy \u2014 1% when you make a purchase, and another 1% when you pay it off \u2014 and you can convert your cash back to ThankYou points when you also have the Citi Premier, you can effectively maximize the rewards you\u2019re earning on all your purchases by having both cards.Read CNN Underscored's review of the Citi Double Cash CardHow? Well, if you have both cards in your purse or wallet, you\u2019d pull out thewhenever you\u2019re making a purchase in one of its bonus categories in order to earn 3 points per dollar, and then you\u2019d pull out thefor everything else to earn 2% cash back, which is effectively 2 points per dollar when you convert the cash back into ThankYou points. That way you\u2019re always earning at least twice as much as the basic 1 point per dollar on everything you buy.Theis also the only Citi card you can currently get that, on its own, allows you to transfer points to any of Citi\u2019s 16 travel partners, potentially increasing the value of your points. All of the other Citi cards earn cash back or \u201cbasic\u201d ThankYou points that can only be redeemed for gift cards or used through the Citi travel portal at 1 cent apiece.Citi ThankYou points transfer at a 1-to-1 ratio to all partners, which means the 60,000 points from the Citi Premier sign-up offer equals 60,000 points or miles in any of these 16 airline or hotel programs:Additionally, at times, Citi runs promotions for transfer bonuses of 10% to 30% when transferring your points to certain partners during certain time periods, which means you can get even more bang for your buck. The only rule when it comes to transferring points is that they must be transferred in blocks of 1,000, and no more than 50,000 points can be transferred at a given time.Citi also makes it incredibly easy to transfer points from one person\u2019s ThankYou Rewards account to another. This is a great feature if you\u2019re looking to combine points among friends or family members. But you need to make sure you\u2019re ready to use your ThankYou points before you combine them with someone else, because points shared with another person expire 90 days from the date they\u2019re received, and you can transfer a maximum of 100,000 ThankYou points in a calendar year.Both theand thehave $95 annual fees, so they\u2019re comparable in cost. With the Sapphire Preferred, you\u2019ll earn Chase Ultimate Rewards points, which transfer to a different set of partners than Citi ThankYou points. Chase offers three hotel partners in addition to 11 airline partners, while Citi has more partnerships available but only two hotel partners.Chase also offers more domestic partner opportunities, such as United Airlines and Hyatt hotels, while Citi focuses on international carriers. But Citi partners with many airlines that don\u2019t partner with anyone else, such as Turkish Airlines.Thealso offers many shopping and travel protection benefits. For example, if your flight is delayed overnight, causing you to have to fly out the following morning, the Sapphire Preferred will reimburse you for any unexpected out-of-pocket costs \u2014 such as a night at a hotel, food and taxis \u2014 up to $500 per passenger.6 reasons to get the Chase Sapphire PreferredWhile the Citi Premier no longer offers these nice-to-have perks, it does have more bonus categories, and in some cases at a higher rate. For instance, theearns 3 points per dollar on travel purchases, whereas theearns only 2 points per dollar unless you book through Ultimate Rewards.At the end of the day, they are both great credit cards that you\u2019ll want to consider if you\u2019re thinking about earning travel rewards for the first time. While theremains our favorite, theis an underrated contender, and should definitely be the first Citi card on your list. You can even apply for both and diversify your points \u2014 the ultimate way to ensure you have the right points when looking to go on your next much-needed vacation."

And you\u2019ll earn a fixed 1.5% cash back on all other purchases.The other difference between the two is that the Freedom Unlimited is a Visa \u2014 not a Mastercard Elite \u2014 which means you won\u2019t receive some of the valuable benefits that come with the Freedom Flex, such as.Earning rewards for paying your rent has been hard to come by, until now. With theyou can earn 1 point for every dollar spent on your monthly rent, up to $100,000 in rent payments per year. You can even pay landlords that don\u2019t accept credit card as a form of payment.

All partners transfer at a 1-to-1 ratio. Or, for the ultimate flexibility, you can use your points through Bilt\u2019s travel booking site at a fixed 1.25 cents per point. This means if you have 10,000 Bilt points, they can be used towards $125 in travel purchases when booking through the portal.The Bilt Mastercard also offers many favorable benefits, such as,,,, Lyft credits, a three-month DashPass membership and Mastercard World Elite Concierge services (see).Theis one of the best when it comes to earning cash back for your everyday purchases. With this no-annual-fee card, you don\u2019t have to worry about category bonuses, and instead you\u2019ll earn 2% cash back \u2014 1% when you buy something and another 1% when you pay it off \u2014 on every purchase you make. There\u2019s also no cap to the amount of cash back you can earn.This card is marketed as a cash back credit card, but you\u2019re actually earning. While these points have limited travel redemption options, if, such as the, you can  transfer your points earned with Citi Double Cash Card to all of Citi\u2019s 16 partner airline and hotels.Here\u2019s how to combine multiple Citi credit cards for the ultimate travel rewards.Another advantage of the Citi Double Cash is that it offers a relatively long 18-month introductory 0% APR for balance transfers \u2014 a great way to pay off your debt (though make sure you pay it off, because the APR jumps to a variable 18.74% to 28.74% after the introductory offer ends). And you have up to four months after you open the account to make your first balance transfer and still have it qualify for the introductory offer.However, the Citi Double Cash doesn\u2019t offer many perks, such as travel or purchase protection. It also comes with a 3% foreign transaction fee, so it\u2019s not the card you\u2019ll want to bring while traveling overseas."

I can still remember the smell of burning, onlookers screaming, faces at the windows and people crying for help. The fire killed 72 people. In moments like this, you are left numb, utterly powerless. You question if this nightmare is really happening.As reports of the Bronx fire came in, I knew that the families and friends of residents in that apartment block, and the local community, would be living the same trauma. They would be holding on to hope that their loved ones survived. And in their shock, they would be questioning how the fire happened.We don\u2019t yet know the full circumstances of the Bronx fire, yet there are already striking similarities to those at Grenfell. Much like in, the New York blaze started in one apartment, there was not a functioning fire door and smoke then spread through the.When the fire happened at Grenfell Tower, it turned the spotlight on whether the construction, refurbishment and management of the block, as well as existing building regulations, were adequate, and in particular how external cladding \u2013 placed on the building solely for aesthetic purposes \u2013 significantly contributed to th. These questions sparked a larger fight for housing equality that i.Other similarities between the London and Bronx fires show race and social class must be part of the conversation about these catastrophes.

At minimum there should be a mandatory component of any tenancy agreement to know what to do if a fire occurs in their home and appropriate fire doors fitted, and this should be supported by regular public information announcements.Today my heartfelt thoughts and prayers are with the families and friends of thewho died in the New York fire. We must change our mindset and see these buildings not just as real estate, but as people\u2019s homes. An equitable standard of safety in our homes, whether for the poor or the wealthy, should exist \u2013 because all our lives are equally valuable."

        "name": "These Supreme Court arguments are about far more than vaccine mandates",
        "link": "https://edition.cnn.com/2022/01/06/opinions/biden-vaccine-mandates-supreme-court-arguments-rodgers/index.html",
        "text": "Editor\u2019s Note:Jennifer Rodgers is a former federal prosecutor, adjunct professor of clinical law at NYU School of Law, lecturer-in-law at Columbia Law School and a CNN legal analyst. The opinions expressed here are her own. Readat CNN.Covid-19 vaccine mandates are up for consideration at the US Supreme Court once again, with arguments\u2013 but this time with a couple of twists. Two consolidated cases have made their way to the high court for emergency action, meaning the appellants are seeking to influence whether these mandates take effect now, while litigation proceeds, over whether they are legal and constitutional.One of the casesthe Biden administration\u2019s vaccine-or-testing requirement for employees of large businesses. The other addresses the administration\u2019s vaccine mandate (which includes medical and religious exemptions) on health care providers receiving funding through Medicare or Medicaid.You might be thinking that the Supreme Courton numerous cases about Covid-19 vaccine mandates \u2013 and you would be correct.But these two cases are a. Because they involve actions by federal agencies \u2013 the Department of Labor\u2019s Occupational Health and Safety Administration and the Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services \u2013 the key legal question raised here is not whether the actions are reasonable and necessary in light of the pandemic, but whether Congress provided the agencies with the authority to issue these directives under the relevant statutes. The states challenging the federal mandates have also argued that they impinge unconstitutionally on state sovereignty.Strategist: Biden's vaccine mandate helps business get back to businessAs a result, the prior decisions and analyses of the Court in mandate-related cases are not particularly helpful in predicting what the justice will do. Nor will the rulings here necessarily affect further efforts by states, localities and private businesses to determine their own vaccination policies. Instead, the potential importance of the rulings here could be in foreshadowing the conservative majority\u2019s view of executive power: specifically, how much control the federal government has over rule-making, an issue which obviously applies to legal questions far beyond vaccine mandates.Of course, this is an emergency application and not a ruling on the merits, but part of the legal standard that justices must consider in determining whether to issue an injunction is whether they think those seeking to stop the mandates from taking effect are likely to prevail when the merits are ultimately considered. As a result, the ruling may provide a window into the court\u2019s thinking that may be instructive to lower courts and serve as a precursor of what will happen when the court is faced with the same or a similar issue in the future.The other interesting thing about this week\u2019s arguments is thethat got us here. The cases to be argued are part of the so-called \u201cshadow docket,\u201d where the Supreme Court considers matters that are not on the regular court calendar, such as requests for emergency action. These matters come to one justice and are virtually always decided without oral argument and without a published opinion.2022: Like 2020, but with more disastersShadow docket rulings are often irreversible, and in recent years the number of emergency applications taken up by the court has skyrocketed. As one example where the federal government used the shadow docket in an attempt to overturn disfavored lower court rulings, the Trump administration filed suits to overturn numerous lower court holds on prisoner executions. The court, as part of its emergency powers,for the lethal injection of 13 inmates, the first federal executions in the United States in 17 years.The shadow docketfor the court leaving in place a draconian law banning most abortions in Texas last January, a decision which led to the announcement of congressional oversight hearings. In part due to the Texas abortion case, the shadow docketthe subject of much criticism because of the lack of process and transparency it entails. Even as the number of emergency applications, it is unusual for a justice to refer such a matter to the full court, and it\u2019s exceedingly rare for the court to grant oral argument.Yet this is exactly what happened here, as Justices Samuel Alito and Brett Kavanaugh, who received the emergency requests,to the whole court and the court, as it had in the Texas abortion law case, scheduled the case for oral argument \u2013 this time eventhe justices\u2019 holiday break to do so.In setting this for immediate argument in such an unusual manner, is the court merely reacting to the importance of the matter, with nearly 100 million people impacted? Is it an implicit acknowledgment ofthe court has faced over its shadow docket activities in the past few years?Does it mean that at least some on the court anticipate that their ruling will significantly affect federal agency authority for other cases down the road? Time will tell on these questions, but one bet seems safe, given the unusual treatment of this case: At Friday\u2019s arguments we should all pay close attention."

And that is looking increasingly chancy.\u201cWe are reaching a point where Iran\u2019s nuclear escalation will have eliminated the substance of the JCPOA,\u201d theearlier this month of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, the Iran nuclear agreement signed by Britain, France, Germany,, China, the United States, as well as Iran, in 2015.Three years later, President Donald Trump withdrew the US from the pact and reimposed sanctions on Iran. While the JCPOA is still recognized by the remaining signatories, Iran hasan accelerated program of enriching uranium that could allow it to create a weapon more quickly.Every delay in the negotiations thatafter a brief break in the eighth round in Vienna allows Iran time to make further progress toward the ability \u2013 if not the will \u2013 to make at least a testable nuclear weapon. And indeed there is a theoretical off-ramp barely two weeks away when the sixth month of negotiations is reached and the talks could come to a real, and toxic, end.Even now, there isIran may be desperately close to the ability to create a nuclear device.\u201cIran today is probably within a month or two of having enough material that could, with further enrichment, be sufficient to actually build a bomb,\u201d Gary Sick, head of Columbia University\u2019s Gulf/2000 project and the Iran expert on the National Security Council under President Jimmy Carter, told me via email interview.\u201cThe skill and experience that they have developed in this round, however, will not be forgotten. So even if Iran returns to the original status of 2015, it will be better poised to get there quicker the next time, if there is a next time,\u201d Sick added.However Sick and others believe that Iran has not yet made the final determination to go that last step toward a testable nuclear device. The Grand Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who will make such a decision,atomic bomb is \u201charam\u201d or forbidden in Islam. Moreover, Sick points out that Iran is at least a year or two away from producing a device that could be mounted on a missile and fired at a neighboring country or beyond.Meanwhile the White House is playing the blame game \u2013 ever more vocally laying Iran\u2019s accelerating progress toward a bomb on Trump\u2019s withdrawal from the process. But in fact, the US is at risk of taking its eye off the ball,talks with Russia over Ukraine, without seeing how they might in some fashion be tied together.For Putin, Kazakhstan is a domino too big to fallSince the breakup of the Soviet Union, Moscow no longer shares a land border with Iran, but the last thing Russia wants is another nuclear power that close by. Bring China into the equation and this quickly becomes three-dimensional chess. While concerned about a broader conflict in the Middle East that could disrupt some of its energy supplies, China shares few of Russia\u2019s fears of a nuclear-armed Iran.At the same time, as one of the very few customers for Iranian oil under sanctions, China has few incentives to see sanctions lifted. The White House insists, however, that the administration has been able to engage with Russia and China within the JCPOA format and that it is still only Iran that is dragging its heels.Still, both Secretary of State Antony Blinken and his top negotiator Wendy Sherman, the original architect of the JCPOA under President Barack Obama, haveon the Russia-Ukraine talks and seeking European agreement to sanctions should Putin invade. Indeed, when Blinken was interviewed on NPR last week, he spent much of his time talking about Russia and Ukraine. At the end, when talk turned to Iran,most of his energy to blaming Trump.There is no question that the immediate impact of a Russian invasion of Ukraine would be most appalling, but the inexorable moves by Iran toward enrichment of uranium and the evidence that the US appears at least to have prioritized negotiations with Russia over Ukraine cannot be lost on a very savvy Iranian leadership.Senior Biden administration officials have told me that they believe they are able to engage with Russia and China with respect to the JCPOA. The key evidence will be where the negotiations stand when they reopen following the current break.Indeed now, virtually everyone with a stake in Iran\u2019s nuclear capabilities is beginning to reposition itself in the event of a breakdown in the negotiations.At a meeting of Chinese and Iranian foreign ministers last week,a 25-year cooperation agreement aimed at strengthening economic and political ties. China has become a major customer for Iranian oil,590,000 barrels per day last year, the highest level since Trump reimposed sanctions. Lifting sanctions could threaten that exclusivity.At the same time, Russia and Iran are also strengthening links, with President Vladimir Putin to host his counterpart President Ebrahim Raisi later this montha 20-year trade and military agreement.Other nations in the region have also begun hedging their bets. Israel and Russia have big stakes in Iran\u2019s nuclear capabilities \u2013 perhaps even larger than Western Europe or the United States, which isof any Iranian missile that\u2019s been tested so far.Earlier this month, Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett and Putin \u201cagreed on continued close cooperation on this area,\u201dIsraeli prime minister\u2019s office. The two countries already have athat allows Israeli warplanes to attack Iranian bases and weapons convoys in Syria \u2013 deconfliction being an essential extension if Israel were to mount an air strike against Iranian nuclear facilities.Elsewhere, Saudi Arabia has begunto Beijing. China is helping the Saudis with everything from a missile development program to a massive desalination network, and is already one of Saudi Arabia\u2019s largest trading partners. It\u2019s a relationship that could prove a fruitful source of nuclear technology should Iran develop its own weapon.Back at the JCPOA negotiating table, Iran\u2019s key conditions remain all but unchanged. Nournews, a news serviceIran\u2019s Supreme National Security Council, reported last week that \u201cverification and assurances\u201d \u2013 code for the continued demand that all sanctions be lifted \u2013 are a precondition for Iran consenting to resume the agreement.But there are more questions on which any successful outcome at the Iran talks may well hinge.Will Iran settle for being a state permanently on a nuclear threshold and will that satisfy the security needs of its neighbors and potential targets?For the moment, the US must thread this impossibly slim eye of a needle. It is difficult to see how the JCPOA process could survive an utter breakdown in East-West security talks or more particularly any incursion into Ukraine by Russian forces.But the Biden administration must find a way to stay focused on Iran. At the next round of Vienna talks, there must be some real, concrete evidence of progress."

While it may seem easier \u2013 far less confusing, at least \u2013 to just call off New Year\u2019s and hibernate (again), with certain precautions it\u2019s still possible towith (some) friends and family.The prospect of a new year ahead \u2013 in combination with profound Covid fatigue and growing anxiety about rising cases \u2013 sharpens our current reality, that at this point in the pandemic, we have information that is both reassuring and less-so. While the chance of getting Covid-19 is still very real, vaccination and boosting, coupled with additional protective behaviors like proper masking, can greatly reduce the risk of infection and severe illness. This raises a few key questions. How do people assess their own risk and how much risk they take on? And how to weigh this risk against the desire, and very real benefits, of returning to normal life?Nearly two years in (and for some, longer), few want to return to lockdown or miss out on spending important occasions with family and friends.

And it\u2019s important to remember that assessing risk isn\u2019t just about protecting oneself, but also about protecting others \u2013 including unvaccinated or unboosted children, older populations and those with autoimmune diseases or other conditions that put them at higher risk.Certainly, it can be difficult to know what\u2019s safe, beyond canceling everything. Government guidance on,andkeep changing. What\u2019s consideredmay soon change. Right now, \u201cfully vaccinated\u201d isthe US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as having received two shots of either the Moderna or Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine or one of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, but that definition is currently being debated as some health experts argue that the threshold for \u201cfully vaccinated\u201d should include a booster dose for those who are eligible.Which is why, like it or not, a certain level of personal risk assessment is necessary for all of us, for the foreseeable future. Guidelines are just that \u2013 guidelines. Adhering to them doesn\u2019t guarantee protection, nor does it guarantee that others will adhere to them, too. It\u2019s important to consider your crowd and what you know of them (and are willing to ask of them) before making any decisions in the coming days and weeks.Why I cried when I found out I had CovidThose who have been boosted and who don\u2019t come into contact with at-risk populations may choose to consider only situations where others will be vaccinated, or, in cases of public gatherings, where others will be required to present proof of vaccination or a negative test result, to wear masks \u2013 or some combination of the three.Those who have not been vaccinated or boosted should do so at the earliest opportunity. For them, as well as for those who come into regular contact with high-risk individuals, it\u2019s worth staying home, given the highly contagious nature of Omicron.Of course, preventing further spread requires not only personal risk assessment but also self-enforcement. Plenty of people will not follow guidelines, either at private gatherings or at venues that maintain loose rules or allow patrons to skirt them. Stricter government oversight is not likely to be the answer. In many instances, it is difficult or even impossible to enforce the rules, and typically those who are unvaccinated because of a rejection of government mandates seem more likely to disregard those rules.One risk, meanwhile, of imposing new, harsher restrictions \u2013 such as testing requirements, or redefining \u201cfully vaccinated\u201d \u2013 is that these restrictions could incite backlash (or, at least, some apathy) among Americans who haveand are. The CDC\u2019s recent decision to cut the isolation timeline from 10 days down to five, if asymptomatic, followed by another five days of masking around others, has already inspired criticism and worry among many that the guidelines don\u2019t go far enough without a negative test confirmation. In an interview with CNN, Dr. Rochelle Walensky, the director of the CDC,\u201csome science has demonstrated less than a third of people are isolating when they need to.\u201dAnd so, as we enter the third year of the pandemic, it\u2019s increasingly up to every individual to assess their own risk.This may, at times, feel even more stressful than being told what to do \u2013 by the government, health experts or anyone else \u2013 especially when there\u2019s no real answer as to when this crisis will end.Four steps to prepare for the next pandemicBut that\u2019s precisely why determining what risks you\u2019re able and willing to take given the circumstances of your own life and those around you, is crucial. If any level of risk-taking starts to raise your anxiety, the benefits of going out or socializing may not be worth it. If it\u2019s difficult to see certain friends whose opinions differ, don\u2019t force it. Remember, too, that alcohol can often fuel confrontation or anxiety \u2013 or that anxiety can lead to over-indulging. If you know this is you, perhaps sit this holiday out. In other words, know your limits.What\u2019s most important is knowing in advance where your convictions, and your priorities, lie. This may not help you feel less stressed out or exhausted by the endless decision making and uncertainty that defines these days, but it will help you feel more at peace with whatever decision you make \u2013 even if others are not doing the same. It\u2019s true that, by now, we\u2019ve all spent enough time in some state of isolation or semi-isolation. But the current surge won\u2019t last forever.Until then, the best practice may be trying your best to embrace uncertainty \u2013 to, in the, become \u201ccomfortable with not knowing.\u201d Looking for balance may be best for most of us \u2013 to say no, perhaps, to indoor dining or a night out at a bar but yes to a walk outside with a friend. And know that you\u2019re doing your best to keep yourself safe but that, unfortunately, as in the rest of life, there are no guarantees.Community responsibility \u2013 including compassion and care for others\u2019 well-being, even at one\u2019s own expense \u2013 is something we can encourage but certainly not enforce. This New Year\u2019s and beyond, consider behaving in such a way that looks at the bigger picture \u2013 not because the government or even individual businesses are forcing you to (or, conversely, not forcing you to) but, rather, because this pandemic has been difficult for us all. Millions around the world have died, and nearly all have struggled in some way.Depending on who you are, where you live, the health care you have access to, and how healthy or well-off you are, you may not die or even get all that ill if you contract Covid. But someone else you come into contact with \u2013 at your local grocery store, on your street, in your family \u2013 might. The answer this weekend and going forward isn\u2019t in \u201cmaking\u201d people have empathy and compassion and community awareness. It\u2019s asking yourself to extend that compassion \u2013 not just for others, but for yourself as well."

View moreon CNN.If Democrats lose the US House of Representatives in this fall\u2019s midterm elections, 2023 is going to be rough \u2013 not just for liberals, but for American democracy and the country\u2019s overall stability.House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, a Republican from California, has alreadyto remove three prominent Democrats \u2013 Eric Swalwell, Adam Schiff and Ilhan Omar \u2013 from important committee assignments, simply \u2013 it seems \u2013  as vengeance.\u201cThe Democrats have created a new thing where they\u2019re picking and choosing who could be on committee. Never in the history have you had the majority tell the minority who could be on committee,\u201d McCarthythe right-wing Breitbart News.This would be a radical move under just about any circumstance, but it\u2019s coming at a critical moment, when American democracy is at its most fragile in generations. One party is seeking toour democratic system of governance and the institutions and norms that enable it. Another has steadily sought tothem.This latest threat is one more warning sign: The GOP is on the path to become an antidemocratic party. We miss that fact at our nation\u2019s peril.My grandfather taught me this crucial life lessonMcCarthy\u2019s threat is in retaliation for Democrats removing two Republican members of Congress, Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia and Paul Gosar of Arizona, from their committees, after Greene and Gosar made a series of inflammatory and disturbing comments that demonstrated their general unfitness for office.Gosaran anime video online that showed him attacking President Joe Biden with a sword and appearing to murder his colleague, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York. Greene\u2019s forays into violent and conspiratorial rhetoric are too numerousin their entirety, but they include lending credence to the QAnon conspiracy that promulgates the theory that Democratsto a child sex ring (she has sinceherself from QAnon); making several anti-Semitic comments,comparing Covid-19 vaccination requirements to Nazism (which she later apologized for) andCalifornia wildfires on Jewish space lasers; and indicating her support for executing several prominent Democrats before even running for Congress (in a, Greene said, \u201cOver the years, I\u2019ve had teams of people manage my pages\u2026 Some did not represent my views. Especially the ones that CNN is about to spread across the internet.\u201d).In a saner democracy, comments like Gosar\u2019s and Greene\u2019s would make them personas non grata within their party. Instead, GOP leadership has, for the most part, madeof their comments and then continuedthem. McCarthy, for example,that Greene\u2019s comments \u201cdo not represent the values or beliefs of the House Republican Conference\u201d and claimed to \u201ccondemn those comments unequivocally.\u201d But while he was happy to pay lip service to the concept of condemnation, heto actually do anything about Greene or Gosar and objected to the bipartisan move to strip them of their committee assignments.Why Congress had to take a stand on Paul Gosar's videoAnd now, instead of simply letting those chips fall, he\u2019s seeking vengeance on Democrats who have not done anything comparable to Greene or Gosar \u2013 and have certainly not suggested they support violence against their colleagues.It\u2019s not just McCarthy and his threats of retaliatory power-grabbing that signal the GOP\u2019s demise into antidemocratic darkness. A great many Republican elected officials haveon the Big Lie that former President Donald Trump won the 2020 election; 147 of them votedthe results of a free and fair election, simply because their guy lost.Some Republican members of Congress havethe events of Jan. 6. They have faced no consequences from their party, and some are now running for reelection, despite the fact that the 14th Amendment to the US Constitutionthat no one \u201cwho, having previously taken an oath, as a member of Congress \u2026 to support the constitution of the United States, shall have engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the same.\u201dSome Democrats and voters are finally saying, \u201cenough.\u201d In North Carolina, a group of voters are requesting that Rep. Madison Cawthornfrom running for his connection to the insurrection. Cawthorn spoke to the crowd gathered in Washington, DC on Jan. 6, claiming that Trump had really won the election, after having tweeted \u201cit\u2019s time to fight\u201d in the days prior.  Later that day, Trump supporters went on to storm the Capitol complex, where five people.Cawthorn hasn\u2019t learned his lesson and seems to have no remorse for his actions. \u201cWhen tyranny becomes law, rebellion becomes your duty,\u201d hein September, as he also warned of \u201cbloodshed\u201d because Trump didn\u2019t win. Those arrested for their insurrectionist acts on Jan. 6, he said, were \u201cpolitical prisoners\u201d and there should be plans to \u201ctry and bust them out.\u201d A spokesperson for the representativethis week that, \u201cover 245,000 patriots from western North Carolina elected Congressman Cawthorn to serve them in Washington.\u201dRepublican members of Congress are openly encouraging violence andto subvert American democracy.  Republicans could clean house and declare that no one who attempts to undermine a free and fair election \u2013 let alone the American democratic system itself \u2013 should serve in Congress with an R next to their name. But instead, the party\u2019s leaders are taking vengeful aim at Democrats with threats of stripping them from committees.This isn\u2019t an issue of partisan divide. It\u2019s a fundamental question of what America should be. And the behavior of many Republicans, including several of its leaders, suggests that the GOP\u2019s answer is something other than \u201ca free democratic nation.\u201d"

        "text": "Editor\u2019s Note:to get our weekly column as a newsletter. We\u2019re looking back at the strongest, smartestof the week from CNN and other outlets.In Christian tradition, January 6 is the feast of the Epiphany, which marks both an ending and beginning. It\u2019s the twelfth day after Christmas, and, if you observe, celebrates the revelation of divinity shown to the three Magi when they visit the human baby Jesus.The word \u201cepiphany\u201d \u2013 which the Oxford English Dictionary defines as a \u201cmanifestation\u201d or \u201cstriking appearance, especially an appearance of a divinity\u201d \u2013 also connotes more secular forms of incarnation. A sudden idea or unexpected perception, a breakthrough, an upending of the ordinary. Poet Mary Oliver, whose work some theologians cite in connection with moments of spiritual revelation, writes in an oft-quoted\u201cSometimes\u201d:This year, as it was in 2021, January 6 was something more than Epiphany, and will forever be marked as a wound in America\u2019s collective memory, but it\u2019s still worth asking what was being made manifest in the United States on this day a year ago, and what\u2019s appearing to us now. \u201cI woke up knowing it was going to be a difficult day, but I had no idea that it would take the harrowing turn that it did,\u201d recalled Rep., who described texting his wife, \u201cWhatever happens, I love you\u201d as a \u201cviolent mob of Trump supporters was descending on the US Capitol.\u201d When members of Congress returned that evening to finalize the election result,Allred, \u201cDemocracy held, but it showed dangerous signs of fracturing.\u201d, who was covering the \u201cStop the Steal\u201d rally in downtown Washington, DC and reflected on what she\u2019s learned in the year since, wrote in terms redolent of Oliver\u2019s \u201cinstructions for living a life\u201d when sheparallels between the day\u2019s violence and the unrest depicted in protests over busing in the year of America\u2019s bicentennial: \u201creally, it was over democracy: who is part of it; who is excluded; and who gets to tell its story.\u201dChideya, who has been reporting about extremism for many years, proposed steps journalism and civil society alike can take to avoid \u201cwatching democracy burn\u201d \u2013 stop treating extremists like an other, and most of all, \u201cbe prepared to live in psychic discomfort over the state of American democracy, and do so indefinitely. Just as we are learning to adapt to the pandemic, to the fatiguing array of choices we face under pain of death or illness, we can learn to adapt to an America where we have to face threats to democracy head-on.\u201dThose threats are chillingly real and continue to grow,, because while the insurrection at the US Capitol was a peak of contemporary White nationalism in America, it was also \u201ca dress rehearsal for what will likely come next.\u201dBergen connected the dots between a White nationalist past defined by racists like William Luther Pierce and Louis Beam and a present reflected in polls showing over three quarters of Republicans falsely believe Biden did not win the 2020 presidential election and one in three Americans \u201cendorses the view that violence against the government is sometimes justified.\u201dhow two opposing historical forces \u2013 reconstructionism and redemptionism \u2013 have defined American historical memory since the post-Civil War moment and still have the power to shape US democracy in 2022: \u201cthese competing worldviews continue, for better and worse, to forge our national identity. But they do not predetermine our destiny unless we let them.\u201dPresident Joe Biden\u2019s speech on the anniversary of January 6 signaled a stark shift in his approach to the nation\u2019s ongoing crisis of democracy,. Jabbing at former President Donald Trump for his role in setting the stage for the insurrection \u2013 mentioning him 16 times without uttering his name \u2013 Biden\u2019s \u201cwords and delivery were quite a contrast from the Biden whose speeches, especially those dealing with democracy and the future of the nation, have tended to emphasize national unity and reconciliation. The shift reflected a recognition that the insurrection of January 6 is not simply a part of the past, but a looming threat into the future.\u201dFormer Presidentin the New York Times: \u201cOur great nation now teeters on the brink of a widening abyss. Without immediate action, we are at genuine risk of civil conflict and losing our precious democracy.\u201d But where must America go from here?In the Wall Street Journal,his fellow Republicans to hold themselves accountable for the events of January 6 and asked them to answer the question: What would you have done if Democrats did this?The perils confronting American democracy now are the result of deeper forces, noted. Accountability for the events of January 6 goes hand in hand with a push for voting rights, Coates: \u201cIt would be foolish to investigate an insurrection without continuing parallel investigations by the Department of Justice into state laws that target minority voters by adopting laws with discriminatory features, that actively seek to disenfranchise them, and gerrymandered districts that dilute their voting power and strength.\u201d She emphasized the \u201cBig Lie\u201d that Trump was denied a victory through election fraud \u201cremains false, but the self-evident truth is that our democracy is under attack by those who keenly understand the power of the vote. It is not widespread voter fraud that they fear; it is widespread voter participation.\u201dThe political polarization of the last year and Congress\u2019s failures to implement reforms to protect democracy have made it all the more \u201curgent for Americans outside of government to redouble their efforts to safeguard democratic governance and the values that underwrite it,\u201d. She laid out four things ordinary Americans can do to support and protect democracy: Tell the truth about January 6, talk about values instead of norms, engage in local activism and invest in reviving civic life and institutions.After oral arguments Friday over federal Covid-19 vaccine mandates,observed the Supreme Court\u2019s conservative majority appeared ready to rule against the Biden administration. \u201cSeveral justices went out of their way to say they were not against vaccines, but they were against government mandates,\u201d. \u201cWhatever the reasons that ultimately justify the rulings, the most likely outcome for the country seemed clear: fewer required vaccinations and testing, likely leading to greater sickness and even more death.\u201dThe arguments and their outcome could also foreshadow the conservative majority\u2019s broader view of executive power,\u2013 \u201cthe ruling may provide a window into the court\u2019s thinking that may be instructive to lower courts and serve as a precursor of what will happen when the court is faced with the same or similar issue in the future.\u201dWhen her daughter \u2013 too young to be vaccinated \u2013 contracted Covid-19 after an outbreak in her pre-kindergarten classroom,and her husband \u201cspent a few sleepless nights fighting to bring her 103-degree fever down as our little warrior coughed and struggled with congestion.\u201d Thankfully, she recovered, butstressed Hossain, who \u201ccan\u2019t stop thinking about how, as a country, the US just can\u2019t seem to effectively prioritize the well-being of children\u201d when it comes to Covid policies or access to necessary resources like mental health support or affordable child care. \u201cThe kids are not OK,\u201d she insisted.Neither are the parents,\u2013 the confused Covid-19 messaging is exhausting, as is grappling with the difficult decision to send kids to school or not. Parents are flooded with anxiety, stoked by rapid Omicron spread, fuzzy guidance and bad actors in politics and at some right-wing media outlets who are exploiting the trauma. She concluded: \u201cIt\u2019s okay to demand better of our public health officials without calling into question their motives or the whole of science. We\u2019ll get through this if we can drown out the noise, ignore the nonsense and focus on the things we know have worked.\u201dOf the contentious question of schools,for the Washington Post: \u201cIt\u2019s wrong for politicians to stop the use of readily available mitigation measures such as masks. But it\u2019s equally wrong to argue that unless every protection is in place, schools cannot remain open.\u201dOn Tuesday, tennis star Novak Djokovic (who has not volunteered his vaccination status and has spoken out against the Covid-19 vaccine) announced tournament officials had granted him a medical exemption to play at the Australian Open, touching off a firestorm of international controversy.After traveling to Australia on a visa which, according to Prime Minister Scott Morrison, does not permit medical exemptions for the unvaccinated, Djokovic remained at the airport and, as, \u201cis now a man in limbo, staying in a hotel used as an immigration detention center, and which has since become a magnet for protesters of all stripes \u2013 from Djokovic supports to refugee advocates.\u201dThe hearing concerning his appeal of the visa cancellation has been adjourned until Monday, said Myles, so Djokovic remains a man in limbo for now, and a man who\u2019s \u201cnever been particularly good at reading the room\u201d for a good while longer than that. \u201cIn the end, Djokovic\u2019s hubris hasn\u2019t helped. But no one\u201d \u2013 not the various levels of government, not tennis leadership \u2013 \u201ccomes out of this looking good,\u201d observed Myles, especially to an Australian fan base which has suffered through some of the harshest lockdowns in the world and has a culturally ingrained sense of fair play. Documents published on Saturday by Australia\u2019s Federal Circuit Court showed Djokovic was granted a medical exemption to compete after recently recovering from Covid-19.After months of testimony and seven days of deliberations, a jury found Theranos CEO Elizabeth Holmes guilty on four charges of defrauding investors and acquitted her of four other charges. The jury failed to reach a verdict of three additional charges. Overall, this result is still a \u201cstark rebuke of the defense, which attempted to portray Holmes as a visionary leader who fell victim to subordinates who misled her and investors who misunderstood her\u201dfor CNN Business Perspectives.The verdict also constituted a \u201cwelcome rejection of the dubious gender stereotypes\u201d the defense \u201crolled out in an effort to secure her acquittal,\u201dfor Slate. \u201cBy arguing that Holmes, whose company was once worth billions, was merely a victim working under the direction of her male business partner, the defense advanced a perspective that risked undermining the fragile gains women have made in tech and business,\u201d Stemple wrote.\u201cWith a life that spanned nearly a century \u2014 including more than seven decades in the TV business \u2014 it\u2019s impossible to adequately represent Betty White\u2019s legacy in a single tribute. And since her death at the age of 99 on December 31 many remembrances have focused on her iconic work as an actor and her award-winning performances,\u201d. \u201cBut the perpetually sweet (occasionally foul-mouthed) grande dame of television had a massive and often overlooked influence on American culture off-camera as well.\u201dIn addition to her life as \u201cTV\u2019s original trailblazing feminist\u201d (co-founding a production company in 1952 and becoming the first woman to produce a national television show), White was a vocal supporter and advocate for civil and human rights for decades and was outspoken (in interviews as early as the 1950s) in her efforts to \u201cnormalize and destigmatize the idea that a woman didn\u2019t have to meet a man, get pregnant and raise a family in order to be considered successful\u2026. Intentional or accidental, White\u2019s progressive approach has left a visible impact on both the entertainment industry and American culture at large.\u201dfor CNN Business Perspectives:Legendary actor and pioneer Sidney Poitier, who died Friday at 94, \u201clived long enough not only to reap full and power acclaim for his groundbreaking body of work,\u201d, \u201cbut also to witness wave after wave of Black actors, actresses, writers, directors and craftspeople following the path he helped clear for them.\u201dAs far as Black male film stars go, Seymour noted, \u201cWithout Sir Sidney Poitier, there is no Billy Dee Williams, Denzel Washington, Morgan Freeman, Eddie Murphy, Forest Whitaker, Michael B. Jordan or, for that matter, that other Michael Jordan, whose ability to parlay his fearsome basketball skills into a cross-cultural, multimedia hyphenate was at least partly enabled by Poitier, who made it safe for Black culture heroes in all kinds of endeavors to connect with Whites as well as other Blacks.\u201dAfter his last film in 2001, Poitier received another Oscar for lifetime achievement, and, as Seymour pointed out, \u201cHe had reached the kind of iconic stature once reserved solely for such male icons as John Wayne, James Cagney and Cary Grant. That same night, Poitier got to watch both Denzel Washington and Halle Berry receive lead acting Academy Awards, with Berry being the first Black actress to receive the award. You can\u2019t say for certain, but you have to believe that Poitier believed those latter two events represented a greater, more significant recognition of his long quest for acceptance and achievement than another gold statuette.\u201d"

        "text": "Editor\u2019s Note:Colin Allred is a Democratic representative from Texas\u2019 32nd congressional district. The views expressed in this commentary are his own. Viewon CNN.On January 6, I woke up knowing it was going to be a difficult day, but I had no idea that it would take the harrowing turn that it did.In fact, I was actually somewhat optimistic when the day began. Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock, hours before, hadin Georgia, giving Democrats control of the Senate. Weeks earlier in November, inandturnout in the 2020 presidential election had been historic \u2013 with people of all backgrounds and political persuasions making their voices heard despiteand.Then that day, as expected, President Donald Trump\u2019s allies Rep. Paul Gosar of Arizona and Sen. Ted Cruz of Texasto the Arizona results \u2013 attempting to prop up the lie that the 2020 election was stolen.That\u2019s when I started getting texts from friends and family asking where I was, and if I was safe. A violent mob of Trump supporters was descending on the US Capitol. I texted my wife, \u201cWhatever happens, I love you.\u201d I was prepared for the worst.Many people don\u2019t know just how close we came to a more catastrophic event with even further loss of life. Thanks to the bravery of US Capitol Police and DC Metro Police, my colleagues and I were safely evacuated. I will be forever grateful for the service of these officers.I believe that the most important thing that happened that day is not a failed attempt to reject the results of a free, fair and secure election, but Congress acting in ato reaffirm our democracy later that night. Democracy held, but it showed dangerous signs of fracturing.What the January 6 report means for the future of democracyAs a member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, I have spoken with representatives from allied nations since that day. As the world watched the attempted coup, many wondered whether democracy in the US would survive.The events of January 6 fit into a broaderacross the world, which is attempting to undermine and weaken western democracies. Powerful autocracies like Russia and China continue toon democratic movements at home and to export anti-democratic propaganda and technology abroad, while former secular democracies like Hungary, Turkey and Poland continue to experienceAnd now the US joins that list of democracies in decline, according to European think tank.We\u2019ve seen this before. In the 1920s, 1930s and 1940s, authoritarian movementsin the world, from Germany to Italy, Spain to Japan \u2013 and it was the United States which helped to lead the world in an effort to defeat these movements.Once again, the United States must lead the way out of this new era of authoritarianism.The battle that will define America in 2022 began in 1865To Democrats, guaranteeing voting rights is a critical part of safeguarding democracy. However, we also recognize that our efforts to do so will not succeed without support from Republicans and Independents alike.2022 is the year that the pro-democracy forces that believe in this country \u2013 regardless of party affiliation \u2013 must come together to act. Like, a Republican member of the January 6 House select committee, other Republicans must be willing to reject Trump\u2019s toxic brand of politics and stand up for democratic principles.Accountability for January 6, though important, isn\u2019t enough. As we saw in Texas and other states Republican-controlled legislatures wereto go along with the \u201cBig Lie\u201d and make it harder for many Americans to cast their ballot.As former President George W. Bushin a September speech marking the 20th anniversary of the 9/11 terrorist attacks, \u201cThere is little cultural overlap between violent extremists abroad and those at home. But in their disdain for pluralism, in their disregard for human life, in their determination to defile national symbols, they are children of the same foul spirit, and it is our duty to confront them.\u201dIt was under Bush that the Voting Rights Act was lastin 2006 withbipartisan approval in the House and Senate.That legacy of bipartisan support for democracy is one crucial reason why the Senate needs to pass thewhich will end partisan gerrymandering, secure our elections and protect voting rights. The House is ready to act, as we did with thelast summer. Despite hurdles within the Senate to changing the filibuster, the Senate must use any and all options it can to get this done. This bill is too important to let an arcane Senate rule stop the work we need to do.Our democracy is at stake. Let\u2019s fight to protect it, together."

Read moreon CNN.Last week, the Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP)that it will\u2014finally\u2014keep a key justice reform promise made in 2018\u2019s First Step Act.Thursday\u2019s release of a new rule interpreting the act opened the door to community reintegration and family reunification forof all the people in federal custody, according to data from the Department of Justice.For a long time, under Donald Trump\u2019s administration, the BOP seemed to slow-walk and even undercut the First Step Act\u2019s reforms, resulting in a patchy and unjust application.Inmate released under new justice reform law accused of murderWe know this personally. One of us (Danya Perry, along with the firm she co-founded, Perry Guha LLP) is a lawyer whoto court over its refusal to quickly and properly implement the First Step Act\u2014and won. Another (Michael Cohen) was a federal inmate who took the BOP on by himself, making the same arguments that prevailed in Danya\u2019s case\u2014and lost.Thepassed withand wasby then-President Donald Trump on December 21, 2018. Ita suite of modest but meaningful reforms to the federal criminal legal system, whereare in post-conviction custody. The Act\u2019s reforms ranged fromracially discriminatory sentences for certain qualifying crack cocaine convictions to expanding a \u201c\u201d that allows some people convicted of drug offenses to be sentenced below the mandatory minimum.And, importantly, the act set up the \u201cTime Credit\u201d program, allowing people in custody who have been convicted of nonviolent offenses to earn up to 15 days of credit for every 30 days of participation in recidivism reduction programs or \u201cproductive activities\u201d like prison jobs. Time credits don\u2019t shorten your sentence, but they can make youfor earlier transfer to a halfway house, home confinement or supervised release. That\u2019s a big deal. BOPthat about half of all people in federal custody\u2014tens of thousands of people\u2014are eligible to earn those credits and get an early start on reintegration and family reunification.One problem was that the act never defined how much programming a person in custody must complete in order to earn a \u201cday\u201d of participation. And it wasn\u2019t 100% clear about when the Time Credit program actually was to begin.The act left those things to the BOP\u2014part of the Department of Justice\u2014to work out. And the BOP\u2019s first draft of a rule\u2014known in administrative law lingo as a \u201cproposed rule\u201d\u2014released onin the waning days of the Trump administration, seemed to set people up to fail.The one issue that could bring Democrats and Republicans togetherThe proposed rule required people in custody to complete eight full hours of programming in a day in order to earn a day\u2019s worth of credit\u2014even though, as the act\u2019s bipartisan authors pointed out in a, \u201cBOP programs do not run for eight hours per day.\u201d And it refused to give credit for programming completed before January 15, 2022\u2014even though untold numbers of people in custody worked countless hours in response to the act\u2019s promise.The proposed rule wasn\u2019t law, of course. Rules are proposed before they\u2019re finalized, to give affected people a chance to comment and push back.And we did push back. In Goodman v. Ortiz, Perry Guha represented a client, who had earned enough Time Credit for immediate release, but whom the BOP refused to transfer to a halfway house or home confinement. A federal judge in the district of New Jerseythe petition and ordered the BOP to follow the act and give the petitioner the credit that he\u2019d earned, which resulted in his release to a halfway house. Michael, meanwhile, was held in a different jurisdiction. And when he applied for relief from a different federal court, he didn\u2019t get it\u2014despite having qualified in the same way as Goodman. Those are the kinds of unequal, arbitrary results you get when the law isn\u2019t clear or evenly applied.But that won\u2019t happen going forward. The Biden administration final rule,, fixed both of those problems with the Trump administration\u2019s first draft. And now, as the DOJ announced,in custody will be eligible for release\u2014including some who will be released \u201c.\u201dGoodman v. Ortiz helped to establish that Congress, in passing the act, intended the BOP to move quickly to give out Time Credits. And the BOP admirably, listened to the court\u2019s ruling,in explaining why its new rule would grant credits for programming completed from December 18, 2018 onwards.That\u2019s only fair: When the First Step Act passed, a lot of people in custody began working hard for Time Credits. They should be given what they had been promised and what they had earned. We can\u2019t ask people to pay a debt to society while society refuses to make good on its promises to them.The BOP also listened to the voices ofand to the act\u2019sin allowing up to 15 days of credit for every 30 day period of program participation\u2014no matter how many hours per day the program runs. Again, that\u2019s only fair. People in custody don\u2019t decide how many hours of programming the BOP offers and they shouldn\u2019t be penalized for the BOP\u2019s programming decisions.Let\u2019s be clear: There is still a lot of work to be done. There arethat the BOP isenough high-quality programs to help support people in prison, particularly during the pandemic.While unquestionably impactful, the act was indeed only a \u201cfirst step\u201d towards broader changes that are desperately needed to reduce our cruel and counterproductive overreliance on incarceration. And even this welcome development does not erase the needless suffering of too many people, while the BOP pushed back against inmates seeking time credit anda rule that cut against Congress\u2019 intent.But, after years of frustration, this is an unmistakable win for incarcerated people and their families, for advocates and for a country that is still struggling to be rehabilitated from its chronic addiction to incarceration."

Viewon CNN.A year after Donald Trump left the White House and with the 2022 midterms looming, much of the Republican Party has its sights on what, and who, comes next. Though Trump is still very much in the picture \u2013 hishad strong back-on-the-campaign-trail vibes \u2013 two Republican governors (and the states they represent) have emerged as possible answers to these GOP questions: Virginia\u2019s Glenn Youngkin and Florida\u2019s Ron DeSantis.But as debates continue about the party\u2019s post-Trump future, it will be critical to see past conventional political labels \u2013 lest they conceal the true threats imperiling American democracy.Youngkin, who won in a state that\u2019s been reliably blue in recent years, has emerged as the party\u2019s, a Republican who kept Trump at arms\u2019 length during his campaign and avoided talking about issues like abortion and guns. DeSantis, on the other hand, has positioned himself as Trump\u2019s, picking up Trump\u2019s trigger-the-libs patois and his conspiracy-driven grievance politics.Not that the Trump mimicry has earned DeSantis the former president\u2019s favor. In the past few weeks,have been taking potshots at each other, with Trump indirectly calling DeSantis \u201cgutless\u201d for refusing to say he got the booster, and DeSantis suggesting Trump botched the early pandemic response.Yet this framing of the two men as representing two divergent paths forward for the GOP misses the mark. For one, it mistakes rhetoric for substance: on core issues, there is very little daylight between Youngkin and DeSantis. And evaluating Republican candidates based on how they compare to Trump overlooks the bigger picture. Namely, regardless of how the candidates sound, they are all part of the same project: empowering a distinctly anti-democratic Republican Party.School superintendent says his district won't comply with Republican governor's executive order on masksThe tendency to see the Republican Party as a body organized by a split between moderates and conservatives goes back decades. In the 1960s and 1970s, the moderate-conservative rift described a set of substantial ideological differences between prominent Republican officeholders.Moderates like New York Gov. Nelson Rockefeller and Michigan Gov. George Romney supported robust social safety-net programs, feminism and advances in civil rights. Conservatives like Sen. Barry Goldwater wanted to dramatically roll back the federal government\u2019s role in the economy and in civil rights protections. For more than a decade those fights roiled the party, but by the late 1970s, the conservatives had won a decisive victory, cemented in 1980 by the election of Ronald Reagan.By the 1990s, the party had moved dramatically to the right, and the divisions were no longer about ideology but about absolutism. After President George H. W. Bush failed to live up to his \u201cno new taxes\u201d pledge, which doomed him within the increasingly conservative Republican Party, the appetite for compromise shrank dramatically. House Speaker Newt Gingrich, who rose to power on a wave of uncompromising conservatism, was soon outflanked on his right by even more absolutist members, who constantly attacked him for working with President Bill Clinton on anything.None of this made Gingrich a moderate, any more than the Sen. John McCain\u2019s 2017 vote against repealing the Affordable Care Act made him one. But even as the Republican caucus moved further and further right, the labels \u201cmoderate\u201d and \u201cconservative\u201d shifted with it, concealing the party\u2019s growing radicalism.Ron DeSantis could be a threat to Trump's campaign. Here's whyThat same language is being used to describe the future directions for the Republican Party: the moderate path of Youngkin versus the more conservative path of DeSantis. Youngkin has been widely praised for finding a way to appeal to the White suburbanites turned off by Trump\u2019s coarseness, putting together a coalition that won in a state that has rapidly turned blue in recent years (and that Biden won).DeSantis, meanwhile, governs in a once-swing,, and his rallies have the sort of energy \u2013 raw and rowdy \u2013 that used to accompany Trump\u2019s. That divergence has left some wondering if voters turn away from Trump and choose more Youngkins, or double down and become the party of DeSantis?But these frameworks \u2013 moderate or conservative, Trump-like or Trump-avoidant \u2013 obscure much more than they reveal. First, there is no political substance to the moderate/conservative divide anymore. Youngkin is no moderate. On his first day in office, he issued an executive order. Though he stopped talking about abortion during the general election, he sat 20 weeks and pledged to \u201cgo on offense\u201d on the issue once elected. And while he acknowledges Joe Biden\u2019s legitimacy as president, he has also played into the big lie about the 2020 election,vote audits in Virginia, where Biden won handily.Trump about GOP senator: 'I will never endorse this jerk again'He plays culture war with Covid and education rather than abortion and guns, but his policy stances on all those issues are deeply conservative. If there is a moderate in today\u2019s Republican Party \u2013 and it\u2019s not clear there is \u2013 they do not represent its future.Likewise, the focus on how similar candidates are to Trump centers almost entirely on personality: how crass and outrageous and brazenly untruthful a candidate can be. Trump certainly opened the door for a new level of shamelessness and conspiracy in politics, and there are plenty of imitators eager to do the same. DeSantis has refined the act some, dog-whistling his outrageousness withof the chant \u201cLet\u2019s Go Brandon\u201d (a coded way of saying \u201cf*** Joe Biden\u201d).Yet while those comparisons with Trump are interesting, they simply aren\u2019t that important. DeSantis and Youngkin both have worked to adapt to Trumpism, to find ways to tap into the excitement Trump arouses in their own way, something nearly every Republican candidate will do in the next few election cycles. But the real question we should be using to assess these candidates is not the moderation of their tone or their relationship to Trump \u2013 it\u2019s their dedication to democracy.In Republican politics these days, that dedication is increasingly rare. Calls for election audits, attempts to strip power from voters, threats of future insurrections \u2013 all have been defining features of Republican politics in the past year since Trump left office. Which is why, when it comes to discussions of the future of the Republican Party and who might lead it after Trump, the main question we should all be asking is about the candidate\u2019s relationship to democracy. Are they actively working to undermine it? Are they playing along with the baroque schemes and conspiracies of the antidemocratic right? Are they speaking out forcefully against the insurrection and efforts to undermine future elections?Where Republicans land on those questions will determine not only the future of the Republican Party, but the future of the republic itself."

He is the co-chair of national organisation,, the Chancellor of the, and the former Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Justice Commissioner at the Australian Human Rights Commission. The views expressed in this commentary are his own. Read moreJanuary 26 is, by coincidence, a significant date in the national calendars of two countries, with an important difference.In India, January 26 marks Republic Day, and celebrates the date when the constitution of India came into effect in 1950. In short: official independence.In Australia, January 26 marks the daysailed into what is now called Sydney Harbour and established a penal colony on the land of the Eora, the Aboriginal people of the area. This act was without permission, agreement or treaty. It set in motion events the Indigenous peoples of this country \u2013 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples \u2013 are still reeling from today. In short: invasion.I could not think of a starker contrast than these two national \u201ccelebrations.\u201dNot only does January 26 mark the day the dispossession of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples began, it sets up European invasion as an important source of Australian identity and pride. In doing so, it ignores more thanAs we approach the end of January 2022, many Australians are once again questioning why this date continues to be celebrated.Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people have been challenging the date since at least January 26, 1938 when, as a culmination of years of work by the Australian Aborigines League (AAL) and the Aborigines Progressive Association (APA), the first Day of Mourning was held.On this day, crowds gathered in Sydney to celebrate the 150th anniversary of the arrival of Europeans in Australia. Afterwards, hundreds of Aboriginal people and their supporters took part in ain mourning of the devastating impact of colonization, theinclude the theft and destruction of lands and cultures; decimation of populations by disease and massacres; destruction of families and kinship; ongoing discrimination; and economic, political and social exclusion.Indeed, the 1938 protest was \u201cagainst the callous treatment of our people by the white men during the past 150 years,\u201d Day of Mourning organizer, Jack Patten,Since then, January 26 has been symbolic for many Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples as a lightning rod for protest and awareness raising.This will be a particularly significant year, as 2022 marks 50 years since the Aboriginal Tent Embassy was established in the nation\u2019s capital, Canberra, on January 26, 1972. It was on this day that four Aboriginal men with a beach umbrella \u2013 and the weight of history behind them \u2013 set up on the lawns in front of the then-Australian Parliament House to bring Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander land and justice back to the forefront of national debate.The term \u201cembassy\u201d was used to bring attention to the fact Aboriginal people had never ceded sovereignty nor engaged in any treaty process with the British Crown. To this day, the Embassy remains a site of protest for Indigenous land rights, sovereignty, and self-determination.In the intervening decades, the language we use to talk about January 26 has changed hugely. For at least the past 30 years, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples have reclaimed the day as \u201cInvasion Day\u201d or \u201cSurvival Day\u201d to highlight, promote and share the ongoing culture and survival of First Nations cultures through marches, protests, festivals, vigils, and memorials.While some argue that a push to change the date is divisive, the intent is actually to bring us closer together.Reconciliation is about fostering better relationships so that we can build a just, equitable and more unified tomorrow. Reconciliation must be based on a foundation of trust, truth and honesty regarding our past. Expecting Aboriginal and Torres Strait Island Peoples to ignore or look past the significance of Australia Day and what it has meant for them is simply inconsistent with reconciliation.To recognize and heal, action must be taken and changes made. A date change is as necessary as it is straightforward. So straightforward, in fact, we\u2019ve done it several times in the past. Over the last century, there have beenincluding onas part of World War I fundraising efforts. It wasn\u2019t until 1994 that January 26 became a national public holiday.While we cannot change history, we must address how we deal with this day in a respectful way. Australia is not alone in this. We watch with interest as Columbus Day, a day that celebrates the arrival of Christopher Columbus in the Americas, is now being negotiated in the United States. A growing number of US states and cities have replaced Columbus Day with Indigenous Peoples Day, a holiday meant to honor the culture and history of the people living in the Americas both before and after Columbus\u2019 arrival.In mainstream Australia, we\u2019ve also seen this change unfolding. A growing number of local councils recognize January 26 is not a national holiday all Australians can celebrate. Companies are offering employees flexibility regarding working on January 26. And it doesn\u2019t get more mainstream than when Cricket Australia removed the words, \u201cAustralia Day,\u201d from branding cricket matches on that day.Reconciliation Australia\u2019s bi-annualshows these actions mirror changing community attitudes, with support for moving the date continuing to grow. The barometer also shows close to 90% of the general  community understand we must tell and accept the truth of our history to move forward.More than 230 years after the first fleet\u2019s arrival, the ongoing impact of the events of January 26, 1788, can be seen and felt in Australia across many fronts, includingof First Nations peoples; the growingin out-of-home care; thefor Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians, and the non-resolution of issues of sovereignty, land and representation.No treaty was ever signed with Australia\u2019s Indigenous peoples; no recognition ever given to our existence. January 26 cannot serve as a unifying date; not now or in the future, as more and more Australians in the wider community come to understand and respond to the truth of our history.This year, we are once again asking all Australians to have brave conversations with family, friends and colleagues about how we celebrate January 26, and to reflect on the benefits of a new date for a truly unifying national day of reflection and celebration."

        "text": "Editor\u2019s Note:On Sunday at 9 p.m. ET, CNN will air Fareed Zakaria\u2019s latest special report, \u201cThe Fight to Save American Democracy,\u201d which examines the threat to American elections after January 6, 2021, and the possibility of another crisis in 2024. This piece draws on similar themes as the author\u2019s. View moreat CNN.On the anniversary of January 6, as we think about the future of American democracy, it\u2019s useful to look around the world at what scholars have called a \u201cdemocratic recession.\u201d From Hungary to Poland to Turkey to India, democratic norms, values and institutions are under stress.And it\u2019s not just happening in fledgling democracies. Consider, for example, modern Germany. After its hellish descent into tyranny in the 1930s and 1940s, Germany came out of war defeated and destroyed but then re-emerged and recreated itself. Today it appears to be an almost preternaturally stable democracy. Angela Merkel served solidly for 16 years as Chancellor, and she has been succeeded by her former finance minister, another moderate. The country\u2019s policies seem to have shifted in only marginal ways. The populist right is marginal and ineffective.But behind that calm lie more turbulent currents. As, for decades, Germany\u2019s two main political parties taken together usually got around 90% of the vote. But they got just under 50% in the 2021 federal election.New parties and new movements are emerging.Pildes calls this \u201cpolitical fragmentation,\u201d and it\u2019s happening across the Western world. France\u2019s socialist party \u2013 one of Europe\u2019s most successful \u2013 is now a shadow of its former self. Spain has had to hold four elections in four years to arrive at a workable coalition. Ever since 2018 ushered in the right-wing populists, Italian politics has been in turmoil, saved now by a technocratic government headed by Prime Minister Mario Draghi. Even the Netherlands took a record 225 days to form a coalition government in 2017.A year after the insurrection, Republicans around the country still promote Trump's election liesWhy is this happening? Some of the reasons are familiar. An age of rapid technological change, accelerating globalization and increasing ethnic diversity have created great anxieties. These anxieties then lead to distrust in traditional institutions and established parties. New figures crash onto the political scene, some of whom peddle fear and offer simple solutions to get rid of all this new complexity and take the country back, back to when times were more stable, back to when the country was great (in the misty, often mistaken memory).But why does American democracy feel more threatened than, say, French or Spanish democracy?In those countries, the new radical forces do not seem as determined to attack the core of the political system. First, it is worth noting that in Europe, the order being attacked is the European Union, which is in fact under considerable strain. One of its three largest economies, Great Britain, has exited the union. Others, like Poland and Hungary, are seeking to weaken it from within.But all that said, America does feel especially under stress as it approaches its next presidential election. If the scenarios outlined in my special report, \u201cThe Fight to Save American Democracy,\u201d come true \u2013 Trump runs, wins the nomination, and it\u2019s a close election \u2013 we will almost certainly face a constitutional crisis. More worrying, given the changes to election procedures, we will likely face this kind of contestation after every close election in America moving forward. The basic legitimacy of the American electoral system has been eroded. Republicans in particular have embraced a big lie: that American elections are filled with fraud.It may be that we have exposed a flaw in the founders\u2019 Constitution. They believed that to create a political system, you did not need to ensure that people acted virtuously. \u201cIf men were angels,\u201d James Madison famously wrote, \u201cno government would be necessary.\u201d Ambition would be made to counteract ambition \u2013 and this system of checks and balances would preserve liberty and democracy.Fears of extremist violence go 'well beyond' January 6 anniversaryBut can a system work without human beings acting responsibly, even virtuously? One branch of government, Congress, is supposed to check the other. But today, for Republicans party politics trumps institutional loyalty. The real scandal of January 6 is not what happened outside the Capitol alone, it\u2019s what happened inside when a majority of House Republicans voted to overturn the valid results of a presidential election simply to curry favor with then-President Donald Trump. It is that vote, not the violence, that almost broke the American system.We often hear that, unlike in fledgling democracies, America\u2019s institutions are strong. But, as Ralph Waldo Emerson said, \u201cAn institution is the lengthened shadow of one man.\u201d If people abuse them, attack them, disregard them, they will slowly collapse.And so all our efforts must be devoted to making people act virtuously. In particular, Republicans must come to realize that they can and should disagree with Democrats vigorously on taxes, regulation, inflation, the environment \u2013 whatever they want. But now they must come together with those same Democrats to preserve a credible and legitimate political system.For all of us, that is the most important political issue right now, not your views on Iran or green subsidies. Those differences can wait. Let\u2019s first save American democracy."

        "text": "Editor\u2019s Note:is a writer, editor and academic based in London, with a focus on food and drink, she explores issues around identity, equality and sustainability. She is editor in chief ofandand co-host of the podcastThe views expressed in this commentary are her own. Viewon CNN.Celebrity chef Jamie Oliver\u2019s recentin which he said he has \u201cteams of cultural appropriation specialists\u201d to make sure he doesn\u2019t get into hot water over his recipes, has caused a stir \u2013 as the topic of cultural appropriation always does.The public reaction was swift. We saw the usual, tired responses throwing around the word \u201cwoke,\u201d as if it is an army of people flying a woke banner, hellbent on destruction. There was anabout \u201cHOW SICKENING THAT WE HAVE TO DO THIS IN OUR COUNTRY.\u201d This waselsewhere that a grown man, an expert in his field, would need to be monitored for being a bit insensitive. And that he required not one, but teams, plural, to stop him from calling a recipe(as he did in 2012).Jamie Oliver is two things: a person, but also a business. What is pervasive though, and probably the key to why his comments got such a huge response, is this idea that he is an individual that is doing it all. It is an identity that is performed with precision in(\u201cI still get the sense of a one-man Jamie juggernaut,\u201d writes interviewer Laura Pullman).Who is Jamie Oliver? The man, the myth, the well-oiled machine of a cookbook and recipe empire. Like every generation since the release of The Naked Chef, I went off to university with a Jamie Oliver cookbook under my arm. I have a few of his books and find them useful \u2013 reliable recipes (tried by a team of recipe testers), enticing photos (created by a team of photographers and stylists), easy to navigate instructions (honed by a team of designers and editors).There are,andon his website alone. Even a deep love for Sunday lunch could not come up with that many variations without some help. And so, like any business that creates content, there will be editors, fact-checkers and researchers. These teams of \u201ccultural appropriation specialists\u201d are just another editorial team. The Jamie Oliver empire is run by many.Jamie Oliver says he's hired cultural appropriation specialists to advise on cookbooksJamie Oliver, the brand, is the everyday lad who grew up in front of the nation\u2019s eyes \u2013 from carefree Vespa riding to tackling school lunches and sugar in drinks. The concept that he has a team of cultural advisers seems a natural evolution of simply growing up. I am sure that Oliver, like most people, doesn\u2019t want to upset people, and when faced with criticism has tried to find ways to address the situation. And he is doing it in the very unremarkable way of gathering a team to help.But this isn\u2019t just about having a specialist advisory team \u2013 it is about the topic of cultural appropriation. In 2018,for a recipe called \u201cpunchy jerk rice,\u201d when jerk marinade is specific to meat. And in 2014,over his \u201cjollof rice\u201d recipe which contained many elements not found in the dish. Indeed,that: \u201cJamie Oliver\u2019s jollof rice hurts my soul.\u201d In these cases, Oliver is both appropriating dishes, and inaccurately conveying their essence.Oliver is not the only celebrity chef to find himself in hot water over cultural appropriation, as Gordon Ramsay discovered when his \u201c\u201d Lucky Cat opened in London in 2019. And that\u2019s why this topic is worth a little more investigation when talking about Oliver specifically, and in general when thinking about celebrity chefs.The issue central to cultural appropriation is power. Therefore, no matter how many people Oliver is surrounded by, he is always going to be veering into the arena of cultural appropriation. He can, as can anyone, cook whatever cuisine he wants to. He can do this with respect, with research and with correct accreditation (which in the recipe world includes naming a dish correctly). But when someone is making money, or gaining recognition and kudos, off the back of something that is not their own \u2013 and therefore off others\u2019 work, histories, talents, techniques, culture \u2013 that is an appropriation. The teams that Oliver has, to watch out for cultural faux pas, are presumably non-White. In which case the responsibility of a White chef\u2019s professional conduct is left to the shoulders of brown and Black people; an appropriation of knowledge, albeit one that is attached to a salary or consultancy fee.Gordon Ramsay's new 'authentic Asian' restaurant kicks off cultural appropriation disputeIf we lived in a world where there were Chinese chefs, Black Caribbean chefs, Sri Lankan chefs all with the same footing and cookbook empire as Oliver, we wouldn\u2019t be having this conversation. But we aren\u2019t, and as Oliver points out in the Sunday Times article, he is a phenomenon \u2013 very few people sell the number of books he does. Why is that? Foods from the Global South are not considered with the same value as the Global North, unless touched by a White hand \u2013 aka a Jamie Oliver. He brings perceived value and accessibility to these foods.Cultural appropriation is also about the multiplicity of stories. There are many Italian chefs winning global awards and talking about their grandmother\u2019s handmade pasta/ragu/bread made in their kitchen/country house/dining room table, that we don\u2019t think a twist on a lasagna recipe is in any way authentic. And we will still pay good money to eat at a fancy Italian restaurant, even if our non-Italian mothers make an excellent carbonara. We know that there are many, many ways to cook, eat and be Italian.We don\u2019t have many stories from award-winning Jamaican chefs telling us the personal and familial variations of jerk, and the labor of love and the heartbreaking history of these recipes. We do have. Therefore, bearing in mind the size of his readership, the predominant story of jerk (one of escaped enslaved people and Indigenous knowledge) is told to a wide audience by one Jamie Oliver, as a list of ingredients and a method to put them together. Recipes devoid of context.The path that Yotam Ottolenghi is on seems a possible road to take. He openly co-authors books and has a diverse group of chefs that have benefited from their collaborations with him, and are now seeing successes on their own \u2013 Goh Helen, Ixta Belfrage, Ramael Scully, to name a few. Maybe this is what Jamie Oliver is looking to achieve with his new show, give exposure to new voices in cooking. But until his brand is not all about the lovable lad, the boy-done-good \u2013 the individual \u2013 there is no room to truly share space, and all we are left with is faceless teams on hand to explain that \u201cEmpire Chicken\u201d is a truly terrible idea."

        "text": "Editor\u2019s Note:Jonathan Reiner, MD, is a CNN medical analyst and professor of medicine and surgery at George Washington University. The views expressed in this commentary belong to the author. View moreon CNN.The news last week that David Bennett, a 57-year-old Maryland man, nearing death, had undergonesent shock waves through the medical community and was hailed as a breakthrough in bioengineering, potentially ushering in ain solid organ transplantation. While our experience with this technology is still developing and much more research needs to be done, the operation and bravura science that made it possible provide a breathtaking glimpse into a future where patients will potentially spend days rather than months or years on a transplant list.This year, theof Americans hoping for a transplant will anxiously await the call telling them an organ has been found. Some of the patients, sick with congestive heart failure, will wait for a heart. Those with end-stage renal disease who are being sustained with dialysis, will wait for a kidney. Others with liver disease, or failing lungs will also wait their turn. There are currentlywho are on the waiting list for an organ transplant, according to the United Network for Organ Sharing. In 2021, only about 41,000 organ transplants were performed \u2013 the highest annual figure since at least 1988,. Given the high demand, some patients will continue to wait. Others will eventually die. More than anything else, the problem is a lack of donor organs.I was relieved when my sons got mild Covid-19. Then I thought about thisIt has been 54 years since Dr. Christiaan Barnard performed thewith the, who had a fatal brain injury after being hit by a car, into the chest ofwho was dying of heart failure. Mr. Washkansky lived for 18 days, but Dr. Barnard\u2019slived for 18 months with his transplanted heart.Over the ensuing half-century, while surgical techniques have been greatly refined for preserving and transplanting solid organs like the heart, kidneys, lungs and liver, some of the greatest advances have fostered the development of novel drugs allowing patients to live for many years without the risk of organ rejection. Now, the majority of heart transplant recipients survive.While the safety and efficacy of transplantation have improved immeasurably over the last several decades, the supply of donor organs remains a problem. There are multiple barriers to organ donation including family reluctance and a general lack of social education about the lifesaving nature of organ transplantation. The net result is aof donor organs. The breakthrough implication of Mr. Bennett\u2019s recent surgery is not only what it does for heart transplants, but also what it does for the supply of organs for transplant surgery as a whole.Alexis Ohanian, aka Mr. Serena Williams, on why parental leave is good for menXenotransplantation, the transplant into a human of an organ from a nonhuman animal, has been tried without success in the past. In 1984 Stephanie Fae Beauclair (who was called Baby Fae) was born with. In an attempt to save her life, she underwent cardiac transplantation with the heart of a baboon. She died of organ rejection 21 days after surgery.For a nonhuman donor organ to function adequately in a human host, it must be anatomically similar (so as to allow for surgical implantation), function well in the human setting and not be rejected. (Graft rejection is a risk all transplant recipients face, however it is particularly challenging when the donor organ originates from a nonhuman source.)Although the heart of a grown pig is anatomically similar to a human heart, for Bennett\u2019s operation, researchers at the University of Maryland modifiedin the pig. Some pig genes were disabled or \u201cknocked out\u201d to prevent acute rejection. Another gene was modified to prevent the donor heart from continuing to grow to an unacceptably large size after transplantation. Several human genes were given to the pig to prevent clotting abnormalities in the new heart. As is also required for this type of transplant, powerful anti-rejection drugs were administered as well.We will know relatively soon whether the audacious operation restores Bennett\u2019s health. While his recovery is uncertain and perhaps even a long shot, what is certain is that the door to using bioengineered nonhuman organs has been opened \u2013 and with it, the promise of an almost unlimited supply of donor organs could follow. While the road ahead is surely filled with new physiological, technical and even ethical challenges, we may one day look at this courageous procedure the way we now look at Dr. Christaan Barnard\u2019s first heart transplant."

        "text": "Editor\u2019s Note:Matthias Katsch is the founder and spokesman of, a German-based non-profit association representing people affected by sexual violence in the Catholic Church. The views expressed in this commentary are his own. Read moreon CNN.As a survivor of sexual violence at the hands of two Jesuit priests in Berlin when I was a, I, like many victims, have long remained silent. I made a commitment to end this silence 12 years ago. I had thought I was alone. But there were many of us.After learning in 2010 that my perpetrators were transferred to different churches, giving them opportunities to hurt more children, I knew I had to speak out. I was petrified to realize that I wasn\u2019t alone. At my school alone, 60 other victims came forward with their stories, and together we founded the victims\u2019 initiative \u201c,\u201d of which I am still the managing director and spokesperson.In the Catholic world, Germany\u2019s national branch is. Yet, despite its vast financial wealth, survivors of this abuse, including myself, have received only afor the horrors we have been through. Most of the perpetrators, meanwhile, were allowed to continue with their lives with no real consequences.The magnitude of sexual violence brought to light by Eckiger Tisch and others in 2010 triggered the first of several church abuse scandals in Germany in recent years. In numerous schools and other institutions of the Catholic Church, hundreds of victims came forward in a short amount of time.found that protectors of the perpetrators silenced victims and ignored their allegations. A pattern of cover-up tactics was revealed.It\u2019s a pattern I recognize in the latest revelations about the former Pope Benedict XVI. Between 1977 and 1982, he was known as Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, the Archbishop of Munich and Freising. During Ratzinger\u2019s time there, he oversaw the clerics in the archdiocese, including those accused of sexual abuse. It took a legal,to shine a light on the culture of cover-up and protection for perpetrators, which Ratzinger failed to address. Only two years later, Ratzinger left Munich to go to Rome as chief guardian of the faith, where he was also responsible for dealing with abuse cases for 25 years.Pope Benedict XVI admits being at meeting about abuser priest when he ran Munich archdioceseOnly after written evidence which appeared in theRatzingerbeing at a meeting about an abuser priest when he ran the Munich diocese. He blamed an earlier denial on \u201can error in the editing of his statement.\u201dNow his past is catching up with him and the rest of the Catholic Church. With the accusations reaching the top of the hierarchy, this is yet another devastating moment for the entire institution. How can we trust the institution led by individuals who have protected church leaders and abusers ahead of children?The scandals are a lifetime scar for the children that experienced them. Sexual abuse has an impact onMany victims have psychological problems, some develop addictions. You might ask, how does one move on from a sexual assault at the hands of those who teach you about family and community values? How do we provide healing when we see the head of church implicated in the misconduct? The answers are not straightforward, but they begin with the overhaul of a Catholic Church system that is rotten to the core.One could see this latest inquiry as an opportunity for the Catholic Church to unite in this fight, address its problems and become part of the solution. Hundreds of millions of children are still cared for and grow up in the Catholic Church, and we have seen how destructive cover-ups can be.It is the bravery of the Munich victims that, yet again, has exposed the Catholic Church\u2019s protection of predators. Those victims had to exert pressure on the powerful to act, trust and confide in the legal process and share their stories. Without those survivors willing to come forward, this struggle to free victims from silence, loneliness and guilt would not exist.The tragedy of sexual abuse at the hands of priests equals the scale and reach of the Catholic Church globally. As one of the world\u2019s oldest and largest institutions, its power and scandals are not limited to one city, region or country.there were 1.3 billion baptized Catholics worldwide, represented by 3,500 dioceses and eparchies around the world. There is hardly a country where theamong those dioceses. And as the survivors keep coming forward, we are reminded that this isn\u2019t a problem of the past.Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI Fast FactsWe know that sexual violence against children and young people stretches back far beyond the Catholic Church abuse of the 1970 and 1980s. Children and adolescents are exposed to sexual violence in many forms at a staggering rate.violence affects the lives of up to 1 billion children worldwide, with long-lasting and costly emotional, social and economic consequences.At the beginning of the pandemic, UNICEF and other international organizationshundreds of millions of children around the world will likely face increasing threats to their safety and well-being \u2013 including mistreatment, gender-based violence, exploitation, social exclusion and separation from caregivers.I welcome the adoption of the United Nations\u2019 Sustainable Development Goals,, which includes a commitment to end violence. This, along with the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, places the dignity of children and their right to live free from violence and fear as a priority on the international development agenda. We have also seen the creation of the US National Blueprint to End Sexual Violence Against Children and Adolescents, providing a road map of steps for the US federal government to prevent sexual violence against children and adolescents. It ensures that those who experience sexual violence have access to the healing and justice they deserve.For the first time, we have a chance to put pressure on Western countries as survivors from all over the world, united bya network of abuse survivor associations, who will be joining the 2022 G7 Summit in the Bavarian Alps in Germany. We will be calling on governments to deliver practical and cost-effective programs, policies and systems that prevent child abuse and provide effective interventions to assist children and families during and after a crisis, helping survivors heal and seek justice. It is time for an international action plan to be adapted in each country.The Catholic Church can lead the way and organize a victims\u2019 recovery ministry and adequate compensation for its victims worldwide. It must open its archives and allow independent investigations even in its headquarters. During the last years of Benedict\u2019s reign, and further under Francis, many hoped for reforms and open dialogue led by the church. But with recent revelations, it is clear that the issues are as deep as the scars of the survivors, and we are yet to see a leader who is not afraid of the past.Ratzinger\u2019s fall this week in Munich is a significant turning point. It shows perpetrators can no longer hide in the shadows of those protecting them. Victims are no longer defenseless. We are no longer speechless. As human rights activists and survivors of sexual abuse, we are liberating ourselves and ensuring a future where children can grow up free from violence and abuse in every corner of the world."

She is a weekly opinion contributor to CNN, a contributing columnist to The Washington Post and a columnist for World Politics Review. The views expressed in this commentary are her own. Viewon CNN.By the time the closing ceremony marked the end of Russia\u2019s 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, pro-Russian demonstrators in Ukraine\u2019s Crimean Peninsula were already. Within days, the unidentifiedmasked soldiers with hidden insignia, began what became Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s most brazen violation of international law: the capture andof another country\u2019s territory.Putin waited until the Sochi games were over to launch the attack on Crimea, probably so as not to detract from what he hoped would be a showcase for Russian achievement. There were other theories about the timing \u2013 including an effort to distract from theof massive corruption around the expense of hosting The Games \u2013 but the need to keep a spotlight on Sochi was likely a motivating factor.Eight years later, as Putin prepares to attend the opening ceremony of Beijing\u2019s Winter Olympics next week, Russian troops have amassed along Ukraine\u2019s borders, awaiting the Russian President\u2019s decision on whether or not to invade.This time, Putin will likely think twice before overshadowing the Olympics (or at least the earlier part of it) and marring Chinese leader Xi Jinping\u2019s time to shine on the global stage. That\u2019s because Putin and Xi have become the world\u2019s autocracy bros.The two leaders have undertaken eerily similar tactics to achieve the results to which they both aspire. They have bothso they can stay in power for decades beyond their term limits. To maintain their grip on power, they are also increasinglyat home,critics \u2013 and worse,and seeking to expand their country\u2019s sphere of influence.They have shown themselves willing to do whatever it takes to silence calls for democracy and human rights at home. They have cracked down and accused their own citizens of acting as puppets of foreign powers, as if it were impossible to live in China or Russia \u2013 in, say,or\u2013 and genuinely desire democracy.Putin's big miscalculationChina makes it a point to tell its citizens and the world that Western-style democracy is an, chaotic and ineffective system. Russia, too, portrays the US as a declining superpower, but a threatening one nonetheless. They argue that democracy and human rights, rather than a universal yearning, are a fabrication of the West. And, for good measure, they silence anyone who seems to be accumulating too much power,, unless they seem.Rather than a significant ideological motivation, the main purpose of these repressive tactics is to protect their rule.Putin talks about NATO and the threat it poses to Russia\u2019s borders. But it\u2019s Ukraine\u2019s turn towardthat troubles him most. The yearning for freedom is contagious and he knows it. So does Xi.Putin knows that a democratic Ukraine on Russia\u2019s border can inspire those at home who want change, just as West Germany\u2019s freedoms during the Cold War prompted the Soviet Bloc to build a wall around East Berlin. In the 1980s, Putin wasas a foreign KGB agent when East Germans tore down the wall \u2013 an event that set the stage for the Soviet Union\u2019s collapse.In Ukraine, one question looms: What will we do if Russia attacks?To cement their hold on power, autocrats love to stage mega-events, none better than the Olympics. They represent an opportunity to proclaim their success to their people and to the world; to make the unspoken argument that, whatever price they have extracted in repression, the ends have justified the means. For maximum impact, however, they need the world\u2019s rapt attention.This week,that Xi asked Putin to postpone an invasion of Ukraine until after the Beijing Games, but they made no secret of their disdain for those who claim Ukraine has a right to choose its own path. After Xi and Putin, state television, \u201cAt present, certain international forces are arbitrarily interfering in the internal affairs of China and Russia under the guise of democracy and human rights.\u201d Xi and Putin, brothers in arms!And arms they have. Military force is a key tool in their strategy to expand the spheres of influence beyond their borders. The Chinese military is buildingand military bases in disputed waters; routinely flying military aircraft around Taiwanese airspace and otherwise. Russia has deployed its military, Ukraine and. And next month its forces are scheduled to, adding another threat to Ukraine from the north.China and Russia have a history of rivalry and there are still areas of friction. (Whose sphere of influence, for example, should Central Asia \u2013 including Kazakhstan \u2013 fall under? They both want it.) But for now, Xi and Putin are linking arms against their main foe, the United States, and its allies in Europe. Both China and Russia face Western sanctions. The two men see in each other a kindred, autocratic spirit.For Putin, Kazakhstan is a domino too big to fallOne week before the Olympic torch is due to arrive in Beijing, with China facing aof The Games by several democratic countries, and Russia in the midst of tense negotiations over Ukraine, the Chinese foreign ministry spokesman, Zhao Lijian, nearly waxed lyrical when he declared, \u201cThere is no ceiling to China-Russia mutual trust, no forbidden zone in our strategic cooperation and no limit on how far our long-standing friendship can go.\u201dAfter such a passionate declaration, it\u2019s hard to imagine Putin would knowingly overshadow China\u2019s Olympic moment. Of course, the last time China hosted The Games in 2008, Putin sent his troops into Georgia. That, however, was long before Xi rose to the top job.This time around, China had the United Nations adopt anresolution, a moving commitment to refrain from hostilities from one week before the start of The Games to one week after the end of the Paralympic Games. If Putin decides he wants to invade Ukraine, that time frame \u2013 until March 20 \u2013 is much too long. By then, Ukraine\u2019s frozen ground will have melted into barely-passable mud for Russian tanks.Meanwhile, the US and Ukraine don\u2019t appear to be on the same page over the level of threat of a Russian attack. A senior Ukrainian officialthat a call between Biden and his counterpart Volodymyr Zelensky \u201cdidn\u2019t go well\u201d \u2013 an account the White House disputed.As for Russia\u2019s next move, only one president really knows the answer. When Putin sits in the stands at the Bird\u2019s Nest stadium in Beijing on February 4, watching the opening ceremonies, he will likely keep his troops waiting a few days, even if he has decided to launch what would be a calamitous invasion. He will do it for Xi\u2019s sake. After all, that\u2019s the least a brother can do.Unless, of course, he chooses to go in before The Games begin. In which case, the clock is ticking."

She is also a member of the American Academy of Pediatrics. The views expressed in this commentary are her own. Read moreon CNN.Soon, parents across the country may finally have the option to vaccinate their young kids against Covid-19. Pfizer and BioNTechthey are requesting emergency use authorization for their Covid-19 vaccine for children ages 6 months to 5 years, signaling the potential arrival of a vaccine for this age group in the weeks to come, pending review of the safety and efficacy data.What feels to many parents like long-awaited news has others thinking long and hard about the choice ahead of them. Currently, only three in 10 parents say they\u2019ll get their child under the age of 5 vaccinated as soon as possible when a Covid-19 vaccine is authorized,As a pediatrician, I find this response disheartening. As a new mom to a beautiful boy who will be 6 months this March, I understand this parental concern. I have come to accept that worrying is part of being a parent, and despite being well versed in the science, I too have paused to ask myself whether I\u2019m ready to give my baby the Covid-19 vaccine. My most important job as a mama is, after all, keeping him safe.Knowing then, that some of us may be torn by the choice ahead of us, but that all of us want to keep our children safe, I want to share with you a few of the things that are bringing me comfort as the Covid-19 vaccine for young children makes its way through the regulatory process.Few things in this world are inspected and monitored as closely as childhood vaccinations, and for good reason. Vaccines, unlike drugs to treat illnesses, are given to healthy children in order to keep them healthy. Because of this, the standard for safety and efficacy that vaccines must clear for approval is incredibly high.A teacher's plea for help amid OmicronWhen it comes to the Covid-19 vaccines specifically, we have had so much collective experience with their safety and efficacy. To date, overof the Pfizer vaccine have been given in the United States alone and the vast majority have been tolerated with no significant problems.I have also found it helpful to remember that following vaccination, immunity lasts in the body but the vaccine itself does not. Many parents have shared with me their concerns about the long-term effects of the vaccine on their kids\u2019 development, future fertility and growth. I often explain the vaccine is a type of brief message to tell the body to make the protection against the virus, and once received and acted upon, the body destroys the message.In other words, the vaccineand are not present at a concentration or duration that could interfere with children\u2019s development or fertility,In what can at times be an overwhelming stream of news, it can be hard to keep track of just how thorough the vaccine review and approval process is in this country.Before a pharmaceutical company can receive emergency use authorization for a vaccine, trial participants are observed for anI find this wait requirement particularly reassuring. In decades past, when a vaccine was found to cause a rare but potentially serious side effect, it occurred. The two-month average wait period is therefore a way to ensure these potential side effects have had enough time to manifest themselves before the regulators even examine the data.Once the data is submitted to the US Food and Drug Administration, it isand, if appropriate, the vaccine is given EUA. From there it goes to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, where yet another group of independent experts, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), examine it and make recommendations about how the vaccine should be administered to the American public. Typically, the CDC director will accept the committee\u2019s recommendation.Behind the long names and acronyms, these committees are made up of some of the most brilliant scientific minds of our time, which gives me yet another reason to believe in the process.The vaccinations children routinely receive have all been through this process over the years and have been shown to be safe and effective. This has until now led me to vaccinate my son as soon as he has been eligible against illnesses like hepatitis B, diphtheria, polio, whooping cough and others. As the Covid-19 vaccine makes its way through the regulatory process in the coming weeks, I hope to be able to tune out the noise, to set aside any anxiety and, with as clear a mind as a new mom can have, know that the FDA and CDC recommendations will be grounded in facts and made by those who have worked diligently for decades to protect our kids from potentially serious and at times deadly illnesses. I can only wish the same for you."

View moreon CNN.Usually when a comedian\u2019s name is trending on social media, it\u2019s because they did something questionable that\u2019ll likely end with cancellation. But because you will never hear anyone say anything bad about Bob Saget, I knew when I saw his name in social feeds on Sunday that this was something more ominous.I waited, hoping someone would say it wasn\u2019t true, but it was later confirmed: Sagetat the age of 65.In the days that followed, many people, especially comedians, have shared stories about Saget\u2019s talent, but also his kindness and support. For some, he was a father figure from his days on \u201cFull House.\u201d For others, he was their favorite comedian \u2013 one with an.For me, it was personal: Bob Saget literally changed the entire arc of my life.On April 1, 2011, I was a partner at a small litigation firm in Chicago. The combative world of judges and attorneys drained me mentally and physically. I no longer had time for my personal passions, including playing guitar and managing musicians. Looking for a creative outlet, I\u2019d begun taking weekly improv classes at the legendary Second City theater with a friend. I thought maybe it could help me become a better litigator.Ted Lasso got on board with the idea of a tie as a win. Maybe the rest of us should tooThis friend also happened to perform stand-up, and on that April day he was opening for a sold-out Bob Saget show in nearby Hammond, Indiana. He invited me to tag along to keep him calm and \u201cmanage\u201d him, given my talent management background.As I walked up to the theater, I saw Saget exit his limo. Thanks to a few drinks from the Cubs\u2019 opening home game (), I had the courage to approach him. When I introduced myself as a friend and \u201cmanager\u201d of his opening act, Saget immediately shook my hand.Noticing my Cubs gear, he disarmed me with a discussion about baseball and guitars, the latter of which he played in part of his stand-up set. I remember how kind and sincere he was, asking follow-up questions as we walked through the venue looking for the green room.  What celebrity is cordial to a manager, let alone a pseudo-manager? That\u2019s the kind of person Saget was. When we ran into one another backstage before the show, he even invited me to hang out in his green room as he tuned his guitar, letting me try my hand at playing it.As I began strumming, I filled the empty space with a comical yet self-deprecating anecdote about my music days, telling him how I played in multiple bands and got fired from multiple bands, even though I was the one who put the bands together. My head was down, focused on the guitar, yet I heard a distinct and familiar noise: a whole-hearted laugh. I\u2019d made someone famous laugh! And not just anyone; Danny Tanner! Bob Saget from \u201cThe Aristocrats!\u201d He laughed. Out loud. At something I said. What happened next was even more surreal.Betty White's legacy goes far beyond the screen\u201cYou should do that bit tonight on stage,\u201d he told me. I thought maybe he\u2019d mistaken me for my friend, so I informed him that I wasn\u2019t performing and that wasn\u2019t a rehearsed bit \u2013 I\u2019d never done stand-up before, I said, and in fact litigated for a living. Saget was unfazed, and actually seemed more convinced to have me go up.  (In hindsight, it makes sense; he shocked people for a living when he worked blue on stage, especially those who knew him as \u201cFull House\u2019s\u201d virtuous single father. What\u2019s more shocking than a funny lawyer?)Even though he continued to goad me to go on, I knew to quit while I was ahead. I\u2019d made Bob Saget laugh. That was enough for the night.But his encouragement lingered in my mind as I watched his show. It felt like some approval I had been searching for all my life. I cannot tell you what judges or juries have said about me from my years as an attorney, but even as I write this 11 years later I distinctly remember Bob Saget\u2019s laugh in that green room.  While I was a fan of watching stand-up comedy, performing it was never on my radar.I don\u2019t know what he was thinking, or why he seemed invested in seeing me perform. And maybe my interpretation was clouded by the drinks I\u2019d had at that Cubs game. But because of my newly discovered confidence in my comedic abilities, I performed at my first open mic the very next day.I still can't stop watching Cecily Strong's clown sketchWhen it was my turn, I repeated the story that had tickled Saget, and it was a hit once again. I was hooked. The immediate rush of adrenaline from the audience\u2019s response far exceeded the wins I\u2019d experienced in even high-profile cases. The power of those laughs propelled me to heights I\u2019d never had in a courtroom. And this was an open mic with 20 people in the room, for zero pay.For some time, I actually did become a better \u2013 and funnier \u2013 attorney. But after a few years of performing comedy on the side, I left my law firm to pursue what I feel is my natural calling.  Today, I am a full-time stand-up comedian.I often think about what would have happened if I didn\u2019t make that show and never met Bob Saget. Would I eventually have found my way to comedy? Or would I still be miserably attending court calls during the week and searching for a creative purpose on weekends, playing in a Dave Matthews cover band in the suburbs of Chicago?I recently reached out to Saget to make sure he knew this story, as I have told it in nearly every interview when asked about my comedy \u201corigin story.\u201d  I heard through the grapevine that he knew. But last year, 10 years after our encounter, I messaged him directly to make sure he realized what he meant to me \u2013 and not just for his encouragement, but also for his stand-up;; his autobiography; his; and of course \u201cFull House\u201d and \u201cAmerica\u2019s Funniest Home Videos,\u201d which were staples of my childhood.As he recalled in his book, when comedians came to him for advice Saget would share what Don Rickles once told him about audiences: \u201cThey wanna stop you. Nobody wants to help you.  Just go forward \u2026 like a tank.\u201dOff-stage, Bob Saget did the opposite. All he ever did was support and help. For better or worse, Bob Saget is the reason I am a stand-up comedian. He is the reason I know I am funny.  He is the reason I am happy.  Maybe I would have eventually found another way to stand-up, but my journey started with Bob\u2019s kindness and encouragement. Along with our fellow comedians and fans, I\u2019m forever grateful for the positive influence he spread while he was alive."

We\u2019re looking back at the strongest, smartestof the week from CNN and other outlets.\u201cYou\u2019re so merry,\u201d says Tom Wambsgans in the \u201cToo Much Birthday\u201d episode of \u201cSuccession,\u201d the television series that depicts the desperately unhappy lives of a media mogul family.\u201cYou seem much happier than me, Greg,\u201d Tom complains to his relative-by-marriage, who\u2019s exulting over landing a date. Cousin Greg comes across as clueless in the show on HBO (which, like CNN, is owned by WarnerMedia), until he periodically reveals his inner sage.He reallyhappy, Greg admits \u2013 \u201cI like her\u201d \u2013 and then advises: \u201cIt\u2019s not a finite pie; we can both be happy.\u201dIn 2021, happiness has too often seemed like a \u201cfinite pie.\u201d The year began with an attack on the US Capitol and ended with surges of Covid-19 in a pandemic that refuses to release its hold on us.In our last weekly opinion column before the new year, we\u2019re focusing on the points of view that were most popular with you \u2013 and with the team at CNN Opinion \u2013 this year. (We\u2019re taking a break next week and returning on January 2.)You can sample the 40 pieces that told the story of the year. Last week, CNN Opinion\u2019srecounted the \u201csocial commentary and cultural criticism that helped us look hard into the darkness, bridge the gaps between us and, sometimes,.\u201dWe have the rare luxury of being able to publish opinion pieces on any topic under \u2013 and around \u2013 the sun, and the favorites some of our team members chose reflect that variety, touching on everything from space junk to \u201cTed Lasso\u201d to the Czech election.Here are their choices:pickedbyRemember that brief, sweet window in May, when we could set aside any worries we had about Covid-19 and our decaying democracy and ask ourselves, \u201cWhat are the odds a rocket will fall out of the sky and land on me?\u201d The Long March 5B rocket was one of the largest uncontrolled space objects to fall out of orbit, and most of it burned up when it reentered the Earth\u2019s atmosphere, according to the Chinese government. \u201cReentry is considered the most desirable outcome as it removes space junk from orbit where it can collide with functioning satellites, create more junk, and threaten human life when it comes to crewed spacecraft,\u201d according to Dr. Alice Gorman, who is also known as Dr. Space Junk. But very little has been done on the environmental impact of this incineration in the atmosphere. Learn more in this fascinating piece, which includes this gem of a sentence: \u201cEarth\u2019s atmosphere has become a liminal zone that marks a zombie spacecraft\u2019s transition to true death.\u201d\u2019s favorite wasbyI\u2019m a few years older than Gen Z\u2019ers, but I can fully relate to their desire to recreate some aspects of early 2000s culture while choosing to leave other less desirable parts in the dust. Holly Thomas captured this feeling of selective nostalgia perfectly when she wrote: \u201cAs a millennial who grew up during the noughties, I both envy and admire Gen Z\u2019ers\u2019 capacity to idealize those years. It\u2019s unfair that they\u2019re managing to make bucket hats and aggressive brand logos look anything besides tragic, but commendable that they\u2019re paying a ton more mind to where they\u2019re sourcing their clothes than we did.\u201dchosebyandAmid the stresses of the ongoing pandemic, one show reminded me to pause and enjoy the simple pleasures in life \u2014 \u201cTed Lasso.\u201d David M. Perry and Matthew Gabriele\u2019s op-ed on \u201cTed Lasso\u201d beautifully captures why the show succeeds in helping viewers disconnect from their day-to-day realities and instead embrace a world in which friendship and community take priority. They write that \u201cTed Lasso\u201d proves to us \u201cthere\u2019s a world possible in which people can count on one another.\u201d And while that\u2019s a lesson not even all the characters master by the end of the second season, it\u2019s one we can all aspire to as we enter the new year.pickedbyThis year hasn\u2019t been the breakthrough for equality that 2020 promised it could be. But at the very least, it seems we are getting better at calling out those disparities in all facets of American life \u2013 even within our response to tragedy. When 22-year-old Gabby Petito vanished on a road trip with her fiance in the fall, her story was a top headline from coast to coast in a rightful effort to gather information and bring a young woman home safely. And yet, as retired police captain Sonia Pruitt observed, it also reignited \u201ca national conversation about the lasting spotlight that is often given to missing White people, compared to their non-White counterparts.\u201d With this case, two things were true at once: Something horrible had happened to Petito and the nation was aware of it \u2013 and something horrible is happening when the missing person cases of people of color don\u2019t get nearly as much empathy. With thoughtfulness and sensitivity, Pruitt captured this reality with an unblinking honesty, calling on all of us to engage and change this truth. \u201cWhile Petito\u2019s family should of course be allowed to use everything at their disposal to get to the bottom of exactly what happened to Gabby, we cannot ignore the effects of that same level of access not being extended to the Black and brown, who are just as desperate to find missing loved ones,\u201d Pruitt wrote. \u201cAs a former police captain, it is particularly concerning what message this could be sending to perpetrators: that young people of color are easy targets because few will care to look for them.\u201dchosebyIn 2021, like 2020 before it, so many of us spent time feeling powerless or out of control. There was so much in our lives we couldn\u2019t do or weren\u2019t empowered to change, even when we wanted to. But as historian Lara Freidenfelds reminded us in this powerful piece on the need to rethink the language we use about pregnancy loss: Choices that seem small at the time can have enormous consequences in the everyday lives of those around us. By saying \u201closs\u201d instead of \u201cbereavement\u201d to make space to be inclusive of more people\u2019s diverse experiences and myriad feelings about miscarriage isn\u2019t just more accurate to the history of human beings\u2019 reproductive lives, she tells us; it\u2019s a more compassionate (and ultimately revolutionary) way to build policy. It\u2019s something we can do from where we stand to change harmful taboos and make people feel seen. Fundamentally, her point is that words have power and we can use them more effectively to make people\u2019s lives better. This year, that was a message I cherished and tried to live into.To, this piece stood out:by\u201cCzech election\u201d and \u201cedge-of-your-seat drama\u201d are not two phrases I would normally put together. But on a recent gray weekend in October I found myself reporting on exactly that \u2013 a cliffhanger election involving the \u201cCzech Donald Trump,\u201d a hospitalized president and a group called the \u201cPirate Party.\u201d Dean Obeidallah smartly unpacks why this offbeat election \u2013 where opposition parties joined forces to topple populist Prime Minister Andrej Babi\u0161 \u2013 has so much to teach the US about defeating Trumpism. Obeidallah writes that the US needs \u201ca pro-democracy coalition in the same way leaders in the Czech Republic were able to put aside political differences to defeat a right-wing, populist leader.\u201d And with more strongman elections coming up in 2022 (Orban in Hungary and Bolsonaro in Brazil), it\u2019s a tactic other nations will be watching closely.Many of our most popular pieces flowed out of the end of Donald Trump\u2019s presidency and the start of Joe Biden\u2019s. Power was ultimately handed over on January 20, but the closing days of the Trump White House were epically chaotic, as police struggled to put down an insurrection aimed at stopping Congress\u2019 certification of Biden\u2019s victory and officials coped with the aftereffects. On January 6, after Trump supporters stormed the Capitol,called for \u201cMike Pence and the members of the Cabinet to pull the country back.\u201dAs the year went on, many Republicans pivoted from condemning the attack to making excuses for it. But there were notable exceptions \u2013 including former President George W. Bush. Aswrote, \u201cBush summed up the reaction to the attack on our Capitol \u2014 or at least the reaction of all decent, patriotic Americans \u2014 in just six words, as evocative as they are accurate:\u201dTrump never admitted that he lost the election, repeating instead a fabricated story that he was cheated by massive voter fraud. His refusal to come to terms with reality dominates the Republican Party today.It was no surprise that Trump didn\u2019t invite Biden to the White House for the traditional meeting between outgoing and incoming presidents, but even first lady Melania Trump skipped the nicety of hosting Jill Biden for tea. \u201cUnderstandably lost in the morass of the horrifying things that have happened leading up to Joe Biden\u2019s inauguration is something that did not happen,\u201d wrote. \u201cMelania Trump will become the first modern first ladyto the White House for a walk-through of the private living quarters on the second and third floors.\u201dTrump skipped the inauguration, flying home to Mar-a-Lago on Air Force One, but Washington wasn\u2019t done with him. The former president had been impeached a week before his term was over and was eventually put on trial for the second time in the Senate, which voted to acquit him of inciting an insurrection. Days before his trial, Trump\u2019s legal team quit and had to be hastily replaced. Aswrote, \u201cIt\u2019s telling that the source of the falling-out between Trump and his (former) lawyers was\u201dIn red states across the nation, Republican legislators passed bills to limit access to the polls and bring election administrators more tightly under the control of political forces that could potentially overrule voters in future elections. As in other states, Trump spread phony questions about the results in Arizona, where Biden won by a narrow margin. There, Maricopa County Recorderpushed back hard against Trump\u2019s insinuations.It was timehe wrote in May. \u201cThe truth is that there is no solid evidence of significant fraud in Maricopa County\u2019s November 3 election. There is no solid evidence that the election in Maricopa County was stolen from former President Trump. That is why all eight cases brought in Arizona state and federal courts alleging widespread fraud, inaccuracies, or irregularities lost spectacularly.\u201dAs former world chess championwrote in the CNN Opinion \u201cVoices of Freedom\u201d series, democracy is too precious to let slip away. \u201cHailing from the Soviet Union, a repressive regime and precursor to Putin\u2019s Russia, I have always understood that democracy is a privilege \u2013. But over the last few years, I have watched with growing alarm as many Americans lose faith in their democratic system\u2026 Because democratic sentiment is weak, the rights to vote and free speech are more vulnerable in my adopted home of America today than at any point in my life.\u201d Now, \u201cwe can either be the generation that renews democracy, or loses it forever,\u201d Kasparov declared.\u201cThe clearestthat he really won the 2020 election,\u201d wrote CNN Opinion\u2019s. \u201cDespite any evidence of systematic voter fraud, Trump and his loyalists continue to sow doubt about Biden\u2019s victory in the minds of the American people\u2026 they are achieving some degree of success. 36% of Americans \u2013 and a startling 78% of Republicans \u2013 now believe Biden did not win enough votes to be the legitimately elected president.\u201dFacebook was among the social media platforms that came under a torrent of criticism over the spread of misinformation about the election \u2013 and Covid-19 vaccines.The company, which now operates under the new corporate title of \u201cMeta,\u201d iswrote, after \u201cFrances Haugen, a former Facebook project manager and now whistleblower, said the company is well aware that its social network is being used to promote hate, violence and misinformation \u2013 but it has tried to cover up the evidence in order to generate more revenue.\u201dBiden plowed ahead with pledges to return the nation to normalcy and lead America out of the Covid-19 pandemic, only to run into the Delta and Omicron variants of the virus. Still, he succeeded in passing and signing legislation to spend trillions to stimulate the economy and rebuild bridges, roads and other infrastructure. He repaired some alliances that had been strained in the Trump years and visited the UK, where his meeting with Queen Elizabeth II was judged a success despite, asnoted.The new President faced divides in his own party, as progressives pushed him to move faster to reduce inequality and counter threats to voting rights while Sens. Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema withheld their support for a massive social spending bill that originally included sharp hikes in taxes on corporations and the wealthy. In September, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez \u201cmade her Met Gala debut in a long white off-shoulder mermaid gown, with \u2018Tax The Rich\u2019 scribed across the back in massive, flag-red letters,\u201d wrote. \u201c, as close as you could come to having a placard at the gala without literally bringing one\u2026\u201dBiden\u2019s decision to pull all US troops out of Afghanistan, in accordance with the peace agreement with the Taliban negotiated by the Trump administration, led to the collapse of the Afghan government and a disorderly exodus from Kabul., the son of a Green Beret killed by a roadside bomb in Afghanistan, wrote, \u201cIf my dad were alive today, I know he would be worried about the thousands of Afghans who risked their lives and their families\u2019 security in service to an America that has\u201dThere were also tensions over the role of Vice President Kamala Harris, asnoted. \u201cI\u2019m hoping she stays the course,,\u201d Jones wrote. \u201cBut please ditch the chuckle. It\u2019s time for Black women to bring their entire selves to the table. And even when we stumble, we got this.\u201dAs the President\u2019s approval ratings dropped, Democrats fretted over who might lead their ticket in 2024 should Biden, who will turn 82 by the next presidential inauguration, choose not to run. Harris and Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, once rivals for the 2020 presidential nomination, don\u2019t have to be competitors, wrote, who suggested.Since the start of 2021, more than 203 million Americans have been fully vaccinated against the virus that causes Covid-19, and more than 58 million have received booster shots. The vaccinations have saved millions from severe illness and death, but the vaccine-hesitant and vaccine resisters remain at great risk.At the beginning of the pandemic, Florida-based emergency room doctorsickest patients were \u201calmost exclusively older people with chronic health problems.\u201d But in July, he wrote, \u201cNow the patients I see, frightened and struggling to breathe, are mostly in their 30s, 40s and 50s. They come from different racial and socioeconomic backgrounds. Many of them have no identifiable risk factors. The one thing many of them have in common: They are all unvaccinated\u2026from a vaccine-preventable illness.\u201dIn April 2020, infectious disease experttoldthat he expected 800,000 Americans could die of the disease within 18 months. Last week, the US surpassed that number, and in a recent follow-up interview conducted by Bergen, Osterholm warned, \u201cThis virus will find you and, unfortunately, many of the outcomes are very sad\u2026We have health care systems around the country, including in my home state of Minnesota, that are hanging on by a thread. We\u2019ve seen health care systems virtually broken by this pandemic. They just couldn\u2019t provide critical care to non-Covid patients. If you\u2019re not going to get vaccinated for yourself, please get vaccinated for your loved ones and for the community because this is a very challenging situation.\u201dThe psychic toll of the pandemic is fearsome, aswrote in January: \u201cMost days I struggle with grief and rage. I often cover my face with my hands. My fingers keep closing into fists.\u201d\u201cWhat is happening to me? To us? Maybe you\u2019re like me: afraid, anxious, nervous, or feeling whatever else you call that paralyzing sensation that radiates from below the ribcage up into your chest. You can\u2019t stop worrying about all you have left to lose.\u201dIn a year when the world focused more than ever on the menace of climate change,traveled to Wyoming to examine the impact of eventually ending the fossil fuel economy.\u201cGillette is the hub of a region called the Powder River Basin, which produces roughly 40% of US coal,\u201d Sutter wrote. \u201cResidents here know that the Biden administration, which rejoined the Paris Agreement on climate change and promises a 100% clean electric grid by 2035,\u201dThe pandemic has been generous to the world\u2019s billionaires \u2013 their wealth has grown dramatically. As if to demonstrate their enormous resources, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and UK entrepreneur Richard Branson flew into space. Elon Musk, whose company SpaceX has jumped in front of rivals in its commercialization of space, was named Time\u2019s Person of the Year.Space tourism offers the luxury of \u201ca Disney park ride for the super-rich,\u201d noted physicist, but there\u2019s more to it than that. The competition could benefit science and business. \u201cThe real bottom line is that theand that has benefits for anyone needing to lift an object above the Earth\u2019s atmosphere.\u201dBut the billionaires should focus on improving life on earth, argued. \u201cMitigating further climate damage is the most urgent challenge currently facing the planet \u2013far more than that of stepping just over the well-trod threshold of space.\u201d\u2026Some highlights from the past week::::::::::::Last weekend\u2019s wave of tornadoes laid waste to Dawson Springs, Kentucky. Officials said about 75% of the town was destroyed. CNN political commentatorand his father,, wrote that the tornadoes \u201cturned the town we love into a wasteland of debris, rubble and memories.\u201d\u201cEvery house on Oak Heights, the street the Jennings family grew up on, has been wiped away. Largely destroyed is the city park where we both spent so many nights on Little League and softball fields.\u201cBut we are lucky. Jeff, who has lived in Dawson Springs since 1958 and graduated from its high school in 1976, made it across town and rode out the storm in a friend\u2019s basement.

        "text": "Editor\u2019s Note:Kara Alaimo, an associate professor in the Lawrence Herbert School of Communication at Hofstra University, writes about women and social media. She was spokeswoman for international affairs in the Treasury Department during the Obama administration. Follow her on Twitter @. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author. Viewat CNNThe US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) isto announce more relaxed guidance on indoor masking as soon as this week, on the heels of decisions by Democratic leaders in states from New York to California tomask restrictions. These policies ignore the reality that 18 million Americans under age 5 arefor coronavirus vaccines \u2013 including my own two daughters.Until vaccines are available to every American, ending mask mandates in public places is irresponsible and immoral. Doing so will endanger the health of young children and further drive parents to make impossible choices \u2013 like whether to go to work or the grocery store and risk bringing home a virus that might harm their children. Giving privileged Americans license to act without regard for the health and well-being of the vulnerable will also take us far from our country\u2019s original ethos, creating the kind of society that can no longer solve our collective problems.While children under age 5 are least likely to get Covid-19, they have a higher death rate than older kids from the virus: They account for 15% of pediatric Covid cases but 35% of pediatric deaths, as Scott Gottlieb, former commissioner of the US Food and Drug Administration,on Twitter. Already, more than 400 children under age 5from this virus in the United States. I believe the death of a single child is unacceptable.What\u2019s more, many parents like me are trying to be extra cautious with our children since we don\u2019t know whether there are significant long-term effects of the virus. (The CDC reported findings showing that children who have had Covid-19 seemto get diabetes, and there\u2019s mounting evidence that a substantial number of children arelong Covid. Dr. Sindhu Mohandas, a pediatric infectious diseases specialist at Children\u2019s Hospital Los Angeles, said her \u201cbest guess\u201d based on limited data available is that long Covid affects 10% to 20% of children.)The chaos from Omicron might be fading, but the turbulence ahead could be worseMy husband is an emergency medicine physician who has been treating Covid-19 patients since the start of this pandemic, so we know firsthand that this is not a virus we want our children to get. We\u2019ve gone to great lengths to prevent them from being exposed. Early on, my husband quarantined in a different part of our home \u2013 missing part of our first daughter\u2019s childhood \u2013 to protect us. It\u2019s unthinkable that I might now face the prospect of bringing this virus home to my daughters simply because others who enjoy the privilege of vaccine eligibility can\u2019t be bothered to put on masks.The argument that people can still choose to wear masks to protect themselves belies an astonishing lack of understanding. Masks aren\u2019t recommended for children under age 2, including one of my daughters, because they couldwearing them. As for older kids and adults, as we saw with the explosively contagious Omicron variant, even if we wear masks ourselves, there is still aof being infected by others who are not wearing them.Lifting mask mandates will therefore drive young children and their parents who don\u2019t want to infect them \u2013 especially mothers who have been shouldering most of thefrom this pandemic in our families \u2013 out of. In January, just 39,000 women entered the labor force, compared with over 1 million men,to Bureau of Labor Statistics data.California's endemic strategy is a vital step forwardIt\u2019s unconscionable to make things even harder for us.This sense of gross individualism \u2013 the idea that people should do whatever makes them most comfortable, even if it endangers the health and social participation of others \u2013 will be toxic for our society. As a political scientist by training, I can\u2019t help but point out that in \u201cDemocracy in America,\u201d Alexis de Tocqueville famously wrote that what made America great was the spirit of the people \u2013 the way everyone banded together to solve collective problems.Lifting mask mandates will, of course, have the opposite effect. It will enable the virus to spread and make it harder to contain the pandemic. And, more broadly, it will create a society rooted in selfishness, making it harder to resolve any problem \u2013 certainly not the kind of place where I want to raise my children.Of course, politicians are likely making these decisions primarily with their public approval numbers and political futures in mind. But local school districts and private businesses can \u2013 and must \u2013 have the backbone to maintain mask mandates until vaccines are available to all.While lifting mask mandates ignores the realities of Americans under age 5 and their parents \u2013 as well as other vulnerable people who face health conditions that make the virus potentially more dangerous for them \u2013 it does evince a mindset sometimes displayed by young children that if we pretend something doesn\u2019t exist, it will simply disappear. This, unfortunately, isn\u2019t true.According to the CDC, last week,of community transmission were high in nearly 93% of US counties. We are already witnessing a high viral transmission rate at loggerheads with the individualistic urge to return to normal life: While the CDC is reconsidering mask guidance, the country\u2019s surgeon general\u201cwill my child be OK?\u201d after his own 4-year-old daughter contracted the virus.It\u2019s a question other parents like me are asking ourselves as we watch mask mandates disappear."

        "text": "Editor\u2019s Note:Kaitlyn Weaver is a Canadian ice dancer who, with partner Andrew Poje, competed in the Olympic Games in Sochi in 2014 and PyeongChang in 2018. She is a three-time World Championship medalist and three-time winner of the Canadian national championship in ice dance. She is the founder ofand a member of Skate Canada\u2019s equity, diversity and inclusion working group. The views expressed here are her own. Read moreon CNN.As a young girl growing up in the sport of figure skating, I had a dream of going to the Olympics. I also had a dream that everyone was good, honest, and did the right thing. Unfortunately, only one of those things proved true.The news coming out of Beijing comes as a surprise to few \u2013 another Russian athleteThis time, it\u2019s a minor, Kamila Valieva, but it has left the sporting world in chaos, again trying to reconcile our past and somehow wish, hope, and dream of a more just future.As I\u2019ve scaled the ranks in figure skating, my eyes have been opened to its unparalleled grace, complex and demanding technicality \u2013 and also its severe and unabashed inequities. An ethereal, beloved sport intertwined with a storied past of scandal and controversy, figure skating is as confusing as it is beautiful. Loss of faith in knowing that fair play will prevail has damaged our sport and our morale. And while Russia has laid the foundation for much of our sport\u2019s history, it is also seemingly at the root of every disparaging news headline.The question I keep asking myself is, what is it going to take to reestablish trust in our sport and in its leadership? When we consider trust in sport, safety is inherently implied. And in Olympic figure skating, safety and trust have been breached. Fair play cannot exist without trusting that these pillars are upheld, and if nations can\u2019t play by these rules \u2013 that are a part of the\u2013 they shouldn\u2019t be allowed to participate at all.This travesty of an Olympic event we are finding ourselves in has had many failures. The first was not banning Russia after the findings of systemic, state-sponsored doping during theProof of cheating, doping, switched out samples through a hole in the wall, and government funding were all found to be true. If you haven\u2019t watched the movie \u201c\u201d the depth of manipulation and threats might shock you. And I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if it makes you want to turn your back on sport altogether.The 2014 Olympics were my Games. I walked every day by the doping control station and was tested as part of ordinary protocol. To think that doping was happening under the nose of so many is deeply disturbing. And what was done about it? Not much. Slaps on the wrist that don\u2019t even leave a mark. Same people, same players, same leadership. Even(formerly of the World Anti-Doping Agency, now of the International Olympic Committee) called the Russians \u201cunrepentant.\u201dSo, here we are again, not yet with evidence that Valieva\u2019s positive test was state-sponsored, but with a positive test nonetheless. And to me, that\u2019s enough. (An IOC official familiar with the situation said Tuesday that Valieva has sought to explain the positive test as contamination from medication taken by her grandfather.)I understand that standing up to Russia is complicated and hard, but for the IOC, their responsibility is clear. It must be done.Who knows, if Russia had already been banned from the Olympic arena after its previous infractions, how many children\u2019s lives might be different today? How many Kamila Valievas are there in the pipeline who can be saved from harm?The timing of all of this is yet another failure. Valieva\u2019s sample was taken in December at the Russian Olympic Trials, so why is her positive test coming to light so belatedly, during the Olympics? If the test was reported as positive for doping a month ago, Valieva could have been removed from this event and investigations could have taken place.The fact that the news came out now, during the competition, is nothing short of tragic for all involved \u2013 Valieva, her fellow competitors who are trying their best to block this all out and just skate, every athlete in Beijing.To see Valieva\u2019s face after her performances made my heart break for her.For Shiffrin, what comes next is up to her aloneValieva should not have had to carry this weight. To me, the burden is not hers to bear. And not just about the positive test. She, like many champion Russian female skaters before her, has trained in a system known for its unyielding pressures and brutal physical demands.All of this is why I believe that in addition to the IOC stepping up to hold Russia accountable, skating\u2019s governing bodies must also develop a global checks-and-balances system, with independent officials who can travel to training centers around the world to help uphold the fundamentals of safe sport. We have to be able to trust someone.I\u2019m a three-time world medalist in ice dance, and if you don\u2019t know figure skating, basically that\u2019s code for \u201chave been taught by Russians for over half my life.\u201d Katyusha is the Russian pet name given to me by my coaches many years ago, and still follows me into the arena to this day.My criticism does not come from a place of disrespect for my friends, my contemporaries, my teachers or the rich history that Russia (and USSR) holds within figure skating. A relationship that goes back decades, Russia has alwayssetting the bar high for music, artistry and fierce competition.Controversy over gold medalist Eileen Gu skiing for China misses the pointI have the utmost and deepest respect for my sport\u2019s deep and enduring tradition. I would not be the skater I am today without the influence and impact of incredible Russian coaching. It might be difficult to find any skater or coach at the elite level in the world who has not been influenced or taught by a Russian or Russian-adjacent person.We can respect our past while still looking forward to where our future needs to be. In order to have hope for this sport, change needs to be made.\u201cWe promise to take part in these Olympic Games, respecting and abiding by the rules and in the spirit of fair play, inclusion and equality.\u201d These words must be honored, not negotiated, and if that is impossible, then sanctions must follow.Whether as athletes or fans, each of us has to deeply believe and trust that when we participate in sport, the powers that be are right and just, and willing to protect the vulnerable. Can anyone say that\u2019s what\u2019s happened here?Once every four years, the world comes together for two weeks \u2013 to drop our differences at the door, and to celebrate peace, humanity, and fair competition. If, before a skate touches the ice or a judge sits in their chair, that can\u2019t be promised, then the Olympics have no relevance anymore. And that\u2019s not something I think I can accept.I want my kids to have cereal-box superheroes, to dream about Olympic glory, and to work hard at something that they love. Without The Games, we lose A LOT as a global society, and I believe if we come together and stand up for what\u2019s right, we can move forward; but it has to start from the top, and it has to start now. The world is watching."

        "link": "https://edition.cnn.com/2022/01/26/opinions/the-future-of-covid-19-omicron-sepkowitz/index.html",
        "text": "Editor\u2019s Note:Kent Sepkowitz is a physician and infection control expert at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York. The views expressed in this commentary are his own. Viewon CNN.For the fourth time in two years, things are beginning to settle down after a terrifying wave of the latest Covid-19 variant.Though much of the country is still in the teeth of the Omicron surge, the experience in other countries, as well as the improvements seen in many US states, has led to a familiar phenomenon: various experts in infectious disease, epidemiology, public health, pandemic modeling and perhapsbeing trotted out to give their two cents on.This seems logical enough \u2013 we do need to have an idea of what to expect tomorrow and next week and beyond so that we can recalibrate our worry index, visit family we haven\u2019t seen and even plan a trip. But given the collective track record of predictions by the same well-meaning individuals (), all of these fortune-tellers should agree to provide the following disclaimer with each prediction: \u201cThough trying my best, I really am clueless regarding what\u2019s ahead.\u201dSurely this great humbling is the lesson of the Omicron variant. It broke every \u201crule\u201d of pandemic behavior we thought we had established. With unprecedented swiftness, it went from a variant of concern on November 26, 2021and now it\u2019s(and in parts of the US) \u2013 though still a growing threat in others. Also unexpected were the differences in the symptoms caused by Omicron (milder than other variants, though not mild) and the fact that Omicron partially evaded vaccine-induced immunity (thoughagainst Omicron).But after accepting that we are trapped in a phenomenon we still can\u2019t reliably predict, what else is there to do but to try and forecast the post-Omicron world?Our nursing workforce will keep crumbling if changes aren't madeHere is my prediction. There will be more surges. Some will be mild, some won\u2019t be so mild. Some will escape vaccine-induced immunity, some won\u2019t. And everyone will blame someone for something.My thinking is this: After four distinct surges, each with a lead viral variant, why would there not be five? Yes, we are a much more immune public with primed T-cells from disease or vaccine or both, but this immunity failed to blunt the Omicron surge just a few months ago. What is different now?Many turn to the story of the 1918 flu, a 15-month,, to inform their, hewing to thethat \u201cthose who do not remember the past are condemned to repeat it.\u201dBut the 1918 flu occurred in a very different moment in history: The first world war was being fought, leading to global displacement of people from here to there, death and debility on a massive scale, populations \u2013 soldiers and others \u2013 crowding together and strains on food, health care and sanity.We should leave behind any hopes based on what happened in 1918. There is no \u201cthree strikes and we\u2019re out\u201d rule in infectious disease. It turns out that the past, in infectious disease predicting, isn\u2019t so helpful. Yes, there are several old reliables for which we can anticipate everything from the start to the end:, for instance, which causes outbreaks of diarrhea on cruise ships and day-care centers, always behaves more or less the same way.  Andtypically stays within the boundaries of expected behavior. Even, though it explodes unexpectedly a few times a century, is mostly the same year after year.During my career, however, I have seen many outbreaks that were not by the book: sudden appearances of new viruses, such as HIV and hepatitis C, drastic changes in the distribution and severity of other viruses, including Zika and Ebola virus, and now the unexpected appearance of SARS-CoV-2.Parents' fury over school closures is righteous, but misdirectedThe unpredictable nature of the current pandemic is likely because it has the numbers. As Maria Van Kerkhove, the World Health Organization technical lead for Covid-19 response, said this week, \u201cThis virus is,\u201d vastly increasing its opportunities to spin off new variants. Already we are hearing of athat seems maybe a little more contagious and less easy to diagnose but otherwise pretty similar.Despite being battered by a coronavirus for two years, there is reason for some optimism. The world\u2019s herd is adding bit upon bit of immunity as people receive vaccination or become infected. Eventually, though not soon, the 7.8 billion people constituting the global herd will have enough immunity of one type or another \u2013 especially if we intensify our vaccination efforts across the globe \u2013 to dampen the reach and intensity of whatever variant is driving the wave of the moment.Indeed, though the theatrical chaos of the anti-vaxxers dominates much of the discussion in the US, it is the need to vaccinate billions of people around the world that is the key next step to subduing the relentless expansionist push of SARS-CoV-2. A year into vaccine availability,in Covid-19 vaccine distribution, a problem that can take decades to resolve, as demonstrated by the world\u2019s response to providing vaccines for other vaccine-preventable illnesses such asand.Plus, our current generation of vaccines is focused too narrowly on preventing the earliest viral variants and will need a broadening to include past, current and future, a product referred to as theThis already isalbeit with perhaps overly hopeful timelines.Even this won\u2019t be perfect either. As theof 2009 demonstrated, once in a while, a viral strain can appear that that lies completely outside our immune repertoire. The result was the H1N1 pandemic that infected about 60 million people in the US, according to estimates from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and \u2013 importantly \u2013 faded into the rearview mirror.In the meantime, we are stuck with living the new abnormal, making decisions based on today\u2019s facts, not yesterday\u2019s predictions, and doing our best to dodge whatever is coming at us."

View moreon CNN.California Governor Gavin Newsom broke new ground bythat his state would be the first to treat Covid-19 as an endemic risk. Though the word \u201cendemic\u201d doesn\u2019t mean much to most Americans, it marks an important shift in pandemic strategy.\u201cWe are moving past the crisis phase into a phase where we will work to live with this virus,\u201d.This change turns the attention of public policy toward prevention and containment. Rather than lockdowns and mask mandates, the \u201c,\u201d as Newsom has called it, adopts a philosophy of government flexibility and adaptability. The hope is that Californians can move forward with their lives \u2013 attending school, going to work, enjoying social and civic settings \u2013 but do so while prepared to aggressively tackle new outbreaks of the virus when they occur. This meansthat include the storage of about 75 million masks, continuing to raise vaccination rates, prioritizing  public information campaigns to combat disinformation, the continuation of  testing, monitoring wastewater and boosting the number of medical workers available to hospitals.Theshould be the wave of the near future. Severalhave already begun to take this approach \u2013 including Spain, France and Britain.It is a vital step. Politically, this plan allows leaders to move away from the unconstructive debates that have framed our handling of Covid-19. Politicians have vacillated between the idea of,and a middle ground of ad-hoc responses each time a new variant emerges. And, as we will inevitably see,will continue to emerge.Just as they have in the past, our policies for addressing Covid-19 into the future must begin with science. The expertise of doctors and researchers should continue to be the foundation for how we approach this deadly virus that has ravaged our nation, and the globe, since late 2019. But in formulating policy, politicians can\u2019t ignore other pressures as well. Economies need to function and civil society needs to thrive, while individuals and families need to be able to live their lives \u2013 from seeing family to attending school to gathering for meals and cultural events.The chaos from Omicron might be fading, but the turbulence ahead could be worseAs we enter another year in which the virus is very much part of our lives, the endemic framework is the only viable path forward. There has been a group of medical experts, including bioethicist Dr. Ezekiel Emanuel, who have been pushing the administration to adopt a bold national plan. \u201cWithout a strategic plan for the \u2018new normal\u2019 with endemic Covid-19, more people in the US will unnecessarily experience morbidity and mortality, health inequities will widen, and trillions will be lost from the US economy,\u201din early January, along with other top public health voices.Akin to a Marshall Plan for public health, the idea is to vastly increase the kinds of federal public health investments the government makes, like those being put in place in California. Emanuel and his colleagues, who were on Biden\u2019s transition team, became frustrated that the President wasn\u2019t moving forward with these ideas, andvia the media.Biden has an opportunity to take heed of these experts\u2019 advice and bring Newsom\u2019s \u201cSMARTER Plan\u201d to a national level. During his State of the Union Address on March 1, Biden must return to the issue that has defined the start of his presidency \u2013 aggressively and effectively tackling the pandemic so that it no longer dominates and destroys our lives. Early in his term, the President found much success with theto bolster the economy. Now, as he struggles withand several major policy challenges, from Russia\u2019s potential invasion of Ukraine to growing inflationary pressures, he can seize the moment to address how to move forward from the crisis that matters most in Americans\u2019 everyday lives. Even some of the other problems he faces, such as inflation, could be addressed by better Covid-19 policies that keep our labor force healthy and ensure that supply chains are running smoothly.Newsom announces new Covid response plan as California shifts focus to 'next phase'Though Biden has suffered through a difficult few months, he still has a chance to regain his standing in the public eye. But to do so he must provide the nation with a better understanding and a more effective set of comprehensive policies that will allow us to live our lives almost like it\u2019s 2019 again, crafted with the hard-headed realism that will allow the government to deal with a viral threat each time it flares in different parts of the country.As president, he needs to help the country see what this can look like. \u201cWe do need more national, and more coherent, national guidance,\u201d, \u201cand I think that is an imperative. One of the things you hear from everybody now, it\u2019s the communication around Covid has been less than optimal from the start \u2026 The public wants to know you\u2019re not just freelancing it.\u201dBiden has, in the past,about how we will get through these perilous times. He proclaimed in his inaugural address, \u201cWe must set aside the politics and finally face this pandemic as one nation. I promise you this: as the Bible says weeping may endure for a night but joy cometh in the morning. We will get through this, together.\u201dWhile it is certainly not clear that we will get through this together, as our political divisions run much deeper than our ability to act as one, government policy can move our nation into a place where Covid-19 looks more like the flu than a raging World War. To reach this goal, we can\u2019t depend on each state to take the right action on its own and we can\u2019t keep hoping that the pandemic will just go away.Instead, we need to learn to live with it. That means putting together a strong public health infrastructure that can support our needs while we all go back to the lives we have missed so dearly."

        "text": "Editor\u2019s Note:is a UK journalist, comedian, writer and anti-racism and equalities campaigner. She is the co-founder ofand a Labour councillor for Oxford city council. The views expressed in this commentary are her own. View moreon CNN.French lawmakers last monthwomen and girls from wearing hijab while playing sports \u2013 showing the world once again that when it comes to further politicizing, targeting and policing European Muslim women, our clothing choices and bodies, France is in a league of its own.The French Senatein favor of the ban on wearing the hijab and other \u201cconspicuous religious symbols\u201d in sports competitions. The amendment was proposed by the right-wing Les R\u00e9publicains, which argued the hijab could risk the safety of athletes wearing it while playing sports.You really couldn\u2019t make this up.In France, Muslim women using their agency, and exercising their human rights to wear what they choose to wear, is deemed a safety risk. France\u2019s attempt to apparently liberate and save Muslim women from ourselves and our headscarves is a racist and colonial project dressed up as upholding the country\u2019s secular values. The project heaps Islamophobic harm on Muslim women.Indeed, it is misogynistic and hateful to force women to remove hijab \u2013 as much as it is misogynistic and hateful to force women to wear hijab.The proposed ban isand French lawmakers expressed \u201cregret\u201d over the government\u2019s \u201clack of will\u201d to put a stop to what they describe as the \u201cdevelopment of Islamism in sport,\u201d. It comes against the backdrop of a forthcoming presidential election in April, where France\u2019s domestic politics continue to lurch further to the right, and many Muslim residents and communities of color are being subjected to.In just two years, France is also hosting the Olympics, meant to bring nations together in a united show of inclusivity on the world stage. A divisive and discriminatory hijab ban only shines a further spotlight on how ill at ease France is with building a modern multiculturalism state.The proposed law will now be revised by the National Assembly, which is expected to have the final word. All of which means that, for now, Muslim women playing sports in hijab have been given extra time to do so with the bill prevented from being passed in its current state.How mega clubs deal with sexual abuse allegations is bigger than sportFrance is home to roughly 5.7 million Muslims and the largest Muslim population in Europe,. As of 2019, 31% of French Muslim women were wearing hijab,, so this sports ban will have a profound impact on many women. Yet again, French lawmakers have chosen to continue on a dangerous collision course with the country\u2019s Muslim population and especially French Muslim women.The attempts to ban Muslim women from wearing hijab while playing sports is viewed by many Muslim women and activists I\u2019ve spoken to as taking a page straight out of the Afghan Taliban and Iranian regime\u2019s playbook by denying women their own agency. This ban is viewed as being about much more than denying women the right to play sports, if that wasn\u2019t outrageous enough.The sports hijab ban is about further dehumanizing, minimizing and erasing French Muslim women who choose to wear hijab. It makes Muslim women targets of state-sanctioned gendered Islamophobia and right-wing hate.I\u2019m one of three British Muslim women campaigners and passionate football fans calling ourselvesLast summer, alongside Amna Abdullatif and Huda Jawad, I launched a viral petition calling on England\u2019s Football Association, the British government and tech companies, to work on banning racists from football for life, following the abuse inflicted on three young Black England players after the Euro finals at Wembley against Italy.The campaign has garnered 1.2 million signatures. Within 48 hours of our petition launching, Prime Minister Boris Johnson stood in parliament committing his government to working on.Our campaign made headlines in the UK and received global media attention. However, if we were three French Muslim women, we likely would not have been permitted to enter the country\u2019s mainstream public or political space in the same way \u2013 simply because we wear hijab.This is what victory at the Beijing Games looks likeIt\u2019s a stark contrast I have experienced first-hand. In 2015, I presentedabout what it means to be young, French and Muslim in France following the Charlie Hebdo terrorist attacks in Paris. As part of the documentary, I went to the French parliament to interview Marion Mar\u00e9chal-Le Pen, France\u2019s youngest ever elected woman politician and the niece of far-right leader, Marion Le Pen.I was told I couldn\u2019t enter the parliament building because of my hijab. I explained that I was a journalist, there to interview a politician. Yes, I\u2019m a Muslim woman wearing hijab, but I\u2019m also British \u2013 \u201cI\u2019m as British as fish and chips,\u201d I told the receptionist in the hope she would understand that my hijab was irrelevant to how I do my job. The receptionist looked horrified and confused and then told me I could proceed for my interview.In Europe, there is a tried-and-tested winning formula for politicians hoping to appeal to voters on the right-wing fringes ahead of national elections. And that involves turning Muslim women and our clothing choices into a political football. Many a populist European politician in Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Denmark, Netherlands and Switzerland, and of course France, has used this tactic as a way of attracting voters. They delve into Muslim women\u2019s wardrobes and pull out hijab, niqab and burqa as exhibits supposedly threatening the very fabric of western values and way of life.In France, we have of course been here before. Multiple times. In 2004, France banned the wearing of hijab in schools alongside Christian crosses and the yarmulkes, worn by observant Jews. The ban was imposed, so the state said, on the grounds that state institutions are supposed to be \u201creligiously neutral.\u201d, France became the first country in Europe to impose a ban on full face veils, known as the niqab, in public spaces including public transport and parks, streets and administrative buildings. Women caught wearing a niqab in public space face a 150 euro fine and being arrested by the police.French lawmakers have proposed a hijab ban in competitive sports. The impact on women could be devastating.In 2016, authorities across 15 towns and municipalities across France banned the \u201cburkini\u201d \u2013 an all-in-one modest swimsuit that covers the whole body except the face. Again, the ban was imposed to supposedly uphold France\u2019s secular values.And in May 2020, when France, like many countries across Europe and the world, made face masks mandatory into try and prevent the spread of coronavirus, France\u2019s full face veil ban remained in place. Meaning, while French citizens were required to cover their faces by law, French Muslim women citizens covering their faces with the niqab continued to face the prospect of being fined and arrested by police.In 2018, the United Nations Human Rights Committee said France\u2019s ban wasand could impact Muslim women by \u201cconfining them to their homes, impeding their access to public services and marginalizing them.\u201dWhen it comes to hijab and how Muslim women choose to dress, there is widespread cognitive dissonance in the French republic, illustrated once again in fine fashion by a recenthailing actor Julia Fox\u2019s arrival at Paris Men\u2019s Fashion Week while wearing a Balenciaga trench coat, with a black headscarf, sunglasses and the caption: \u201cYes to the headscarf!\u201dThe post attracted widespread criticism from Muslim women and others pointing out the double standard of a white, wealthy, famous, American actress being praised for wearing a headscarf as a fashion choice \u2013 while a French Muslim woman choosing to wear a headscarf in her own country faces restrictions on her life choices and movements and possibly being fined and criminalized by the state. Vogue France later deleted the Instagram post.This is the hypocrisy that France must grapple with. Denying Muslim women our rights in the name of upholding so called neutrality is a fig leaf for further mainstreaming anti-Muslim bigotry and misogyny against Muslim women. French Muslim women are simply not standing for it anymore, and neither are many more Muslim women outside of France. We are collectively calling time on this racism and Islamophobia.Football and sports belong to all of us \u2013 however we choose to dress. Let Us Play."

The views expressed here are his. Read moreon CNN.We\u2019ve officially hit peak Covid absurdism.It\u2019s hard to remember that it hasn\u2019t even been two years since the pandemic \u2013 and all that came with it \u2013 befell us.That\u2019s because it\u2019s been a singular, all-encompassing experience. Generations hence, they\u2019ll talk about us like we talked about the generation who lived through the Depression.\u201dThey lived through the pandemic\u201d will be a shorthand to explain why we reflexively wear a mask on airplanes or ask about a restaurant\u2019s air filtration system before its menu.But one aspect of the pandemic experience that can\u2019t simply be explained by the existence of an exceedingly transmissible, deadly virus spreading between us is the sheer absurdity that it brought with it. Whether boarding an airplane withto protest mask requirements, injecting yourself withinstead of a safe and effective vaccine orbecause the President of the United States unironically suggested that it might help, the pandemic has amplified the frequency and tenor of ridiculous and sometimes alarming behavior.Nothing typifies that absurdity quite like the trucker protests now gripping Canada.In late January, a convoy of truckers in Canada headed cross-country, from British Columbia to the nation\u2019s capital in Ottawa,, which requires truckers entering Canadaor else be subjected to.The demonstration quickly grew, with thousands of people clogging traffic and obstructing the US-Canada border. A couple of weeks in to the protest, the demands of the loosely organized truckers still remain unclear. Some are calling this specific mandate \u201c\u201d while others have expanded toto end all Covid restrictions.Canada's trucker protesters aren't who Americans might thinkTo appreciate just how strange this moment is, let\u2019s go way back to before Covid-19 was a word. Many of us would have expected that if a deadly virus began to spread among us, we, as a society, would look to doctors and scientists for answers. We\u2019d demand public policy driven by their rational, evidence-based reasoning.Sure, there\u2019d be differences of opinion on a few key issues and the odd iconoclast or two who\u2019d just never come along. But for the most part, we\u2019d develop a collective approach to defeating the virus and do what needed to be done to get through the pandemic. And, let\u2019s be clear, that\u2019s exactly what a majority of people did.Yet, from the jump, echoing the then-President who hid early evidence of how bad the public health crisis was becoming seemingly to, some began to argue that \u201cthe cure,\u201d meaning precautionary health measures, was \u201c.\u201dThey pointed to the ways that lockdowns wereand school closures wereof the ability to go to, socialize with their classmates or receive the free school meals on which too many of our children rely. They argued that masks were. They resented the imposition on their lives.And, to be sure, they weren\u2019t wrong about any of these things: Each of these was a real cost of Covid-19 restrictions. It\u2019s just that the cost of viral transmission \u2013 which led to disease and death \u2013 was profoundly and obviously greater.But what began as fair disagreements started to mutate like the virus itself. Frustration with lockdowns inspired armed militiamen to storm theand allegedlyelected officials. Around the country, the fight to keep schools open during later waves of Covid-19 exploded intoagainst the very things that could keep kids in school safely \u2013.The frustration with having to wear masks in public spaces set off adult temper tantrums directed atand.And that\u2019s where the Canadian truckers come in. Their protests have spread to cities across Canada and beyond, effectively grinding to a standstill daily life in communities across the country. Now, they\u2019re impeding theone of the most active arteries for transnational commerce.Here\u2019s what\u2019s so absurd about it: The protest over Covid restrictions is now disrupting peoples\u2019 everyday lives \u2013  which is what the protest was supposedly aimed at stopping. They\u2019ve lost the plot.But perhaps it was the plot the whole time. It\u2019s impossible to divorce this moment from the sociopolitical trends that are also shrouded in absurdity \u2013 the emergence ofaround the world, the rash of proto-fascists and autocrats who\u2019ve, the salience ofthat spilled out of algorithms and into the real world in horrific ways.In that context, perhaps the pandemic wasn\u2019t the substrate for the absurdity we\u2019re witnessing, but a catalyst that simply accelerated what had already been happening.Either way, as the virus begins to ebb and we begin to imagine what post-pandemic life may hold for us, we must understand that the pandemic won\u2019t end when the virus recedes \u2013 but when the absurdity that came with it does, too."

But from the waving athletes to the male-female duos bearing each delegation\u2019s flag, there was, to be clear, also much joy to behold during the opening ceremony to these Games, which marks the first time a city has hosted both summer and winter Olympics.Just as Tokyo gave the world a somber but hopeful, Beijing\u2019s ceremony,of Oscar-nominated director Zhang Yimou, presented a more subdued pageant than we saw in 2008, with a fraction of the number of performers on the floor of National Stadium \u2013 the Bird\u2019s Nest.This is what victory at the Beijing Games looks likeGone were the 2,008 drummers that made the14 years ago. In their place was a lightshow peppered by winsome children filled with song, and most of the pageantry that followed took on a snowflake theme.Volunteers brandished large snowflake-shaped signs to bring the athletes into the stadium:\u2013 seven of which are new to these Games.  As always, the Parade of Nations gave each squad a chance to show its best face. With Tokyo 2020, the IOC began the tradition of a male-female duo carrying each flag, but for some countries \u2013 19 in all \u2013 who field just one athlete, this was not possible.American Samoa featured, who took up the legacy ofPita Taufatofua (who stayed back home in Tonga to help with disaster relief) and walked into the stadium shirtless and oiled up., a student at St. Michael\u2019s College in Vermont, carried the flag for Ecuador, becoming the country\u2019s first female athlete in a Winter Olympics.'Didn't see ourselves represented': This figure skating pair is ditching the gender norms rooted in their sportDespite good gender optics during the ceremony, gender equity in the Winter Olympics has a way to go.  While Tokyo became the first to achieve near parity along gender lines, the Winter Games, continue to lag. In Beijing,nearly 45% of athletes, a 4% increase from 2018.  Men have more events on the winter program \u2013 51 as opposed to 46 for women \u2013 and compete in the Nordic Combined, the only Olympic sport not open to women.  The large men\u2019s field in hockey \u2013 12 teams include some 300 players while the women\u2019s side will see 10 teams and just over 200 athletes \u2013 also contributes to the imbalance.In Beijing, gender stretches beyond male-female equity of representation to include more nuanced understandings of identity (and competition).  American figure skater Timothy LeDuc will become theto compete, partnering with Ashley Can-Gribble in the pairs competition.  Additionally, there will befor men and women to compete together.  While nine new gender-mixed events launched in Tokyo last summer, Beijing will build on events such as team figure skating with the debut of a mixed relay in short track speed skating, as well as mixed events in ski jumping and snowboard.But despite all of these exciting firsts, the ceremony \u2013 designed as one of the key rituals that separate everyday life from life during an Olympics \u2013 can only do so much in a moment when the world is, collectively, exhausted.  While the Covid-19 pandemic has thrown a spotlight on every ill humanity faces, from global public health inequities to disinformation and pseudo-science, the virus is but one specter haunting China.Russian leader Vladimir Putin, seated alone but not far from China\u2019s President Xi Jinping (earlierhad had a seemingly warm meeting together), stood to applaud hockey player Vadim Shipachyov and speed skater Olga Fatkulina carrying in the, rather than the nation\u2019s flag. Beijing marks the third and last time Russian athletes, some 200 strong in Beijing, will compete in this manner, serving out the end of a ban instituted for doping violations.But Russia\u2019s past doping scandals are barely a headline at this point, pushed onto one of the world\u2019s many backburners by the thousands of troops. Ukraine selected freestyle skier Oleksandr Abramenko, who won gold in aerials in 2018 and marks his fifth Olympic appearance in Beijing, and ice dancer Oleksandra Nazarova for the.Ai Weiwei: International Olympic Committee 'standing next to the authoritarians'Before competition even began, Ukrainian officialsto avoid social contact with members of the Russian team, perhaps especially in photos.  Last August in Tokyo, Ukrainian Yaroslava Mahuchikh, who took bronze in the high jump,of many back home for a celebratory photo with Russia\u2019s Mariya Lasitskene, the gold medalist in the event.The political tensions between the two countries have, without question, leaked into China\u2019s \u2018closed loop\u2019 Olympic bubble, regardless of Bach\u2019s appealto \u201call political authorities across the world [to] observe your commitment to this Olympic truce.\u201d Bach\u2019s pleas match those of just about every other IOC leader in history \u2013 including Avery Brundage, who in 1936of a boycott of the Games hosted by Nazi Germany because \u201cthe Olympic Games belong to the athletes and not to the politicians.\u201dRussia, especially, is no stranger to this kind of tension bleeding into the Olympics \u2013 sometimes quite literally. The Melbourne Olympics in 1956 saw Hungary defeat the Soviet Union 4-0 against the backdrop of the Hungarian Revolution, dubbed \u201c\u201d after Soviet player Valentin Prokopov punched Hungary\u2019s Ervin Zador in the eye in the final minutes of the game. In 1968,V\u011bra \u010c\u00e1slavsk\u00e1 noticeably averted her eyes away from the Soviet flag and anthem during medal ceremonies, protesting the Soviet invasion of her country.'An invented history': Experts unpack Putin's Ukraine fixationIn 2014 during the Sochi Olympics, Ukrainian athletes asked to wear black armbands when protests against Viktor Yanukovych\u2019s administration turned deadly, while others left the Olympics in solidarity of those fighting in the streets of Kyiv.  At that time, Bach urged Ukrainian athleteshow \u201csport can build bridges and help to bring people from different backgrounds together in peace.\u201dPutin\u2019s own relationship with the Olympic Games, too, should not be forgotten. In 2008, whether by coincidence or design, Russia invaded Georgia, taking over South Ossetia, just as the Olympics got started. Just three days after the conclusion of the Sochi Games, he seized Crimea.Whether or not those Russian troops step over the line during these Games is anyone\u2019s guess, especially with speculation that Xi has asked Putin not to take the limelight off the Olympics. Not exactly flush with friends, Putin might hold off while Xi has his party. But if not, the world that watched this Opening Ceremony might not be the same as the one that watches Closing.With that in mind, did this Opening Ceremony provide enough light, enough hope, to illuminate the dazzling quad jumps of six-time US figure skating champ Nathan Chen, who hopes to rectify his disappointing finish in PyeongChang (and is off to a good start, if his short program in the team competition is any indication)? Can we make room amidst masks and nose swabs and vaccination cards and isolation to root for snowboarder Chloe Kim, the first woman to land a front-side double cork 1080, making her to the mountain what Simone Biles is to the vault?We shall see. The most important question may not be whether we care about these Olympics \u2013 the thrill of competition on ice and snow on display mere months after the end of the Tokyo Games. It might be whether or not we have the energy to care about anything."

        "text": "Editor\u2019s Note:Leroy Chiao is the CEO and co-founder of OneOrbit LLC, a motivational, training and education company. He served as a NASA astronaut from 1990-2005 and flew four missions into space aboard three Space Shuttles \u2013 and once as the copilot of a Russian Soyuz spacecraft to the International Space Station, where he served as the commander during Expedition 10. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. View moreon CNN.Theis a shining example of international cooperation. Former Cold War and World War II allies and enemies came together to create arguably the most successful and visible international civil program which continues to endure today, after more than 20 years.Now, with tensions between theat their highest level since the beginning of the ISS, it\u2019s worth looking to the skies for a way forward on Earth.At first glance, it may seem truly remarkable that the ISS partner nations \u2013 the countries in the European Space Agency, Japan, Canada, the US and Russia \u2013 continue to work together so well, given that they often have differing views on world events and issues.But after some thought, it becomes obvious why international tension does not tend to reach the space station. Every partner has a large vested interest in the success of ISS and its continuing operations. Astronauts, cosmonauts, flight controllers and technical specialists are dedicated to its success, and are, by and large, given the necessary resources and then left alone to do their jobs.Between the international professionals on the ISS and everyone who works on the program, from flight controllers to engineers, strong friendships form. Honest \u2013 and sometimes heated \u2013 discussions take place. But the friendships endure and everyone continues to pull in the same direction.In the early 2000s, a few years after the Kosovo war, I started training for my ISS mission in Star City, outside of Moscow. Not long after I started training in Russia there were conflicts in and around the Balkans and I remember times when we would hear heavy Russian transport aircraft taking off all night from the air base next to us, bringing troops and materiel to the conflict zones.We Americans discussed these issues with our Russian friends in the training program and I learned one of the wonderful things about living in other worlds is you develop perspective. You don\u2019t necessarily agree, but you can appreciate the viewpoints of the other side.I trained in Russia every other month over the course of almost four years, before launching to the ISS aboard the Russian Soyuz TMA-5 mission. Through all of the disagreements between countries that occurred while I was actively a part of ISS, from 2001 to 2005, there were no problems at all for program operations.But in 2014, when Russia annexed Crimea from Ukraine, there was a hint this might not always be the case.In the aftermath of the annexation, condemnation from Western powers, including from the United States, prompted Dmitry Rogozin, then Russian Deputy Prime Minister, toperhaps American astronauts could find their way to the ISS via trampoline \u2013 instead of aboard Russian spacecraft.We were totally dependent on Russia for such transport back then, and it marked the first time a political leader of a partner country made a threat against another, in regard to cooperation in the ISS program. Rogozin would go on to be named director of the Russian space agency, a position he still holds today. These days, the US is no longer dependent on the Russian Soyuz for sending people and material to the ISS, after SpaceX\u2019s Dragon spacecraft broke the monopoly.In 2022 there are renewed tensions between Russian President Vladimir Putin and the West, amid the threat of an invasion of Ukraine. Since Rogozin is head of Roscosmos and a close ally of Putin, it certainly seems possible the ISS cooperation may be used as leverage to help pressure the US to moderate its position. That would be a problem.The fact is, both major ISS partners, the US and Russia, are required to keep it operating. The station\u2019s ability to operate depends on cooperation between both countries\u2019 control centers, as well as both nations\u2019 teams of specialists and crew members. If one space agency were to issue orders to the working level troops to limit or stop cooperating, the ISS would be in jeopardy.For example, orientation of the ISS is crucial for it to remain in orbit, and this requires close coordination between control centers and their assets. One side or the other can only operate for so long independently. It is something the top political leaders probably do not understand or appreciate. For technical reasons, noncooperation could literally lead to the physical loss of the station.Indeed, one of the most important things to come out of America\u2019s human spaceflight program, was the international framework which made the ISS possible. The partners involved work very well together \u2013 and set an example for other areas in international cooperation, according to awhich I helped author.From my experiences, I have the perspective to see the Russian concerns in the current Ukraine dispute, even though I firmly believe in the American position. Had the Soviet Union not fallen, how would the US feel about Canada and Mexico possibly positioning themselves to join the Warsaw Pact? Similarly, my Russian friends I\u2019m sure, can see the American perspective: That Ukraine is a sovereign nation, with the right to make its own decisions on alliances and in other matters. This, despite the fact both Russia and Ukraine are descended from the, and so to them, the lines may be more gray than black and white.The political leaders on all sides should engage each other with a good understanding of the perspectives of the others, to find a face-saving solution. Not only to keep ISS safely operating, but more importantly, for the sake of the people of the nations involved."

        "link": "https://edition.cnn.com/2022/02/16/opinions/san-francisco-rape-kit-dna-chesa-boudin-filipovic/index.html",
        "text": "Editor\u2019s Note:Jill Filipovic is a journalist based in New York and author of the book \u201c.\u201d Follow her on. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely her own. View moreon CNN.This week, San Francisco District Attorney Chesa Boudin came forward: That the San Francisco Police Department\u2019s crime lab uses DNA evidence obtained from rape kits and entered into a DNA database to try to identify suspects in other crimes.Police chief William Scottthat \u201cexisting DNA collection policies have been legally vetted and conform with state and national forensic standards,\u201d but also said the department will begin reviewing how it handles victims\u2019 DNA in light of assertions made by Boudin, who said, \u201cthis practice treats victims like evidence, not human beings.\u201d Boudin faces a June recall election and has been in conflict with police over use-of-force investigations.Police had already arrested one woman, Boudin said, for a property crime after identifying her from DNA evidence collected after a rape examination she underwent in 2016 as part of a domestic violence case. The San Francisco Police Chief has said that, if these allegations are true, he is \u201ccommitted to ending the practice.\u201dBoudin has not provided specific evidence to support his claim. And, Tuesday, during a news conference, he declined to provide more details and did not specify whether the woman arrested for the property crime is a victim or an alleged assailant in the 2016 case., this practice would violate California\u2019s constitution, and potentially the Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution, which protects against unreasonable searches and seizures.San Francisco Police will review its policies after DA claims it used sexual assault victims' DNA in unrelated investigations, chief saysWhatever is ultimately determined about the police department\u2019s lab, the damage may already be done. If rape survivors believe that the evidence collected in their rape kits could be used against them, that\u2019s one more reason on an already-long list to not trust the criminal justice system \u2013 or seek justice at all.What\u2019s so gutting about these allegations is that their very existence may be enough to deter some victims from reporting and getting the care they need. Many people only read headlines and soak up the top lines of various news stories, skimming over the details. And the top line here is: Police can use your rape kit DNA to prosecute you for future crimes. Even if that\u2019s not exactly what\u2019s happening \u2013 or even if it has been happening, but San Francisco puts a stop to it \u2013 that will be the takeaway. This is not an easily correctable mistake. It could have a long tail of repercussions.It\u2019s worth asking, too, how the San Francisco Police Department is using its resources. While the department was allegedly using rape kit DNA to find the perpetrator of a property crime,was a measly 12.1% last year, according to department figures \u2013 meaning the perpetrators of close to nine out of 10 reported rapes in San Francisco were never arrested, let alone convicted or taken off the streets. That\u2019s a rate far lower than the (also shamefully low)of 32.9%, according to FBI data. San Francisco\u2019s rape clearance rate is lower than the clearance rates in other large cities includingand.The question we should be asking about violent crime in American citiesAt a deeper level, it\u2019s also crucial to acknowledge that trust among rape survivors in law enforcement was, in many parts of the country, already on very fragile ground. The effects of these allegations from San Francisco will likely be felt in every single one of those communities as well.We know that rape is already, with close to 80% of rape survivors never going to the police,a Justice Department analysis of violent crime in 2016. That suggests thatwho reported rapes to the San Francisco police last year are likely a tiny fraction of the number of actual rape victims. And even that small minority still overwhelmingly does not see their cases cleared.A number of police departments and crime labs also routinely mismanage or deprioritize rape cases. In California,are sitting untested. Rape survivors who report their assaults are often disbelieved, questioned inappropriately and treated callously.For example, afound that police departments across the nation over routinely categorize rapes as \u201cunfounded\u201d after having done no detective work at all, or because they believe a victim didn\u2019t fight back hard enough. This is a national problem: In Baltimore County, according to this investigation, 34% percent of rapes were categorized as \u201cunfounded.\u201d In Oxnard, California, it was 54%. In Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, 30%.Victim: Destroying my rape kit tells me I don't matterA spokesperson from the Baltimore County Police Department told BuzzFeed News they defended their decision to label the cases as \u201cunfounded\u201d and that, while they look at every rape report seriously, they\u2019re constrained by the narrow language of Maryland\u2019s rape law.The Baltimore chief of police, saying it wasn\u2019t true that police didn\u2019t investigate rape claims at all. In 2017, Marylandin response to the BuzzFeed investigation, removing the requirement that rape victims fight back. In Pittsburgh, the police chief responded to the BuzzFeed story by telling WESA, Pittsburgh\u2019s NPR station, \u201cBased on our research, it appears (Pittsburgh\u2019s statistics) are higher than some and lower than some.\u201d He continued, \u201cIt\u2019s difficult for us to compare our stats to other agencies, as we can\u2019t speak for them.\u201dA 2016on the Baltimore Police found officers within the sex crimes unit claiming that all of their rape reports were false, and a prosecutor calling one victim a \u201cconniving little whore\u201d in an email to a police officer \u2013with a laugh and \u201cI feel the same.\u201d The then police commissionerthat \u201cThe challenge of interacting respectfully with victims of sexual assault is a challenge to our profession.\u201d Without disputing the Justice Department\u2019s findings, he said that when it comes to treating victims with respect, \u201cwe are getting better at it in Baltimore, and we are paying attention to it.\u201dAnd police officers have beeneven when they are violent criminals themselves \u2013 so long as their victims were women they were married to, or children in their care. A 2019 investigationfound that close to 40% of police officers statewide charged with domestic violence crimes were able to plead their cases down to lesser misdemeanor offenses that, crucially, allowed them to keep their guns.Many also kept their jobs, despitethat rates of domestic abuse may be higher among police officers than in the general population. (The officers interviewed for the investigation denied committing acts of abuse, and several departments declined to comment; one denied the allegations that they didn\u2019t take domestic violence charges seriously, and another said that in the case in question there was no conviction and therefore little the department could do).And those are the cases where cops are actually charged. Many domestic violence incidents are. And it stands to reason that the numbers are even lower when the abuser is a cop \u2013 who do you call when the violent criminal abusing you is a law enforcement officer?The allegations out of San Francisco are abhorrent, and if they\u2019re true, it\u2019s laudable that the DA is dealing with them swiftly and that the police chief has pledged to look into them. But none of that will change the fact that using rape kit DNA to prosecute rape victims for other crimes is simply one drop in a sea of injustices that sexual assault and domestic violence survivors face at the hands of the very people the public pays to for protection.It\u2019s on every district attorney and every police department the nation over not just to correct the most egregious mistreatment of evidence, but to correct the egregious and systemic mistreatment of rape and domestic violence survivors police are sworn to serve and protect \u2013 including rooting out criminal offenders and dangerous misogynists from their own ranks."

She is featured in CNN\u2019s new Original Serieswhich reexamines the life and legacy of the Hollywood bombshell. The four-part series premieres Sunday, January 16, at 9 p.m. ET. The views expressed here are her own. Read moreon CNN.It\u2019s vanishingly difficult forto be seen as an actual human being. Not after this many decades of being a symbol, a sex goddess, a blonde bombshell or a candle in the wind. As author Sarah Churchwell, whose bookhas said, \u201cWhat we think about Marilyn is what we think about women.\u201d In the 1950s, that proved to be a damning indictment.Given her tragic barbiturateit\u2019s easy to dismiss Monroe as a victim without the coping mechanisms for success. But these are only partial truths at best, aided by decades of rumor, mythmaking and assumption about the woman herself.Monroe was consistently typecast as vain and stupid for using her looks to her best advantage. She suffered sexual assault andthough it fell more or less on deaf ears. She lived a life that was singular and extraordinary, but women continue to identify with her. While I was being interviewed for the making of this documentary, I at one point found myself unexpectedly wiping tears from my eyes as I spoke about Monroe. The feeling of kinship we feel with Monroe is, in part, what I suspect has led so many people to find her a source of continuing fascination.Monroe\u2019s body, face and hair are cultural objects and commercial vehicles. She knew it back then, too. Today, they are also vessels of ideology about feminism, sex, Hollywood and #MeToo. With all of that baggage, her actual life can sometimes feel blotted out, overpowered by the force of her own star power. Even her films \u2013 and many of them are truly great, includingand\u2013 are sometimes sidelined in favor of the screen goddess image.'In walks the most gorgeous young girl': The moment Marilyn was discoveredBornto a single mother who was institutionalized for mental health problems, the girl who came to be known as Marilyn Monroe was raised in a series of foster homes. By the time she hustled her way to the movie backlot \u2013 and made it into her first truly noticeable parts in a one-two punch of films in 1950 (and) \u2013 she had done a lot of fine-tuning.This was not a simple and stratospheric rise, but a series of stop/start events. And the image of Monroe as a peroxide-haired bombshell did not spring forth fully formed. She was a very willing participant in the process of her star-making, from her name change to her dye job, her \u201cJell-O on strings\u201d walk to the perhaps apocryphal story that she put marbles in the tips of her bra for added sex appeal. Monroe understood how to maximize her star potential. She worked with a personal makeup artist, Allan \u201cWhitey\u201d Snyder and agreed to a staggering range of promotional gimmicks at the behest of her studio.Hear Marilyn's response when confronted about a nude photoshootNo matter what came her way, she was canny, ambitious and self-starting: far from the \u201clittle girl lost\u201d clich\u00e9 so often attached to her. In 1952 for instance, the discovery of Monroe\u2019s nude Playboy photoshoot threatened to hobble her climb to the top. The team of publicity men at 20th Century Fox insisted the photos would ruin her career, but Monroe \u2013 wisely \u2013 got out in front of the rumors. She openly admitted it was her and explained the reason was simply she was about to be evicted at the time and needed the money.It was a calculated risk, and it paid off: instead of ruining her career, the scandal poured rocket fuel on it. Mid-century America was generally a socially conservative place, but the va-va-voom powers of the pinup and the bombshell during the war years likely paved the way for a more risqu\u00e9 image of American womanhood.But Monroe\u2019s appeal was often referred to in the press with phrases that revealed the writers were usually men: things about her \u201cthree-dimensional\u201d assets and her \u201cchassis.\u201d Male journalists fawned over and belittled her in equal turn, seemingly incapable of understanding her intelligence and her looks might not be mutually exclusive. It would be decades before women journalists and writers began to truly examine Marilyn and the phenomenon around her, from Joyce Carol Oates to Gloria Steinem. But at the time, Marilyn must have felt very alone.the head of 20th Century Fox, once said all her talent was \u201cabove her navel and below her belly button.\u201dPhotographer: 'Follow Marilyn, and you'll get the shot'When she broke her contract with Zanuck and absconded to New York at the height of her popularity, she had grown fed up with the \u201cdumb blonde\u201d roles he\u2019d been saddling her with. Actors had rebelled against top-down studio system control before \u2013had rebelled against the system andwon a suit against Warner Brothers in 1943, extending her contract with them continually. But taking a stand against a powerful studio was still a huge gamble, and often a tough one to win. The moguls tended to take it personally.When, in 1954, Marilyn announced the founding of Marilyn Monroe Productions, Zanuck panicked and suspended her contract, but she refused to come crawling back. Instead, she called his bluff, knowing just how popular she was with audiences, and refused to return until major changes were made to her contract with 20th Century Fox.How Marilyn took the male-led film industry and flipped it on its headRemarkably, by 1955, she won her battle with 20th Century Fox. Fox upped her salary and offered her script, director and even cinematographer approval on each of her films with them. This was essentially unheard of for the time, proving yet again that Marilyn authored her image and her career far more than the domineering men in her life.Maybe the turning point in our understanding of Monroe was best explained by Gloria Steinem, second-wave feminist icon and founder of Ms. Magazine. In a 1986 essay calledSteinem writes, \u201cMost of all, women readers mourned that Monroe had lived in an era when there were so few ways for her to know that these experiences were shared with other women, that she was not alone.\u201dFor many women, Monroe represents a wound that never quite heals, and her quests to carve out her own identity and to be \u201ctaken seriously\u201d are still a nagging thought in so many of our heads. Yet the buoyant defiance of her roles in films, likewhen her character says, \u201cI can be smart when it\u2019s important. But most men don\u2019t like it,\u201d provide us endless solace.Marilyn Monroe's life in picturesIn the final analysis, it doesn\u2019t matter much to me whether we slap the label of \u201cfeminist\u201d or \u201cproto-feminist\u201d on someone of her era. She did unquestionably pioneering things, and she was equally victimized and forced to tolerate shameless misogyny. What matters is her story and her work stand in proud monument to a deeper cultural understanding and embrace of women\u2019s agency and desire. Marilyn Monroe held great power, and in admiring her, so do we.For updates on CNN\u2019s Original Series and Films, sign up for ourEvery Monday, you\u2019ll receive insider information, including exclusive notes from the hosts and filmmakers of your favorite films and series."

Those ties frayed, but news outlets in Ukrainein on the influence of business figures and politically-connected people on the neophyte politician.Now, with the drumbeat of war sounding louder than ever with the threat the Russians could seize more Ukrainian territory, Zelensky\u2019s credentials for holding office are being increasingly looked at by a nation nervous about the days and month ahead; questioning whether the former comedian will succumb to pressure to capitulate to awhich was inked before he was voted into office.And it could threaten the legacy of a manduring his election campaign to end the war in eastern Ukraine. It was a monumental pledge and one which likely helped him to defeat former President Petro Poroshenko.Indeed, bruised badly by Zelensky\u2019s win, Poroshenkothe Russian government would welcome the election of a \u201cnew inexperienced\u201d president of Ukraine who could be returned to Russia\u2019s sphere of influence.Putin confronts the mud of UkraineThere have been other unmet pledges from Zelensky, such as not running forof office and not cracking down on corruption in the.Fast-forward more than two years after his election victory, and Zelensky has clearly shown he hasn\u2019t checked his bag of showmanship tricks at the doors of the presidential building.Whether the policy to gift smartphones to seniors will be transformative is questionable. Elderly people in Ukraine tend to use simple flip phones rather than smartphones, and pensions(about $80 a month) even a discount is unlikely to get them into an online environment. An estimated three million Ukrainianswhere there is no internet connection.The smartphone announcement appeared out of place for a president facing war on his doorstep. Indeed, afrom the Razumkov Center, a local nongovernmental public policy think tank, found more than 55% of respondents did not believe the Ukrainian government was making enough diplomatic and defense efforts to prevent a full-scale Russian invasion. Of the 1,206 people interviewed across Ukraine (excluding the Crimea, Donetsk and Luhansk regions), more than 55% also believed Zelensky would not be an effective commander-in-chief and organize the country\u2019s defense, in the event of full-scale Russian invasion.Gunshots rang out as CNN gets first look at standoff in East Ukraine\u201cBoth Zelensky and his administration are paying the price for the mistakes they made in the past couple of years,\u201d Olga Rudenko, chief editor of the English-languagenewspaper, said at aThursday evening.\u201d I think if the invasion happened in 2019, a couple of months after he was elected president when his trust level was very high, it would\u2019ve been a different story.\u201dZelensky\u2019s mixed messaging on the threat from Russia has also failed to inspire trust in his presidential capabilities, said Rudenko. She pointed to alast month in which Zelensky said, despite dire warnings from Washington about the threat of an imminent invasion, Ukrainians should go about their lives as normal, including celebrating Easter holding barbecues. But then the very next day, in a, Zelensky said Kharkiv, Ukraine\u2019s second-largest city, could be occupied.\u201cThat was completely tone-deaf to the situation, and done in a very patronizing tone\u2026 As a Ukrainian he is failing me personally from a communication point of view,\u201d Rudenko said. \u201cWe don\u2019t know what to believe.\u201dZelensky is of course the latest in a long line of big and small screen showman who have made the professional leap into politics, the most obvious being Trump. But let\u2019s not forget the B-list actor Ronald Reagan and original Terminator Arnold Schwarzenegger. In Europe too, France\u2019s far-right television pundit Eric Zemmour is a presidential hopeful this year. And long before he was British Prime Minister, Boris Johnson madeon the satirical panel show \u201cHave I Got News for You,\u201d as a journalist.If there is one quality which seems to unite most showmen-turned-politicians it is they have a knack to shake off scandals. Even Johnson has, at least temporarily, managed to change the channel on damaging coverage of hisby focusing on the Ukraine crisis and traveling to its capital. He\u2019s the first British leader to do so in over two decades,to boost the Ukrainian government\u2019s ability to quash corruption and achieve energy independence.But whether Teflon will spare Zelensky from potentially fatal booby traps laid in front of him by his predecessors and international diplomats remains to be seen. Many here see the\u2013 hammered out in the Belarusian capital in a bid to end the conflict in eastern Ukraine \u2013 as extremely flawed, with conditions not in Ukraine\u2019s favor. (Which could also be why Putin is so enthusiastic for the accord).Should Zelensky follow through on a requirement in the accords toto Russian-backed combatants who have occupied eastern Ukraine since 2014, it could spell the end of his presidency. It is a no-go zone for any Ukrainian president because of the perception a huge piece of sovereign land would be handed over to Russia in return for very little.Now, with Ukraine facing one of the most existential challenges in the country\u2019s modern history, Zelensky must pull more out of the hat more than smartphones and resist responding to a quickly-fading TV aura by prosecuting his main opponent (Poroshenko). If there was ever a time for him to resist stunts and summon up a statesmanlike style of leadership, this is it. For Ukrainians, and the world, this is no laughing matter."

Read moreon CNN.A giant Chinese knot symbolizing fortune and unitythe athletes who paraded into Beijing\u2019s Bird\u2019s Nest for the Closing Ceremony of the 2022 Winter Olympic Games.For an athlete who hasn\u2019t won a medal, such as Jamaican bobsledder Rolando Reid, whose team28th, carrying the flag provides a special moment, but it is one enjoyed by medalists, too, such as Canadian speed skater Isabelle Weidemann, whoBeijing with one in every color.The ups and downs of the Olympics might best be understood through the eyes of bobsledder Elana Meyers Taylor, who carried the American flag, wearing a navy face mask which could barelyher grin.  She was, of course, selected to be the flag bearer in the Opening Ceremony, but a positive COVID-19 test kept herto a hotel, watching the festivities on television.While Meyers Taylor was left to lift weights in her room, her competitors got in early training runs. Her Olympics, however, turned out just fine, clearing Covid protocols in time for her to take silver in the inauguralof the women\u2019s monobob and bronze in the two-woman bobsled.  With five career medals, she now stands as the most decorated female bobsledder, the oldest American woman to win a medal in the winter, and the mostBlack athlete in Olympic Winter Games history.Covid sidelined some athletes, to be sure, including American skater Vincent Zhou, who announced his withdrawal from the men\u2019s individual event in a gut-wrenching Instagram. But Beijing\u2019s \u201cclosed loop\u201d \u2013 in which athletes, officials, and media lived behind impenetrable barricades and endured daily swabs and temperature checks \u2013 ensured that by Closing Ceremony, the infection rate of The Games hovered around 0.01.  Beijing was, according to IOC President Thomas Bach, \u201cone of the safest places on this planet,\u201d with just one positive test of the almost 70,000on the final.But as Russian troops continue to aggressivelyon the border of Ukraine, the war against Covid-19 is just one the world faces. The ancient Olympics served as a means to interrupt the conflicts of warring Greek states,by the spirit of ekecheiria, or truce so spectators and athletes could travel to and from The Games in peace.My Olympic figure skating dream came true. Don't let others get ruinedIn Beijing, however, a hug between Ukraine\u2019s Oleksandr Abramenko, who marked his fifth Olympic appearance, and Russia\u2019s Ilia Burov, silver and bronzein men\u2019s aerials respectively, defied Ukrainian officials who warned athletessocial contact with members of the Russian team, especially when photographers were around.Just as a few weeks of sport did little to convince the ancient Greeks to lay down their weapons, Ukrainian athletes may wonder what they will return home to see. Sledder Vladyslav Heraskevych finished a run by holding a sign which\u201cNO WAR IN UKRAINE,\u201d an ostensibly political act the IOC turned a blind eye to, but it has been impossible to ignore Russia at any moment of these Games.Indeed, Vladimir Putin\u2019s aggressions toward Ukraine are not much different from the country\u2019s medal haul in Beijing, despite the fact the country is still serving out an Olympic ban because of systemic state-sponsored doping. Russian athletes, without their flag or anthem, have been allowed to compete throughout the \u201cban,\u201dthey pass drug tests.  Putin not only attended the Opening Ceremony, he stood and cheered as the Russian athletesthe stadium under the flag of the Russian Olympic Committee.During the Closing Ceremony, the continuously puzzling presence of the Russians got in one last word, with Alexander Bolshunov and Ivan Yakimushkintheir respective gold and silver medals in the men\u2019s 50-kilometer cross-country race (shortened to 30 kilometers because of poor conditions), Tchaikovsky\u2019s \u201cPiano Concerto No. 1\u201d  replacing the banned Russian national anthem as is done whenever ROC received a medal.Absent from the Closing Ceremony was 15-year-old Kamila Valieva, whose team, led by controversial coach Eteri Tutberidze, posted a video to their Instagram story of the young skater back on the practice ice in Russia, appearing as though it was time for business as usual, rather than reflection on what went down in Beijing.There is no protection for a so-called 'protected' athlete like ValievaThe saga of the young skater, who competed despite a positive drug test, overshadowed much of the skating competition. While the IOC insisted on \u201cquiet diplomacy\u201d while the world demanded the safety of missing tennis star Peng Shuai, who largelyfrom public life in, the organization\u2019s president, Thomas Bach, made uncharacteristic comments regarding Valieva\u2019s implosion during the women\u2019s free skate, and the \u201cchilling\u201d \u2013 his word \u2013she endured from Tutberidze when she came off the ice. Tutberidzeshe was \u201cat a loss\u201d over his comments.The image of Valieva standing alone on the ice moments before her music began and the ensuing tumbles would take place, a look of terror in her eyes, a bottom lip that appeared chewed with worry, forced to deal with the consequences of the choices those around her likely made, remains one of the starkest of these Games.Her story bled into the entirety of the women\u2019s competition, perhaps especially seen in the competition\u2019s: Gold medalist Anna Shcherbakova stood alone, seemingly shocked by the outcome and with no vibe of victory visible, as her entire team focused on the fallen Valieva and an angry Alexandra Trusova, who likely figured her five quads would ensure her the top spot.Despite a timid hug offered by Japan\u2019s Kaori Sakamoto \u2013 thrilled to have broken into the predicted Russian sweep with her bronze medal \u2013 Shcherbakova\u2019s face, her solitude, in what should have been a moment of joy at a life\u2019s dream finally being accomplished, reminded us again these are not normal times, and this is an Olympics taking place on a grim landscape, in a moment of global exhaustion.The question remains, then, as to what comes next.  It is not just the well-known Russian skating machine that failed its athletes, or even the Olympic movement thatto allow Russia as much leeway as it needs to land 32 medals despite serving out its ban.It is all of us, anyone who watched Sherbakova stand there, alone: We are letting this happen, right in front of us, out in the open, just as we are watching Russian troops assemble on Ukraine\u2019s borders.  Sport has, again, provided us with clarity as to what is happening in the world, with the avaricious corruption of young female skaters front and center.In four years, the world, or at least those with prowess on ice and snow, willin Italy, with Cortina d\u2019Ampezzo and Milan serving as host.We will watch in hopes of having the moments that make us happier than we thought we could be: snowboarder Chloe Kimafter laying down her gold medal run, pairs skaters Han Cong and Sui Wenjing findingon home ice by just 0.63 of a point, cross-country skier Jessie Digginsafter crossing the finish line for silver in the 30 km, just hours after suffering from food poisoning, and the continued rivalry in hockey between the US and Canada. At the same time, we will understand that moments such as a lost and alone Sherbakova or a confessional Mikaela Shiffrin, who walks away with nothing to add to her pile of victories but remains one of thein her sport, might shatter our hearts.That is the shambolic wonder of the Olympic Games, reinforcing our good, while ensuring the bad is never out of sight."

        "text": "2017 was a year when discussions of press freedom and the media\u2019s choices reached a new level of intensity.White House briefings, presidential tweets and rallies critiqued the media.Journalists pushed back, while engaging in lively debate about the ways they approach their work.And, perhaps fittingly, the year is about to end with the release of \u201cThe Post,\u201d a Steven Spielberg film, starring Meryl Streep and Tom Hanks, that retells the story of how an administration tried, and ultimately failed, to stop newspapers from printing a damning government report about the Vietnam War.Despite the news coverage, the Hollywood treatment and the millions of words of commentary about these issues, just how much do most of us truly understand about why journalists do what they do and why the Constitution affords protection for free expression?In response to that question,by 26 leading thinkers and writers on the history of press freedom and the challenges the media face today in America and around the world.In these essays, authors explore how press freedom protects everyone who is active on social media and empowers people to question and ultimately strengthen the institutions that deeply affect our lives.They show how dictatorship flourishes when the press is silenced. They explain why America\u2019s free press is a model for the world. They describe what happened when a US president stopped the publication of articles about a study that delved into the government\u2019s role in conducting an unpopular war. They demonstrate how past administrations have worked to moderate the natural conflict between the White House and the press.They examine how to combat false information on social platforms and why the term \u201cfake news\u201d obscures more than it reveals. They recount why conservatives lost faith in the mainstream media and what happens when the press gets it wrong. They delve into the challenges facing the media today, from information overload to rebuilding trust with skeptical audiences.We believe these views offer a good foundation for framing the debates that will no doubt endure into 2018 \u2013 and beyond.Brian Stelter:Frank Sesno:Adam Schiff:Emily Bell:Joel Simon:Diane and James Foley:Christian Amanpour:SE Cupp:Julian Zelizer:Jonathan Peters:Sonja West:RonNell Andersen Jones:Jiang Xueqin:Mikhail Fishman:Rafia Zakaria:Hossein Derakhshan and Claire Wardle:David Gergen:W.

        "text": "Editor\u2019s Note:to get our weekly column as a newsletter. We\u2019re looking back at the strongest, smartestof the week from CNN and other outlets.\u201cThe unendurable is the beginning of the curve of joy.\u201dSo says one of the characters in Djuna Barnes\u2019s 1936 modernist novel \u201cNightwood,\u201d set in the 1920s and defined by the intense grief, alienation and passion of its characters. It\u2019s the disjointed tale of exiles seeking a place to belong and characters who talk past one another. The words they speak to each other are both emotionally horrifying and wickedly funny; without being obvious about it, Barnes uses them to question the possibility of a common language for reality, for what human beings desire \u2013 and to challenge what makes us human at all.Is any of this sounding like 2021 to you yet?With one unendurable, joyful year coming to an end and another one before us, this week we\u2019re looking back to highlight some of the top social commentary and cultural criticism that helped us look hard into the darkness, bridge the gaps between us and sometimes, take hold of the light.2021 began with political upheaval and violence. But as the world looked on at President Joe Biden\u2019s inauguration in January, poet-turned-cultural-icon Amanda Gorman read \u201cThe Hill We Climb,\u201d and reminded us that poetry is, in the words of Audre Lorde, \u201ca vital necessity of our existence\u201d that galvanizes \u201cour hopes and dreams toward survival and change, first made into language, then into idea, then into more tangible action.\u201d, poet laureate of Alabama, invoked Lorde as sheto Gorman for affirming her \u201cbelief that art is the thing that has and will keep saving us \u2026That quality of light where hopes and dreams can live is what this country needs.\u201dMore on the power of poetry::In October, controversy erupted over comedian Dave Chappelle\u2019s Netflix special \u201cThe Closer.\u201d Critics blasted it as homophobic and transphobic and called for its removal; defenders cried \u201ccancel culture.\u201d Any claim that Chappelle is a victim of cancel culture is ridiculous, wrote, who: \u201cAs a Black gay man, I exist between two communities. There is the White queer community, many corners of which are steeped in racism, and the Black community, which sometimes reeks of homophobia. The Black gay community falls in between. Both communities can be equally delusional in their bigotry and often exalt public figures who veil their dogmatism as \u2018art\u2019 \u2026 That\u2019s not to say Chappelle doesn\u2019t have a right to run his mouth. On the other hand, viewers also have the right to react. It cuts both ways, but it\u2019s critical to remember that unlike the communities who bear the brunt of his jokes, Chappelle is in no way powerless.\u201dWeeks later, in the shadow of high-stakes judicial uncertainty about the future of Roe v. Wade, Cecily Strong took on the role of Goober the Clown and talked about her \u201cclown abortion\u201d on \u201cSaturday Night Live.\u201d The skit was comedic greatness, wrote, who said as long she lives in a country where abortion is judged and restricted,on the video of Strong: \u201cIf it\u2019s true what Cole Porter wrote, \u2018Be a clown, be a clown, all the world loves a clown,\u2019 then maybe we should use clowns to give a voice to other women whose stories we don\u2019t feel comfortable talking about. Think about it. Rufie the Date Rape Clown. Boobie the Breast Cancer Clown. Reese the Restraining Order Clown. Shari the Sharia Law Clown. Melanie the Menopause Clown. Penny the Gender Pay Gap Clown who only makes 80 cents for every dollar Bozo makes. Where are the clowns? Send in the clowns.\u201dMore smart takes on cancel culture::::Why do we keep going back to a particular world created for us on the page, or on the screen? Many of us are looking for heroes. Sometimes, we want superheroes \u2013 and they\u2019re everywhere. For that, we can thank one of the most pivotal \u2013 and overlooked \u2013 artists of the 20th century, wrote. Jack Kirby, creator of the 1976 \u201cEternals\u201d comic that was adapted for the big screen in 2021, was \u201cfoundational to the success of the Marvel Cinematic Universe as it currently exists\u201d and his artistic influence \u201cin virtually all forms of visual media and art, from film to advertising to photography.\u201dOther times, we want more than a hero.andcontended that\u2019s what the wildly popular series \u201cTed Lasso\u201d provides. Rejecting the common critical reception of Jason Sudeikis\u2019s character as a paradigmatic \u201cnice guy,\u201d they: \u201cThe show\u2019s tension and success stem not from its oft-touted emphasis on kindness, but from its ability to embody something that in the past would have been called caritas\u201d \u2013 a concept of love that is drawn from early Christianity, although it\u2019s not exclusively religious. Caritas \u2013 like \u201cTed Lasso\u201d \u2013 \u201creminds us that there\u2019s a world possible in which people can count on one another.\u201dHeroes can be unexpected.wrote that one of the biggest on-screen surprises for her in 2021 was realizing that Nicolas Cage\u2019s character in the movie \u201cPig\u201d is an everyman. She, \u201cWe\u2019re all living in a time of unparalleled anxiety and sadness. What better time for a little movie about a man, a swine and the unbearable weight of grief? Are we not all in some way Robin Feld (Cage\u2019s character), struggling out of the wilderness with unkempt beards and dirty faces, squinting at civilization like it\u2019s a memory we\u2019ve long forgotten, trying to get back something invaluable that we\u2019ve lost?\u201dreminded us that who gets to be the hero is inherently a question of power. Analyzing the response to the Netflix series, \u201cThe Chair,\u201d shethat viewers who criticized this fictional show as an unrealistic portrayal of academe were falling prey to a problem she sees in her classroom: an inability to treat female characters of color as protagonists in their own stories.\u201cColin in Black & White,\u201d the docudrama about Colin Kaepernick\u2019s youth and rise to prominence, for showing the world a hero-in-the-making that would have helped his own younger self find peace in his own skin \u2013 and still has the capacity to offer that to others seeking \u201ctheir own ways to become more conscious of their racialized place in the world.\u201dMore insight for your binging pleasure:for::::::Amid a m\u00e9lange of weather disasters \u2013 hurricanes, wildfires, punishing heat waves in the Pacific Northwest and floods in Asia and Europe \u2013 the world community came together, first with a dire report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in August and then at the COP26 conference in Glasgow in November, to bring home the reality of climate change., working with, documented how this global crisis is also playing out in the lives of everyday people and: \u201cIs anywhere safe from the climate emergency?\u201d They interviewed Americans fleeing climate change on the coasts and explored one Midwest city, Duluth, that is becoming a climate safe haven.Scholarshowing how the existential threat of climate emergencies has distorted the mental health of young people. One of them told her: \u201cClimate change (has) narrowed my imagination and stolen my future.\u201dtook Richard Branson and the billionaires launching themselves into space to task for \u2026 well, a lot of things, but especially for the potential climate impact of their efforts. \u201cWhether the environmental impact of such trips is offset or not \u2013 let\u2019s hope they are \u2013 this feels like a weird moment for the richest people in the world to direct their outrageous resources toward an endeavor with no immediate benefits to the overwhelming majority of society,\u201d she.More sharp commentary::::Gymnasts Simone Biles, Aly Raisman, Maggie Nichols and McKayla Maroney held the nation\u2019s rapt attention with harrowing testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee in September, shining a righteous light on the FBI and revealing an urgent need to do more at all levels of law enforcement to confront the violence perpetrated against women and girls across our society. \u201cThe gymnasts\u2019 words were gut-wrenching to hear, both because of the deep suffering they described and because it was clear throughout that these young women, these strong athletes, should never have had to be there in the first place,\u201d.The devastating testimony punctuated a year in which women athletes sought to transform their institutions by demanding change. In the fall, the National Women\u2019s Soccer League was rocked by allegations of sexual coercion and misconduct and a lack of accountability by league officials (some of whom resigned). Former players and current stars alike came forward to speak out, andthat to have their backs, the \u201ccall to protect players, to protect women and girls, cannot just happen among colleagues and peers and it has to be more than words. The structures that govern our world, perhaps especially our working world (and professional athletes are, indeed, workers) \u2013 from sporting federations to corporations, at institutions of higher education and on shop floors \u2013 need to strike it all down and rebuild in a way that ensures those in charge are actually practicing protection for those on the field.\u201dStars like Biles and Naomi Osaka also sparked international dialogue about the need to protect athletes\u2019 mental health as much as their physical well-being. Former elite athletedescribed her own struggle with mental health pressures and microaggressions as a woman of color,that it\u2019s \u201ctime to listen to the athletes emerging as leaders in their own right here.\u201dThe call for women\u2019s autonomy wasn\u2019t limited to the world of sports. Perhaps the most visible manifestation came with the zenith of the #FreeBritney movement: documentaries, hearings and protests culminated in Spears\u2019 release from a conservatorship that lasted more than a decade. According to, \u201cThe attention being paid to the Spears case is happening at a crucial moment: seeing a woman being freed from the control of her father, and slowly regaining full autonomy over her own life and body, isof why all women deserve the right to control their lives as well.\u201dDon\u2019t miss::::Building on decades of work by scholars, activists and community members, the 2019 Netflix documentary series, \u201cWho Killed Malcolm X?\u201d helped prompt the Manhattan District Attorney\u2019s Office to reopen an investigation into the 1965 assassination. In November, Muhammad A. Aziz and Khalil Islam (formerly Norman 3X Butler and Thomas 15X Johnson) \u2013 who each spent more than 20 years in prison \u2013 were exonerated after the investigation found the FBI and New York Police Department withheld evidence that could have been pivotal.(who was an on-air historian for \u201cWho Killed Malcolm X?\u201d), \u201cThese new revelations about the corrupt investigation into his death helps us to better understand why, in life, Malcolm emerged as a relentless critic of the justice system\u2019s mistreatment of Black America \u2026 (His) legacy continues to haunt America\u2019s criminal justice system in ways that are both sobering and hopeful.\u201don other hauntings, noting that on \u201cApril 20, the same day that a Minneapolis jury found former police officer Derek Chauvin guilty of murdering George Floyd almost a year before, the Library of America released a long-lost novel that began with White policemen beating and torturing an innocent Black man into confessing to a double murder he didn\u2019t commit.\u201d \u201cThe Man Who Lived Underground,\u201d by \u201cNative Son\u201d author Richard Wright, was unpublished for 80 years. But the novel, according to Seymour, \u201ctriggers instantly recognizable parallels \u2026 (but) however much the criminal justice system is reformed in the wake of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor and other casualties of excessive policing, it\u2019s really the renewed insistence on humanity prompted by their killings that Wright anticipates with his novel.\u201dJust days after the first anniversary of George Floyd\u2019s murder, the country observed another sobering milestone: the 100th anniversary of the 1921 Tulsa Race Massacre, in which the city\u2019s Greenwood neighborhood, known as Black Wall Street, was largely destroyed by White mobs that killed many Black residents. \u201cIn 1921, the city of Tulsa and the state of Oklahoma failed to deliver justice to the victims and survivors of America\u2019s worst race massacre,\u201d said, whoon behalf of those seeking reparations for the massacre: \u201cThis occasion offers another opportunity to restore what the remaining survivors and the members of the Greenwood community deserve: justice.\u201d\u201cGod loves Tulsa,\u201d, pastor of Vernon AME Church \u2013 one of the few structures to survive, even partially, the destruction, and which remains a cornerstone of the neighborhood \u2013. \u201cI would say that this city is not unusual. That we all have Tulsas in our states \u2026 and justice for the most part has not been done. That\u2019s the scary part about Tulsa, it is not unusual.\u201d, whose great-grandmother Mary E. Parrish published her eyewitness account of the massacre,that Parrish \u201cadmonished the nation to awake to the factors that feed state-sanctioned violence and provided a model for capturing and preserving the truth. She knew, as did the other survivors of the massacre: Our democracy depends on it.\u201dLooking forward by looking back:::::These personal stories of how the news shapes real life and vice versa really stood out::::::::::::The pulse of 2021 was a question: What comes next? We reached new thresholds of vaccination and saw rollbacks of safety measures, but we also confronted more surges and new variants, including Delta and Omicron. And yet, wrote, Americans are primed for \u201ca new Roaring \u201920s\u201d \u2013 an echo of the decade when the rise of cities and the crackling demand for new life after World War I and the 1918 flu pandemic combined to transform culture. We hunger for the same aliveness and creativity evident in the Jazz Age and the Harlem Renaissance, she observed, but we must guard against the surges of xenophobia and hate that previewed the total economic collapse to come during the Great Depression.\u201cThat fusion of culture and politics is precisely what we should have our eyes open for,\u201d Hemmer. \u201cTo combat both a politics of exclusion and an economics of inequality, we will have to find ways to fold those into the cultural vibrancy of the coming decade.\u201ddrew parallels between Dorothea Lange\u2019s photographs of the Great Depression and our own uncertain moment. \u201cThere is something in Lange\u2019s photographic gaze that insists upon our linked fates and our common dignity, and also gives us the chance to grapple and reckon with our national scars,\u201d Taylor. Taylor urged people to use this moment to invest in art\u2019s restorative power as a public good: \u201cWhat should we make? What could we? What might it be to undertake that daring? In this moment, it feels once again urgent that we look.\u201dWe wish you joy and health this holiday season. Thank you for sharing another year with us."

        "text": "Editor\u2019s Note:Michael D\u2019Antonio is the author of the book \u201c\u201d and co-author, with Peter Eisner, of the book \u201c.\u201d The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. Viewon CNN.Given the chance, former President Donald Trump took the headline-grabbing route and declared Russian leader Vladimir Putinand his decision to roll his army into separatist-held parts of Ukraine \u201cgenius.\u201dIt\u2019s hard to know if the former President could have said anything more disturbing as Russia bullies a much smaller country. But it\u2019s certain that as he sided with America\u2019s opponent, he was being true to himself.Good riddance Nord Stream 2. Now Europe has a golden opportunityLeaders of democracies on both sides of the Atlantic havePutin\u2019s unprovoked and unjustified aggression. With his forces arrayed to Ukraine\u2019s north, east, and south, the autocrat talks about Ukraine\u2019s past status as a Russian colony as hedomestic support for war.Noting Putin\u2019s strategy of falsely calling his troops \u201cpeacekeepers,\u201d Trump told an interviewer, \u201cthat\u2019s pretty savvy.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s the strongest peace force I\u2019ve ever seen,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThere were more army tanks than I\u2019ve ever seen. They\u2019re going to keep peace, all right.\u201d Trump has long admired strength above all else, and his new comments on Putin are fully consistent with his long-professed admiration for the Russian President.He offered no words of condemnation for a regime threatening the worst military conflict in Europe since World War II. Instead, Trump violated an unwritten rule by attacking our current President as he struggled to deal with the war against one of America\u2019s friends. Since everything is apparently about him, hehe would have handled this crisis better and took a further swipe at President Joe Biden, \u201cThis never would have happened with us,\u201d said Trump who then added, that Biden is a \u201cman that has no concept of what he\u2019s doing.\u201dWorld War II is an apt reference point for anyone seeking the roots of Trump\u2019s behavior. That war had ended the year before he was born, and it had shaped his mentor at the New York Military Academy, which he attended during his junior and senior high school years.Theodore Dobias had served as an enlisted man in the allies\u2019 ferocious campaign in Italy. When I interviewed him prior to his death in 2016, hethe \u201cthe blood, the screaming\u201d remained fresh in his mind. At NYMA he taught boys to be fighters who respected strength. Trump would tell me Dobias \u201cwould rough you up\u201d as he transmitted life lessons.Somebody needs to give Putin a history lessonAs former President and current leader of the Republican Party, Trump seems to have taught his political followers to respect Putin\u2019s strength as he does. Trump\u2019s former secretary of state Mike Pompeo recentlyPutin \u201cVery shrewd, very capable\u201d adding, \u201cI have enormous respect for him.\u201d Some in Congress and in the Trump-supporting commentariat either used the moment to attack Biden or take Russia\u2019s side in a conflict Putin began when he invaded Ukraine in 2014, simply seizing control of Crimea.To be fair to Pompeo, he has alsoUkrainians as victims in this crisis, but the fact that any American leader would use this state of emergency to express admiration for Putin and to attack Biden is anathema to America\u2019s political tradition. As retired General Barry McCaffrey put it, Putin is aAny praise for him should be compared with the old observation that the fascist dictator Benito MussoliniItaly\u2019s trains run on time. (In fact, he didn\u2019t achieve this feat, but the expression has been used to justify admiration for strongmen.)If anything could be more un-American than offering praise for an authoritarian as he invades a weaker democratic nation that is friendly to the United States, it might be adding to this indecency a bit of whining about personal political concerns.Yes, in the same interview Trump repeated his Big Lie about being cheated out of reelection in 2020. \u201cWell, what went wrong was a rigged election,\u201dTrump. \u201cWhat went wrong is a candidate that shouldn\u2019t be there and a man that has no concept of what he\u2019s doing.\u201dIn addition to training much of the GOP to echo his Big Lie, Trump has led them to break with a long tradition of rallying behind the president in times of international conflict. With Bidenour military to defend NATO allies that border Ukraine, America is clearly not on Putin\u2019s side. Sadly, many prominent American politicians, led by Trump, seem to be.This current crisis is only the latest skirmish in which democracy, as represented by the US, is confronting a rising threat of autocracy. As the American-based Freedom House think tank puts it, freedom is \u201cunder pressure\u201d from around the world. Perhaps it\u2019s no surprise that Trump, who has praised dictators many times, seemsto protecting certain democracies now. It is a travesty that demonstrates, once again, that he doesn\u2019t grasp what America stands for \u2013 democracy, freedom, peace \u2013 and he is leading others to stand with him."

        "text": "Do you wonder where the 2010s went? Us too.Now here we are at the precipice of a new decade. But wait. Let\u2019s pause a few minutes before we leap into 2020 and together take one last look back at the past 10 years\u2014the political upheaval, the social earthquakes and their joys (and disappointments), the natural disasters and everyday triumphs of humanity. And the crazy cultural phenomena we knew you wanted to hear about, because who could look away? (\u201cLeft Shark\u201d? \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d? )You\u2019ve lived through this surge of history and CNN Opinion was with you, publishing commentaries by interesting people to help answer the question: what exactly does this all mean?CNN Opinion was born in the waning months of 2009 and turned 10 this year. Here\u2019s a sampling of our most memorable pieces\u2013so far. Take a look!\u2013Pat Wiedenkeller\u201cPeople are thinking \u2018I may have lost a loved one, but also I may have lost my country.\u2019 You feel so sad, terribly sad\u2026 The motto of Haiti is \u2018L\u2019union fait la force\u2019: \u2018in unity there is strength.\u2019In moments like this, you cling to that. You cling to everything. It makes me remember that this is a country that didn\u2019t have a chance when it began, a nation of slaves becoming the world\u2019s first black republic. You have to draw from this historical precedent and hope there will be a rebirth.\u201d\u2014-\u201cI had pretended to be straight and played the games most gays in the military are all too familiar with \u2013 not daring to have a picture of Lynne on my desk, being reluctant to go out to dinner with her, telling her not to call me at work except in a real emergency, not going to church together, avoiding shopping for groceries together and generally staying out of sight of anyone I knew when we were together\u2026But it was the events of September 11, 2001, that caused me to appreciate fully the true impact of \u2018don\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell\u2019 on our lives.\u201d\u2014-\u201cWashington bureaucrats are simply incapable of efficiency. The Tea Party is determined to send new, fiscally responsible leaders to Washington to trim government fat \u2013 and not with scalpels, but with chainsaws.\u201d\u2014-\u201cBy the early 60\u2019s The Pill had made it easier for a woman to delay having children until after she established herself in a career.Another significant effect of The Pill on female sexual attitudes during the 60\u2019s was, and still is: \u2018Now we can have sex anytime we want, without the consequences. Hallelujah, let\u2019s party!\u2019These days, nobody seems able to \u2018keep it in their pants\u2019 or honor a commitment, raising the question: Is marriage still a viable option?\u2026\u201d\u2014-\u201cIf the largest and most diverse generation in American history is so progressive, and members voted decisively Democratic, why the so-called \u2018Republican tsunami?\u2019Because Obama himself wasn\u2019t on the ticket.The candidates who were running had the responsibility to engage and turn out young Obama voters \u2013 and apparently completely failed to do so\u2026\u201d\u2014-\u201cWhen I was in Evin Prison in Tehran, a guard twice brought flowers to my cell\u2026When I broke down and cried, she would hold me in her arms, look me in the eyes and say, \u2018God willing, Sarah, it\u2019s going to be OK.\u2019Since my release, many people have wondered why I have not been more condemning of the country that kept me in solitary confinement for 410 days. They have wanted to know why I speak with such conviction about the need for an improved Iranian-U.S. relationship and highlight my love for the Middle East and respect for Muslim culture.\u201d\u201cThe sickening shooting spree in Tucson holds many lessons for our country, but the most important is this: It\u2019s much too easy for dangerous people to get their hands on deadly weapons. We must change this.A good start is by banning high-capacity gun magazines \u2013 which allow scores of bullets to be loaded at one time \u2013 such as the one used in the Tucson massacre that left six people dead and 14 others wounded, including my colleague, Rep. Gabrielle Giffords.\u201d\u2014-\u201cWilliam and Kate kissed on the balcony of Buckingham Palace. Heart-shaped balloons floated above the couple\u2019s heads while Royal Air Force planes performed a flyover. And, of course, the bride looked stunning.But now that the wedding is over, what are the prospects for the marriage?There are a number of social signifiers that would seem to give it a pretty good shot. This is important, because over the ages the monarchy hasn\u2019t been so successful at producing great marriages.\u201d\u2014-\u201cAs the shaking got louder, I was looking at the walls around us wobble and crackle and I became humbly appreciative of the rule-abiding mind-set projected by the thick columns of reinforced concrete.Like Californians, the Japanese have been serious about earthquakes and it was now paying off. The statistics are clear. Even though the attention is riveted on the bad news of the tsunami devastating coastal towns\u2026Considering the size of the phenomenon and of the city affected, Tokyo came through largely unscathed.\u201d\u2014-\u201cA young child slapping his or her parent\u2019s hand away in defiance is not cute, it\u2019s disrespectful. In my house, growing up, that would have earned much more than \u2018the look\u2019 from my mother.If I sound a bit old-school, I am. If I\u2019m coming across as a bit of an ogre, so be it.  As a parent, I can empathize with how difficult raising children can be\u2026But I don\u2019t believe making a child\u2019s wishes top priority is a demonstration of love. Nor do I believe that I, or the rest of the world, should act as surrogate parents for somebody\u2019s bad-ass kids.You wanted them, deal with them.\u201d\u2014-\u201cI find myself strangely untroubled by New York state\u2019s vote to authorize same-sex marriage \u2013 a vote that probably signals that most of \u2018blue\u2019 states will follow within the next 10 years.I don\u2019t think I\u2019m alone in my reaction either. Most conservatives have reacted with calm \u2013 if not outright approval \u2013 to New York\u2019s dramatic decision. Why? The short answer is that the case against same-sex marriage has been tested against reality. The case has not passed its test.Since 1997, same-sex marriage has evolved from talk to fact.\u201d\u201cRestricting access to such a basic health care service, which 99% of sexually experienced American women have used and 62% of American women are using right now, is out of touch with public sentiment\u2026Attacking me and women who use contraception by calling us prostitutes and worse cannot silence us.\u201d\u2014-\u201cToday, the day after the tragic shootings near Milwaukee, the fog will begin to lift. Just as after Columbine and Aurora, we will hear the names of the suspect and victims. We will learn more about the motive and imagine the nightmare that unfolded within those walls. \u2026But that will not be enough today.Today, we are called to do more. We are called to do the hard work of listening.\u201d\u2014-\u201cIt has been three days since Chris Stevens and three other Americans lost their lives in Benghazi, Libya\u2026What really made Chris exceptional to me\u2026was his ability to distance himself. Not the aloof kind of distancing that you might expect from someone in his position, but the kind where one puts emotion and ego aside in order to truly listen, to understand, and then to find a way to build bridges.\u201d\u2014-\u201cJail is waiting. Depressing waiting. Humiliating waiting. Pointless, tedious waiting in a crowded cage with dead roaches and no running water, where officers processing you through the system laugh at your discomfort and fear.\u201d\u2014-\u201cPeople who have visited SpaceX say its employees are among the best and brightest and that they mean to change the world. This is just what NASA did in the 1960s when humans moved out of low Earth orbit and ventured to the moon.\u201d\u2014-\u201cThe compelling story told in the film captures a lot that is true about the search for al Qaeda\u2019s leader but also distorts the story in ways that could give its likely audience of millions of Americans the misleading picture that coercive interrogation techniques used by the CIA on al Qaeda detainees\u2013 such as waterboarding, physical abuse and sleep deprivation \u2013 were essential to finding bin Laden.\u201d\u201cWhat Pope Francis seems to bring, at least at a first glance, is personal authenticity and credibility. Both are critical precursors to change. Many people want change, it is true, but any proposals that might or might not come won\u2019t mean a thing unless a new spirit of credibility and trust flows down the Tiber throughout the planet\u2019s oceans to the world\u2019s 1.2 billion Catholics.\u201d\u2014-\u201cWelcome to the end of private conversations\u2026and welcome to a world where\u2026everything else that you do or is done on a computer, is saved, correlated, studied, passed around from company to company without your knowledge or consent; and where the government accesses it at will without a warrant.Welcome to an Internet without privacy, and we\u2019ve ended up here with hardly a fight.\u201d\u2014-\u201cOn Wednesday, the United States Supreme Court heard arguments in my case challenging the discriminatory Defense of Marriage Act, widely known as DOMA. I was honored and humbled by the opportunity to have my case considered by our nation\u2019s highest court\u2026To be honest, I never could have imagined that this day would come \u2013 the day that I would be \u2018out\u2019 as an 83-year-old lesbian suing the federal government.My late wife, Thea Spyer, was, and is, the love of my life.\u201d\u2014-\u201cThis has not been a shining week for the patriarchy. The men in suits dither, posture, plan negotiation sessions and then cancel them, and employ copious military metaphors \u2013 \u2018wage battle,\u2019 \u2018refuse to surrender\u2019 \u2013 to no effect\u2026Competence, meanwhile belongs to the women, particularly in the usually macho world of global finance. Over in Europe, Merkel was re-elected on the basis of her deft handling of the eurozone crisis, and in the United States, monetary policy was entrusted to (Janet) Yellen. Making the victory extra sweet for women, she was chosen instead of Lawrence Summers, who will forever be remembered for saying women aren\u2019t that good at math.\u201d\u2014-\u201cAs you read this timeless piece of oratory, engage in a discussion with those around you on what these words mean to us today. Let us ask ourselves how it is these words have endured the test of time, especially in current times.\u201d\u2014-\u201cNever have sex with a girl unless she\u2019s sent you a text that proves the sexual relationship is consensual beforehand\u2026 Crazy, I know, but I\u2019ve actually been encouraging my son and his friends to use sexting \u2013 minus the lewd photos \u2013 to protect themselves from being wrongly accused of rape.\u201d\u2014-\u201cAs a gay man who came out the year after the Stonewall riots, I have witnessed more change than I had ever imagined would be possible in my own lifetime.\u201d\u201cThough World War I, which began 100 years ago next month, devastated lives and landscapes, its effect on language was almost paradoxically positive. It spawned hundreds of new words and popularized scores of old ones. Many of them survive today \u2013 there are \u2018cooties,\u2019 \u2018camouflage,\u2019 \u2018scrounge\u2019 and \u2018dud,\u2019 for example \u2013 but many have lost their once-widely recognized associations with the war that was hoped would \u2018end war.\u2019Total war, as the world twice found out in the past century, is a turbulent time. It is for language, too.\u201d\u2014-\u201cThe world finally is starting to wake up to the plight of the pangolin \u2013 an awesomely introverted, scale-covered mammal that\u2019s capable off fending of lions but gets snatched right up by poachers\u2026more than 1 million pangolins were poached in the last decade. That\u2019s a staggering number \u2013 pangolins already were thought to be the most trafficked mammals in the world \u2013 and an important reminder that the world could lose these amazing little creatures if more isn\u2019t done, immediately, to protect them.\u201d\u2014-\u201cI was standing in the section right outside the restroom where the comics waited to be introduced onstage. All of a sudden, the club door opened and Robin popped in. The people in charge of the club said, \u2018OK, we\u2019re putting Robin on next.\u2019 I couldn\u2019t really argue with that; he was certainly a bigger name than I was. But to my amazement, Robin told them, \u2018I have a bunch of people in the audience tonight, and I would really like to make sure they see Gilbert first.\u2019\u201d\u2014-\u201cThis tiny little loud-mouthed Jewish woman was my hero. When Joan Rivers walked through the curtain on \u2018The Tonight Show,\u2019 nobody in my house was allowed to utter a sound. Her gait was full of pep and purpose and her voice unmatched. Her first appearance was in 1965, when I was 3. Johnny Carson called her over to the couch and whispered, \u2018You\u2019re going to be a star.\u2019 She looked behind her to see if he was talking to someone else.\u201d\u2014-\u201cI would not tell anyone else that he or she should choose death with dignity. My question is: Who has the right to tell me that I don\u2019t deserve this choice? That I deserve to suffer for weeks or months in tremendous amounts of physical and emotional pain? Why should anyone have the right to make that choice for me?\u201d\u2014-\u201cI\u2019m raising a black boy to be a black man. So, the grand jury\u2019s decision seems to double down on a pattern in this country of killing black boys without care or consequences\u2026 But it was also my reality when as we sped home to relieve our sitter one night, my husband and I were pulled over by a police officer on a dark, wooded parkway in Virginia. And I watched my husband, an officer for nearly 10 years, immediately turn off the car, turn on all the interior lights, place the keys on the dashboard and put his hands on the steering wheel.\u201d\u2014-\u201cPerhaps the most delightful difference between American soaps and Spanish novelas is not just how over the top, fashionable and gorgeous the stars are; it is also that when they end after several months, evil is taken out, good always wins, and there is, for the most part, a happy ending. A refreshing way to live in a country where people want to deport you and your family!\u201d\u2014-\u201cI see it in the op-ed pages of the newspapers, and on the state ballots in nearly half the country. I see it in politicians who once preferred to play it safe with this explosive issue but are now willing to stake their political futures on it. I see the revolution in the eyes of sterling scientists, previously reluctant to dip a toe into this heavily stigmatized world, who are diving in head first. I see it in the new surgeon general who cites data showing just how helpful it can be.I see a revolution in the attitudes of everyday Americans. For the first time a majority, 53%, favor its legalization, with 77% supporting it for medical purposes.\u201d\u2014-\u201cAs the world now knows, the star of the Super Bowl was not Tom Brady or Russell Wilson. It wasn\u2019t Katy Perry or Missy Elliot. It was the Left Shark. His onstage dance during the halftime show has earned him global acclaim and, I must say, some unfair scrutiny for his seeming missteps.\u201d\u2014-\u201cWhat Jenner has done \u2013 both on a personal and a public level \u2013 is no small feat. She used her access to the media to bring attention to a community that has fought hard for many years to have its stories heard, without being sensationalized. In that way, she has brought important attention to an often-marginalized and misunderstood community, while also being true to herself. But let\u2019s also be honest: Are we praising her for her courage to be her? Are we praising her bravery as a human \u2013 or as a celebrity? Or are we, well, sensationalizing?\u201d\u2014-\u201cHe is one of 12 refugees who drowned while trying to reach the Greek island of Kos \u2013 a Syrian, according to the governor\u2019s office in Turkey\u2019s Mugla province. The photo has gone viral, often accompanied by a Turkish hashtag that translates, in English, as \u2018flotsam of humanity.\u2019 The provocative phrase \u2013 flotsam being stuff, in the plural, that washes up after a shipwreck \u2013 is meant to denounce a politics of neglect by European governments that insults migrants\u2019 and refugees\u2019 dignity.Why was this photograph selected to spark action, and why has it struck a chord in a way others have not?\u201d\u201cLater in the day, when the names of the murdered started filtering out, scenes in the street took another intensity. This became personal.Every French citizen felt as if they had lost a member of their family. I saw many tear-stricken faces that day, and for many days after. Among the 12 people killed at the French satirical weekly Charlie Hebdo, five were among France\u2019s most cherished cartoonists\u2026The killers knew how deep this would hurt.\u201d\u2014-\u201cI lost my good friend Prince on Thursday. There will be much talk about the art that he created. There will be much speculation about why he left us so soon.But right now, I just want to share eight things that people in the media \u2013 and even his most dedicated fans \u2013 may not know about him.  Prince had a secret talent that few knew about\u2026\u201d\u2014-\u201cTrump is the real life incarnation of the characters we love to watch in fictional shows. He perfected this character \u2013 the boss who \u2018tells it like it is, whose tactics make us cringe but whose results keep us hooked on what happens next \u2013 on his reality shows \u2018The Apprentice\u2019 and \u2018Celebrity Apprentice.\u2019 He fired and insulted people with an unsympathetic directness and dynamic charisma that fit into this antihero mold. We loved him not because we liked him, but we wanted to see how far he would go to get the job done.\u201d\u2014-\u201cThere is simply no rational reason to believe that we have to supply citizens with assault weapons. Any paranoid belief that such weaponry would be necessary in a government-induced Armageddon simply pales in comparison to the undeniable reality of what we might do \u2013 are doing \u2013 to each other with such weapons.\u201d\u2014-\u201cRaphina wakes up early each morning, cooks for her family, cares for her younger siblings, and goes to work at a local market \u2013 all before she even gets to school. But she still attends class each day, working especially hard in science and math so she can fulfill her dream of becoming a nurse\u2026we know that when we give these girls the chance to learn, they will seize it. They\u2019ll walk for miles each day to school. They\u2019ll study for hours every night by candlelight, determined to learn as much as they possibly can.We also know that educating girls doesn\u2019t just transform their life prospects \u2013 it transforms the prospects of their families, communities, and nations as well.\u201d\u2014-\u201cSomeday, I hope to hoist my own grandchildren onto my shoulders. We\u2019ll still look to the stars in wonder, as humans have since the beginning of time. But instead of eagerly awaiting the return of our intrepid explorers, we\u2019ll know that because of the choices we make now, they\u2019ve gone to space not just to visit, but to stay \u2013 and in doing so, to make our lives better here on Earth.\u201d\u2014-\u201cThe Republican nominee just pulled off one of the greatest upsets in political history to take back the White House. He managed to flip Rust Belt blue states red and in doing so, helped the GOP retain its majorities in Congress. As a Republican, I should be overjoyed. But as an American first, my heart is heavy. Why? Because that nominee, now President-elect, is Donald Trump.\u201d\u201cReforming health care became not just a priority but an economic imperative. Obama put his presidency on the line to achieve it. When, in the midst of an exhausting and politically divisive legislative debate, senior advisors urged the President to cut a deal and walk away, he refused. Ultimately, he signed the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, now called \u2018Obamacare,\u2019 into law on March 23, 2010. It was, by any measure, an historic accomplishment.\u201d\u2014-\u201cTrump\u2019s warmth to right-wing populist movements in Europe and hostility to trade and global institutions are wholly consistent with the worldview of Bannon\u2019s Breitbart, which recently opened bureaus in France and Germany in advance of elections there.Ten days in, this much is clear: Steve Bannon is playing a role in national security and foreign policy for which there is no precedent. And for better or worse, he already is making an impact.\u201d\u2014-\u201cI was just a child of 5 when soldiers marched up our driveway in a Los Angeles residential neighborhood, bayonets in hand, and pounded on our front door, ordering us out. We were permitted only what we could carry, no bedding, no pets.I remember my mother\u2019s tears as she and our father gathered us up, with our precious few belongings in hand\u2026That was in 1942. Earlier that year, on February 19, 75 years ago yesterday, President Franklin D. Roosevelt issued an executive order, No. 9066, which set the internment into motion.\u201d\u2014-\u201cThe US has become the most powerful nation on Earth and among the greatest in history, because it has long respected and promoted science. Countless policies, from military deployments to regulations that control the formula of a shampoo, are based on science.\u201d\u2014-\u201cI am a single mother by choice. Yet I was raised in a Christian, conservative home, where I grew up believing in the traditional family unit. And I was taught that there was an order to achieving it. First, fall in love. Second, marry a man. Third, start a family.Now in my fifth decade, only one has proven true for me \u2013 and it isn\u2019t the first.\u201d\u2014-\u201cWhat angers me most about the white supremacists who came to Charlottesville isn\u2019t just their views or their hate. It is their apparent rejection of anything complicated; their lazy belief that history is a zero-sum game with easy equivalences. They believe that if we acknowledge \u2013 by removing or contextualizing them \u2013 that many Confederate monuments were not attempts to record history as it happened but a direct effort to marginalize people of color to shape a whiter future, then we deny where they came from. They appear to think that if the world says Black Lives Matter, then white lives must matter less.\u201d\u2014-\u201cIn my own experiences with sexual harassment and assault, I have been made to feel as if I had to compromise my own convictions for the advancement of my career. I was made to believe that my talent and experience should take a back seat to my physical appearance. I was manipulated into believing I had \u2018asked for it.\u2019 And I was made to feel that if I spoke out or fought back, the repercussions would make me regret it.\u201d\u2014-\u201cPromoting and protecting a free press is a value shared across the aisle. In 2006, I founded the Congressional Caucus for Freedom of the Press with my then-colleague, Vice President Mike Pence. We created the caucus to inform our colleagues in Congress about the centrality of press freedom to human rights and economic development, and to exert pressure on countries that put journalists on trial, or worse, for the crime of telling the truth.\u201d\u2014-\u201cPeople ask me whether I need or want an individual apology from either now-President Trump or Billy Bush. Well, apologizing to me would be the appropriate thing to do. Am I losing sleep over it waiting for one? Absolutely not.I refuse to let a situation such as this one take away my emotional power.\u201d\u201cDACA was a dream come true. As an actor, it gave me the confidence to book more work and speak my mind a little louder without fear that my status would be used against me. But most importantly, it gave me some peace of mind that I wasn\u2019t going to get separated from my family\u2026I know the only real long-term solution is a legislative one.\u201d\u2014-\u201cAlthough I was young when my foster care ordeal began, I remember how it felt to be passed off and overlooked. Like nobody knew me or wanted to know me. Like my talents didn\u2019t count, and my voice didn\u2019t matter.Finding a family made me feel like I mattered. Finding a passion, something I loved and was really good at, made me feel like I mattered. Representing my country and being part of such an amazing Olympic team matters, as does being a role model for those looking to fulfill their own dreams.\u201d\u2014-\u201cThe truth is that the politicians on both sides of the aisle are to blame. The Republicans, generally speaking, take large donations from the NRA and are therefore beholden to their cruel agenda. And the Democrats lack the organization and the votes to do anything about it.\u201d\u2014-\u201cThis event \u2013 beautiful, destructive, frightening \u2013 also presents a moment for all of us to appreciate the immense power of the forces that never cease shaping our planet. We are reminded by Kilauea to stay humble in the face of nature. And for volcanologists, the eruption is an opportunity to share with the public what we know about how these massive, intricate systems work.\u201d\u2014-\u201cThe Duchess of Sussex chose to make her wedding day a moment where the world tuned in and were made to think about racial equality and gender equality. She made a decision to send the world a message.\u201d\u2014-\u201cI didn\u2019t know journalists Gerald Fischman, Rob Hiaasen, John McNamara and Wendi Winters. But I feel safe in saying they carried roughly similar expectations with them Thursday into the newsroom of the Capital Gazette in Annapolis, Maryland. What they couldn\u2019t have expected was that they wouldn\u2019t leave the building alive.This is, finally, what\u2019s so infuriating and chilling about what happened in Annapolis on Thursday: that simply carrying out one\u2019s obligation to tell the truth can get one murdered.\u201d\u2014-\u201cLike his viewers, I fell in love with Tony. He was a brilliant writer and storyteller, and you saw his toughness and sensed his vulnerability.\u201d\u2014-\u201cThere\u2019s a reason Kate Spade\u2019s work appealed just as much to a generation of 12-year-old girls as it did to their moms. At its core, it made the case that femininity, creativity and a sense of playfulness weren\u2019t qualities you needed to give up or hide away in order to be taken seriously in the world \u2013 that, in fact, they should be celebrated. It was an idealistic notion, but the woman at the helm, who built what would become a multibillion-dollar brand on boxy handbags and polka-dot prints, was all the proof we needed.\u201d\u2014-\u201cIn 2016, I was diagnosed with the life-threatening disease ALS (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis). The news shook me and my family to our core. You never think something like this can happen to you, but I remain hopeful because I am fighting for a cause that is bigger than me. And thanks to the Affordable Care Act, and the Medicaid expansion that came with it, I haven\u2019t gone bankrupt as I fight to stay alive.But Republicans continue to chip away at these hard-won, life-saving gains.\u201d\u2014-\u201cIt\u2019s sad but true: The best answer given to a fantasy wealth questionnaire in popular culture isn\u2019t the hedonism of \u2018Heathers,\u2019 but the vow of Ross Geller in \u2018Friends\u2019 as he snatches a lottery ticket from his friends in season 9: \u2018I\u2019m going to put it all into a very low-yield bond!\u2019\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s pause for a moment and consider that President Donald Trump\u2019s chief of staff Mick Mulvaney had to say on national TV that his boss is \u2018not a white supremacist\u2019 and one of Trump\u2019s senior advisers, Kellyanne Conway, had to push back against her own husband\u2019s questioning of Trump\u2019s mental state.Over the weekend, as Trump ranted on Twitter, George Conway, who is a prominent conservative lawyer, posted the psychiatric definition of narcissistic personality disorder and asked all Americans to think about Trump\u2019s \u2018mental condition and psychological state.\u2019 \u201c\u2014-\u201cThe nation is in an uproar about the latest college admissions scandal. Some wealthy parents flagrantly broke the rules and the law, and spent a ton of money, to make sure their children got into elite schools. The scandal even blew up more than usual because it ensnared the actors Lori Loughlin and Felicity Huffman. No one could believe our beloved Aunt Becky from \u201cFull House\u201d would do such a thing.Do you know who isn\u2019t surprised by the situation? Every educator in America. This thing occurs all the time, in every school. Maybe not at the same scale, with the same amounts of cash, but bad parental behavior and entitlement are old news.\u201d\u2014-\u201cThe partisan warfare over the Mueller report will rage, but one thing cannot be denied: Former President Barack Obama looks just plain bad. On his watch, the Russians meddled in our democracy while his administration did nothing about it. The Mueller report flatly states that Russia began interfering in American democracy in 2014. Over the next couple of years, the effort blossomed into a robust attempt to interfere in our 2016 presidential election.\u201d\u2014-\u201cI have to believe Joe Biden running for president is about more than ego or lifelong ambition. There has got to be something more \u2013 a cause greater than self \u2013 driving a 76-year-old man, who will already go down in the annals of American history, who is liked and respected the world over, to throw himself into the gauntlet that is a presidential race.Some will say his time has passed. He is too old. Well folks, let me state the obvious. Everything in life is relative. Donald Trump ain\u2019t exactly the picture of youth and vigor. Neither is Bernie Sanders. Joe Biden has run in presidential campaigns, depending on how you\u2019re counting, three or four times. He knows the physical toll it takes and he appears ready for it.\u201d\u2014-\u201cIn a largely botched final season, \u2018Game of Thrones showrunners David Benioff and D.B. Weiss may have salvaged their legacy by doing one thing right \u2013 pushing one message that an American audience desperately needs to hear. That message? Don\u2019t ever trust politicians who promise \u2018humanitarian intervention.\u201d\u2014-\u201cChina is being made a scapegoat for rising inequality in the United States. While US trade relations with China have been mutually beneficial over the years, some US workers have been left behind, notably Midwestern factory workers facing competition due to rising productivity and comparatively low (though rising) labor costs in China. Instead of blaming China for this normal phenomenon of market competition, we should be taxing the soaring corporate profits of our own multinational corporations and using the revenues to help working-class households, rebuild crumbling infrastructure, promote new job skills and invest in cutting-edge science and technology.\u201d\u2014-\u201cThe prevailing image of the thin runner, gym bunny, athlete, only reinforces all the stereotypes which say that thin is healthy, fat is not, and exacerbates the likelihood that fat people are dissuaded from participating in health-enhancing activities.\u201d\u2014-\u201cNot all Christians support Donald Trump. The president remains wildly unpopular among Christians who are persons of color. A majority of white Christians continue to approve of him. Of white Christians, according to Pew, evangelical support for Trump hovers around 70%; white mainline Christians are split with 48% approval; and around 44% of white Roman Catholics support him\u2026White Christianity right now is a dumpster of discord; internecine warfare has not been this bad since the 1920s when controversy ripped American churches apart on whether human beings evolved from monkeys. In the last three years, Donald Trump has replaced Charles Darwin as troublemaker-in-chief in many white American churches.\u201d\u2014-\u201cWe have weaponized our planet. All over the world life forms are experiencing weather that attack rather than sustains. Unseasonal heat that kills, rain that instead of sweetening, inundates and destroys, hurricanes that devastate. This is climate change. We are in it. It is all around us and set to get worse.\u201d\u2014-\u201cAs a federal organized crime prosecutor, I learned that the mafia uses a practice known as \u2018kicking up\u2019 or \u2018paying tribute\u2019 to the boss. Essentially, all members of a mafia family must make sure that some of their earnings end up in the boss\u2019 pocket. From the member\u2019s point of view, \u2018kicking up\u2019 is a way to show respect, curry favor, and reinforce the hierarchical power structure. From the boss\u2019s point of view, it\u2019s a way to get rich. The \u2018kicking up\u2019 model works well for the mafia, and now a political version of it seems to be catching on within the Trump administration.\u201d\u2014-\u201cAt any other time in history, one single sentence from Thursday morning, one call for China to investigate a President\u2019s political opponent, would become the biggest story of the month, a threat to a presidency.This time, the biggest story of a head-spinning month is impossible to declare. But his presidency, yes, is under threat by the President\u2019s own words and actions. Americans are outraged, and he has no inoculation against impeachment.\u201d\u2014-\u201cElijah Cummings was one of the most powerful men in America. He handled the gavel, that power, with dignity, discipline and grace. His adversaries were never his enemies. And all who worked with him, whatever their political persuasion, found him to be tough, smart, honest, honorable and fair. Even as he was assailed by the most powerful man in the world, he never ceded his personal dignity, nor that of the constituents that he represented, by responding in kind. In so doing, he lifted his community and elevated our nation.\u201d\u2014-\u201cMany parents no longer want their children marrying people from a different political party \u2014 35% of Republicans and 45% of Democrats, to be precise. Workers, like Richard, feel politics simply has no place in the office. And Americans at large dread the idea of Thanksgiving dinners with family members who might bring up President Donald Trump. Some on the right are even concerned we are on the verge of a new Civil War.\u201d\u2014-\u201cIt\u2019s the question that all members of Congress should ask themselves as they cast their vote. And it\u2019s the question citizens should keep in mind to cut through the furious spin cycle: Do you think American presidents should ask foreign powers to investigate domestic political rivals?\u201d"

        "text": "Editor\u2019s Note:, () a former CNN producer and correspondent, is a world affairs columnist. She is a frequent opinion contributor to CNN, a contributing columnist to The Washington Post and a columnist for World Politics Review. The views expressed in this commentary are her own. Viewon CNN.We\u201cbig lies\u201d before \u2013 from the 1920s and 1930s in Europe, to the United States today.Then this year Russian President Vladimir Putin launched his own brazen version of the infamous propaganda technique as he staged, and then carried out an unprovoked invasion of Ukraine. Whatever happens, Putin\u2019s propaganda gambit failed miserably. In this post-truth era of politics, Putin has lost the global disinformation war. The loss is irreversible and will prove costly.The Biden administration\u2019s unprecedented, aggressive release of detailed informationevery step Russia would take just before Moscow moved into Ukraine ultimately did not prevent Putin from starting the war. Neither did the marathon diplomatic efforts, nor the threat of forceful sanctions.In the end, Putin did exactly what President Biden told the world he would do: He invaded Ukraine on a runway of lies.In Russia, where most people get their news from government-controlled media, manyPutin\u2019s claims of a nefariousfrom Ukraine. But the rest of the world saw the propaganda fall flat in real time.\u201c\u201d doesn\u2019t begin to describe the falsehoods. Putin announced he was\u201cpeacekeepers,\u201d as he ordered his military machine to move into Ukrainian territory. His soldiers went into Ukraine to\u201cde-Nazify\u201d \u2013 smearing the Nazi label on a country that is a democracy, though aone, whose president happens to be Jewish. Putin claimed Moscow needed to move in toUkraine\u2019s Russian speakers from a nonexistent \u201cgenocide\u201d by Ukrainians (a tactic madeof World War II).Washington succeeded in thoroughly delegitimizing not only the phony Russian justification for war, but Putin\u2019s own credibility before the entire world. It may take some time for the Russian people, too, to grasp the depth of the deception, but eventually they will.The Kremlin repeatedly mocked Biden\u2019s warnings. \u201cHysteria\u201d theyAmerica\u2019s cautioning, while continuouslyplans to invade Ukraine. And theythe threat, the false flag attacks Washington warned about, claiming Russian speakers were in grave danger, as was Russia, they said, from much smaller Ukraine.Unless it wasn\u2019t blindingly obvious already, from now on every word out of Putin\u2019s mouth, every statement from the Kremlin, must be taken as potentially false.How the world can make Putin pay for invading UkrainePutin\u2019s lack of credibility, the attack\u2019s lack of legitimacy and Biden\u2019s successful deployment of the truth, have fortified NATO, united the world against Russia\u2019s aggression and made Russia\u2019s neighbors even more suspicious of Moscow. These European nations are more eager to draw close to the West, precisely the opposite of what Putin wanted. And, as heUkraine is not a real nation, Putin re-energized the Ukrainian people\u2019s sense of nationhood and national unity.Among the many statements he has repeatedly made deserving skeptical scrutiny is his objective is preventing Ukraine from joining NATO. Western analysts have engaged in self-flagellating introspection,the West for allowing NATO to spread eastward, thus provoking Putin\u2019s anger.Sure, Putin doesn\u2019t want Ukraine in NATO. And he hates that the former Soviet satellites such as Poland, Hungary and Romania are now part of the Western alliance, let alone former Soviet Republics Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania.But anyone who thinks Putin would have been satisfied and pacified by a pledge that Ukraine would never enter NATO has not been paying attention. If they had capitulated to the demand, Putin might have held back for a time, but his designs do not end with Ukraine and are not all about NATO.After all, the last time RussiaUkraine, in 2014, the issue was closer relations with the European Union, not with a military alliance. This is not about the NATO military threat. It\u2019s about Putin\u2019s megalomaniacal dreams of extending the Russian Empire and making his mark in history along with the great Russian czars. It\u2019s about keeping democracy, freedom and independence away from Russia\u2019s borders, where they could entice a population chafing under his increasingly oppressive regime.When war becomes a spectator eventPutin has already carved strongholds in other former Soviet Republics. Without Putin\u2019s support, the Belarusian dictator Alexander Lukashenko would have likely lost power to pro-democracy forces. In Kazakhstan, Putin\u2019s soldiers recently moved in to save strongman president Kassym-Jomart Tokayev. And inand, he has also carved out pro-Russian enclaves.Former Soviet republics, especially the Baltic states Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia, have every reason to worry about Putin\u2019s aspirations. His recent speech decried their creation as independent states when the USSRitself.The threat from a nuclear-armed dictator defying the international community and sending a massive military machine to crush its neighbor in the 21st century cannot be overestimated.Biden has done a stellar job of uniting America\u2019s bruised alliances despite some tactical differences. Putin may not have expected such a united front by NATO and the world\u2019s democracies.  Biden has rallied the international community to issue a forceful condemnation of Russia\u2019s violations of the most fundamental principle of international law by attacking another without provocation or a genuine justification.Going forward, the US should further tighten economic sanctions \u2013 including afrom SWIFT \u2013 enlisting as much of the world as possible and squeezing Putin and his oligarchs. In addition, NATO should be prepared in case of an even greater escalation by Russia.At this moment in US history, fresh from the memories of Afghanistan, Americans would not support going to war to defend Ukraine. But they do want to help Ukraine as their democracy and their freedom is stolen from them.  It means bolstering their ability to resist with arms, along with diplomatic and political backingPutin\u2019s ominous threats. The international community, led by the US, cannot be intimidated by a Russian tyrant who throws his critics in prison and invades his neighbors.\u201cAmerica stands up to bullies,\u201d Biden. \u201cWe stand up for freedom. This is who we are.\u201d  But he should also issue an explicit warning to Putin, if Russian forces move into NATO territory \u2013 into the Baltic States, Poland or elsewhere \u2013 the US will view it as a declaration of war, as mandated by Article 5 of the NATO charter. Further, Putin should be warned about how he conducts the war in Ukraine. If the world starts seeing large scale atrocities, NATO should caution it reserves the option to intervene.In this new age of \u201cBig Lies,\u201d the warning would have an impact because, as the whole world has seen, Biden, unlike Putin, has been telling the truth."

        "text": "Editor\u2019s Note:Jens-Christian Wagner is professor of history at the University of Jena and Director of theat Weimar, Germany. The views expressed here are his own. Read moreat CNN.The work week at the Buchenwald Memorial \u2013 which honors the lives lost at the Buchenwald Nazi concentration camp \u2013 began Monday with a shock: In the morning, we received the news from Ukraine that our friend Boris Romantschenko, a survivor of Buchenwald and three other concentration camps,when a Russian missile struck his multi-story apartment building in Kharkiv.Romantschenko was 96 years old. In the concentration camp he had fought with his fellow Russian prisoners against the SS. Since his, Romantschenko had been committed to pand to peace. Now, this brave man, whose mother tongue was Russian, has become a victim of the Russian invasion of Ukraine \u2013 a tragedy and a shame.Romantschenko was born in 1926, in the village of Bondari in theof Ukraine. In late 1942, a year-and-a-half after the German invasion of the Soviet Union, the occupiers deported all the men in his village, some as young as 16, to Germany to perform forced labor.Romantschenko, who was only 16 at the time, was sent with other villagers to Dortmund, where he was forced to work in an underground coal mine. He tried to escape from the camp, but was arrested by guards and police at the Dortmund freight station. He passed through several prisons before the Gestapo \u2014 the German secret police \u2014 deported him to the Buchenwald concentration camp near Weimar in. He was forced to do hard labor in the quarry there.In June 1943, the SS transferred him and nearlyto Peenem\u00fcnde on the Baltic Sea island of Usedom. The prisoners had to assemble the V2 rockets developed by Wernher von Braun, which were used to bombard. After aon Peenem\u00fcnde in August 1943, which also killed concentration camp prisoners, the rocket assembly was transferred to an underground tunnel facility in the Harz Mountains: theconcentration camp.The SS moved the prisoners, including Romantschenko, from Peenem\u00fcnde, to the Harz Mountains, where they worked and lived underground. Four-tier wooden cots in a 50-meter-deep tunnel served as accommodations. The prisoners called the underground concentration camp the \u201c.\u201dRomantschenko survived this hell, which had been marked by hunger, illness and abuse. He also survivedto the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp in April 1945. British troopsthere on April 15, 1945, but he was not allowed to return home just yet.In the Stalinist-ruled Soviet Union, Soviet concentration camp prisoners and prisoners of war who had survived this ordeal were suspected of having; their survival in the hands of the enemy was deemed suspicious. Like so many other Soviet concentration camp survivors, Romantschenko was forced to serve as anin the Red Army in East Germany. He was expected to prove himself there and demonstrate that he was an upright Soviet citizen. He was not allowed to return to his home in eastern Ukraine until 1950.Back in Ukraine, Romantschenko had a day-job as a typist; in the evenings he studied mining engineering and successfully earned a degree. He later designed farming machinery. Following the collapse of the Soviet Union, he began to speak openly about his experiences as a prisoner in the German concentration camps. He traveled to Germany many times and participated in commemorative events at the.Russian strike kills 96-year-old Holocaust survivor in UkraineRomantschenko spoke to schoolchildren about his experiences and urged us to safeguard peace and freedom and to protect human rights. \u201cI wish you the best of luck from the bottom of my heart, and I hope that no one ever has to go through what we former prisoners experienced,\u201d he said in 2013, speaking from the roll call square of the memorial on the anniversary of the liberation of the Buchenwald concentration camp.At the time, no one could have imagined that \u2014 nine years later \u2014Romantschenko, who had survived the concentration camps and Second World War, would be killed in a Russian air strike. He is survived by his son and granddaughter, who lovingly cared for him over the last months when fear of the Coronavirus had forced him to stay in his apartment.Hitler could not defeat our friend Boris. Now another fascist dictator, Vladimir Putin, has killed him. But Putin is not a new Hitler. Despite all the outrage over the ruler in Moscow, who ordered theand is not squeamish about brutally oppressing his own people, we should be careful not to draw false historical analogies between Nazi terror and the crimes committed by Putin and his vassal states.The Holocaust and other Nazi crimes were singular events committed in a specific historical context, and we should be wary of relativizing these events. Yet, we do not need comparisons with the Holocaust to express our outrage at the current crimes of Russia\u2019s leadership. It also should be clearly stated that Putin\u2019s claim of wanting to \u201c\u201d Ukraine is a brazen lie created to justify his aggressive imperialism, a lie rooted in the 19th-century idea of a Greater Russia.The absurdity of this lie is demonstrated by the thousands of Ukrainian survivors of Nazi terror who fought with their Russian comrades against the Nazis in the Second World War and who are now being threatened and, in the case of Boris Romantschenko, murdered by Russian bombs.It is a tragedy and betrayal of the legacy of the survivors of Buchenwald who, in 1945, stood on the roll call square of the liberated camp and swore they would build a world of peace and freedom."

View moreat CNN.Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s brutal and wholly unjustified invasion of Ukraine has transfixed the world in horror.It is an unprecedented conflict in modern times, asin The New York Times. Citing TikTok and other social media platforms, along with satellites and live traffic data on Google Maps, Friedman writes, \u201cWelcome to World War Wired \u2013 the first war in a totally interconnected world.\u201dIt\u2019s a large-scale invasion that\u2019s being \u201clivestreamed, minute by minute, battle by battle, death by death, to the world,\u201d as Daniel Johnson, an Iraq War veteran and journaliste. Those of us who are lucky enough to be miles away from the missile strikes, gunfire and shelling are watching the events unfold in real time on smart phones and other screens.And the heroic figure at the center of this war is none other than Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, a former actor and comedian who rose to prominencewho accidentally becomes the Ukrainian president. Zelensky then parlayed his success into politics,on the back of a political party named after his show, \u201cServant of the People.\u201dImagine a country where a television star could become president and emerge as a beacon of courage!Putin's war was launched on a runway of liesUkraine has interested me as a country since my first visit there as a college student in 1969, when it was an unhappy member-state of the Soviet Union. I recall making the mistake of calling Ukraine a \u201cRussian satellite\u201d and being quickly slapped down by a patriotic gentleman, who told me in no uncertain terms that Ukraine had its own beloved language, literature, history, music and cultural traditions.In August 1991, Ukraine, but the transition to a full democracy has not been easy, as corruption has hobbled the government for decades. At the time of Zelensky\u2019s election, I felt rather skeptical. The character he played in the TV show was a reformer, and the show skewered the political classes in Ukraine as well as neighboring Russia, Belarus and Georgia. His fellow Ukrainians elected him to do in real life what he did on television \u2013 sweep away corruption with a big broom.But Zelensky\u2019sand his popularity went into decline after a couple of years. By October 2021, polls showed his approval ratings hadBut sometimes history comes to the rescue of a politician, and the past week has transmogrified Zelensky from a rapidly dwindling presidential figure into a national hero on a massive scale. He has shown himself to be a man who has dug into himself and found an inspiring store of courage. When the United States offered to evacuate him from Ukraine,\u201cThe fight is here; I need ammunition, not a ride.\u201dUkraine raises moral question of war as a spectator eventHe has posted several videos online, and they\u2019ve inspired a fierce defiance among the Ukrainian people. Intitled \u201cWe are here. We are in Kyiv. We are protecting Ukraine,\u201d Zelensky can be seen surrounded by his top advisers. \u201cWe are all here. Our army are here. Citizens and society are here,\u201d he says. \u201cWe are defending our independence, our state, and it will remain so.\u201dZelensky, a fluent Russian speaker, has also appealed to Russians in another video,\u201cjust stop those who lie, lie to you, lie to us, lie to everyone, to the whole world.

We can live in peace, in a global peace.\u201dHis gifts for communication and his remarkable grasp of social media make him a formidable opponent for Putin, even though the army he commands, in sheer numbers and resources,.One can\u2019t, at this point, even begin to imagine the eventual outcome of this war. But we certainly know that Zelensky has proved himself a hero of his time and a worthy spokesman for liberal democracy and Ukrainian freedom.He has boldly challenged the logic of Putin\u2019s unrestrained aggression, laying the groundwork for a future where the Ukrainian people once again possess the right to self-determination.Hats off to you, Mr. Zelensky.

        "text": "Editor\u2019s Note:, is a past president of International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War, which won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1985., M.D., M.P.H., is an adjunct professor of public health at Tufts University School of Medicine and author of the new book \u201c\u201d about the health impacts of war. He is a past president of the American Public Health Association., M.D., is an instructor in medicine at Harvard Medical School and former chair of Greater Boston Physicians for Social Responsibility. The views expressed in this commentary are their own. Readarticles on CNN.The world is shocked by the violence in Ukrainian cities besieged by Russian forces, as they suffer under indiscriminate mortar, bomb and missile attacks. But these horrors could lead to something far worse \u2013 escalation to nuclear war. If we are going to avoid this ultimate catastrophe, we need to work urgently for the elimination of all nuclear weapons.Since the end of the Cold War more than 30 years ago, most people have paid little mind to the continued existence of nuclear weapons. But there are still more than 13,000 nuclear warheads in world arsenals, 90% of them held by either the United States or Russia,to the Arms Control Association. Experts werethese thousands of nuclear weapons as an ongoing existential threat to humanity even before Russian President Vladimir\u2019s Putin\u2019s recent warnings that he may use Russia\u2019s nuclear weapons.Russian military doctrine, like US military doctrine, allows for theto gain battlefield advantage or stave off major military defeat.A new generation is being introduced to the nuclear threatIf the Kremlin feels itself losing a conventional war, will it resort to the nuclear option as Putin has explicitly threatened? Tactical or \u201cbattlefield,\u201d nuclear weapons are far smaller than the enormous warheads intended to destroy cities \u2013 but the smallest of them still hasor 0.3 kilotons of TNT.Such a bomb creates a fireball 300 feet across. The flames and explosion could destroy residential buildings and cause life-threatening burns to anyone within about 1,000 feet and deliver a lethal dose of radiation to anyone within about 2,000 feet.Yet as bad as that sounds, in some ways, the worst thing about such a small bomb is its very smallness. It provides a terrible temptation to a military under pressure to go nuclear \u201cjust a little.\u201dWe cannot be certain what would happen next if Putin decided to take this smaller nuclear option. But war games in which a tactical nuclear weapon is used have usually progressed to full-scale nuclear war. Once that threshold is crossed, neither side tends to know how to stop.A nuclear war between Russia and NATO allies would be an unimaginable tragedy. A single 100-kiloton (100,000-ton) bomb detonated over Washington, for example, would likely kill 170,000 people and injure hundreds of thousands. A similar bombover Moscow would likely kill 250,000 and injure more than a million. In both cities, the medical care system would be destroyed outright and what few emergency medical resources remained would be totally overwhelmed.See Biden's response about Russia's potential use of chemical weaponsBut in a large-scale war, it would not be a single bomb over a single city. Rather it would be many bombs over many cities. Ashowed that if just 300 of the roughly 1,500 weapons deployed in the Russian strategic arsenal exploded over US cities,would die in the first day.But they might be the lucky ones: The vast majority of those who survived the initial attack would also die over the coming months from radiation sickness, infectious diseases, famine and exposure.In the wake of such a massive nuclear attack, the entire economic infrastructure would be destroyed: the electric grid, the Internet, food and water supply systems, the health care system \u2013 it would all be gone.Temperatures would be terribly cold, as a large-scale nuclear war would have also putinto the upper atmosphere, triggering a \u201cnuclear winter,\u201d global famine and likely the end of civilization as we understand it.It is overwhelming to consider a disaster of this magnitude, but we must. If we are lucky enough to survive this dangerous moment, we must ensure that we never find ourselves in such peril again.The only way to guarantee that nuclear weapons are never used is to eliminate all of them. Americans must negotiate now with all other nuclear-armed countries for a verifiable agreement to dismantle them \u2013 as President Joe Biden himselfin 2017. \u201cIf we want a world without nuclear weapons, the United States must take the initiative to lead us there,\u201d then-Vice President Biden stated, adding, \u201cAs the only nation to have used nuclear weapons, we bear a great moral responsibility to lead the charge.\u201dPerhaps the current moment \u2013 a planet-wide near-death experience \u2013 will finally motivate us to rise to that challenge."

        "text": "Editor\u2019s Note:Dr.is an activist, public health advocate and the co-founder of thecampaign. He featured in the award-winning documentary \u201cFor Sama,\u201d, filmed and directed by his wife, Waad al-Kateab. The views expressed in this commentary are their own. Read moreon CNN.I will never forget the first time I saw Russian warcraft in the skies above Aleppo. It was September 2015, I was in my garden with my wife Waad and a friend when we saw three Russian aircraft flying over together, launching a missile attack. I knew at that moment that everything was about to change.As a Syrian doctor and former hospital director in Aleppo, I know exactly what it means to be a direct target for the Russian forces.Thethat are being committed in Ukraine right now are, unfortunately, nothing new. They are no coincidence. Attacks on healthcare facilities are a strategic play by Russian and Russian-backed Syrian regimes and they have been attempted, developed and repeated for at least the past 11 years.When thebegan in March 2011, I was living in the western part of Aleppo. But when the eastern part of the city was declared a non-governmental area the following year, I moved there and founded a new hospital.Managing a hospital while knowing that you are the main target is a huge dilemma. The more accessible the hospital is, the easier it is to be attacked. In Aleppo, everyone knows that the hospitals are the most dangerous places to be in, or nearby.We had a saying that living near the frontlines is much safer than being at the hospital. We had patients refusing to be admitted for treatment saying, \u201cYou know doctor, it is too dangerous to be here for five days, can I take the medications at home?\u201dBy attacking hospitals and medical centers, it makes it impossible for people to live in a city. How can people stay when the places they rely on for their health and safety have become a direct target? These attacks force people out. And most importantly, it is an attempt to break their resilience. It is an attempt to break their hope.However, despite all of these horrors, we never wanted to leave. We wanted to stay in our country and keep fighting for our freedom and democracy.It came to an end when the Syrian regime and its supporters (including Russia) managed to. They destroyed eight out of nine hospitals in the city. We became trapped in a space of less than two square kilometers.An agreement took place between Russia and Turkey to evacuate whoever wanted to leave the city. Knowing that if we stayed, we would be arrested, it wasn\u2019t an evacuation for the 35,000 people who left the city \u2014 it was a forced displacement.Through all the days I have lived in Aleppo, I never dreamed of becoming a refugee \u2013 it wasn\u2019t part of my plan at all.However, today, as I write this from London where I live with my family under refugee status, five years on from being in Aleppo, I still question many decisions I took during the four years I managed the hospital. Was I to blame for changing that nurse\u2019s shift when he was then killed at the hospital? Was I to blame for not being there 24/7, watching out for the patients and the staff? Was I blamed in the first place for starting a hospital in a warzone where I know the staff and the patients would be a target?I still remember the echoes of the patients screaming out in pain in the hospital corridors. I can still hear the seven-year-old boy crying for us not to amputate his crushed leg, while I told the nurses to prepare him for an operation. I still remember the shouts and moans of mothers leaned over their little children\u2019s dead bodies.But I also remember the words of gratitude from a child while they were being discharged from the hospital. I remember the pregnant woman who was injured, and we saved both her life and the life of her baby. And I remember the way the civilians in eastern Aleppo looked at us as the only hope for them when their houses were being attacked and they were under siege.All of that makes me want to go back to Aleppo to fulfill my purpose. All of that would make me want to stay in Aleppo under the same circumstances for another 11 years. And the only way for me to cope is to keep trying to hold the perpetrators accountable.\u201cStop Bombing Hospitals.\u201d This was the message \u2013 written on signs in English, Russian and Arabic \u2013 that we delivered in a demonstration outside the Russian Embassy in London last week. It was a message not only to the Russians, but also to the public passing by, commuting to and from work. We have been trying to deliver this message for a long time \u2013 for years, in fact \u2013 in the hope that the world will act.There was another time, when I still inside Aleppo, trying to deliver this message to the world. I think of the health workers in Ukraine now, suffering from what we have been always trying to advocate against.A few days after that demonstration outside the Russian embassy, we took to the streets of London again for the 11-year anniversary of the Syrian uprising, on March 19. \u201cPutin is a war criminal. Putin is a killer,\u201d we shouted over and over. There we were chanting the same chants we have roared inside and outside our country for years. Shouting for a free Syria, demanding that politicians listen, take notice and take action.As we reached the gates of Downing Street, we were joined in chorus by people from a Ukraine march. Our voices grew louder. At first, I felt sad and heartbroken. As Syrians, we have been through this for 11 years, with half of our population now displaced.Seeing the Ukrainians chanting to free Ukraine and condemning the war crimes of Putin, I felt sad because there seemed a hope that this would end soon and that the Russians would stop.But we know how long this war could continue for. I shouted out loud, \u201cFree Syria! Free Ukraine!\u201d; \u201cFrom Syria to Ukraine, all together we will win\u201d; \u201cFrom Syria to Ukraine, occupiers have no place.\u201d With voices of the Syrian diaspora and refugees mixed with Ukrainian ones, I began to feel like we are not alone in this. It was a beautiful moment of solidarity among humans united in their fight against a shared enemy, and united in shared hope for the future of Ukrainians, Syrians and all those under the threat of Putin\u2019s forces.Now is not a time for us to say, \u201cWe told you so.\u201d Now is the time to support the people of Ukraine. It is devastating that this had to happen, for the world to take notice of what this criminal regime is capable of, and I sincerely hope that this will be the last time. I hope the world will say once and for all, \u201cNever again.\u201dAnd to my fellow doctors, nurses and medical professionals in Ukraine, I say, expect no red lines in this war. There will be no ethics, no manners, from your Russian enemy. This is a new era of providing healthcare during the conflict, where the normal health policies become useless.Find suitable new guidelines to discharge patients as soon as possible. Limit the gathering of many patients at the same location \u2013 try to distribute the services you provide to many locations instead of one. The most important thing is to remember you are not only providing healthcare \u2013 you are the heart of your city\u2019s resilience.Your attackers will try to break you, they will try to make you suffer. But remember that being alive is your act of resilience. Each person matters. One healthcare provider can make all the difference. Do not let them break your will. Do not let them break your resilience."

        "link": "https://edition.cnn.com/2021/01/22/opinions/trump-bullying-and-fear-bardsley/index.html",
        "text": "Editor\u2019s Note:Greg Bardsley is the author of the novels \u201cCash Out\u201d (2012) and \u201cThe Bob Watson\u201d (2016) from HarperCollins Publishers. A former columnist and speechwriter, he lives in the San Francisco Bay area. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. View moreon CNN.As a child, my dad was so small that people called him Minnow.His size often invited teasing, ridicule and bullying. One day in grade school, it culminated with an older (and much larger) bully challenging my dad to a fight in front of everyone after school.As my dad would tell me, his stomach was tied in knots for the rest of the day. He didn\u2019t want to fight, and he knew that if he did fight, he almost certainly would get beat up. Hounded by giddy classmates all day \u2014 \u201cMinnow, what are you gonna do?\u201d \u2014 my dad told them that he would show up for the fight. He knew that if he cowed, the bully would be emboldened and things for everyone would only get worse.Frothy excitement engulfed the school as news spread that Minnow would fight the bully. Finally, the school bell rang, and my dad walked to the specified location, followed by a throng of curious classmates. Fear gripped him.If there's anyone who can reach a deal, it's Joe BidenWhen my dad finally arrived, the bully wasn\u2019t there.My dad waited. And waited.The bully never showed.My dad said he learned an important lesson that day. For bullies, fear and intimidation is their oxygen. Fear and intimidation give them power. And while some bullies will fight, a great many more are relying on you to cower \u2014 it is the secret of their power.As things turned out, \u201cMellow Minnow,\u201d as he was known, would later become a Golden Gloves boxer and would finish his career as one of the top flyweights in the United States. He said that during the Korean War, a few larger GIs made the mistake of trying to push him around.Most people who knew my dad would never have guessed this part of his history \u2013\u2014 that the affable, kind, quiet and self-deprecating Iowa native with bifocals and a comb-over was once a fighter, and that he would stand up for himself, for others and for what was right, if needed.I went to Washington for joy, and Amanda Gorman delivered itEver since the Trump mob followed the call of their leader and descended on the Capitol on January 6, I have thought a lot about the parallels of my dad\u2019s story and the fears many of us have felt.Some members of Congress reportedly voted against electoral certification on January 6 because they were afraid for their physical safety. MAGA bullies threatened to descend on state capitals with more violence. They threatened to attack Washington, DC. They showed us their guns and hatred. Fear ensued, and some argued that this week\u2019s presidential inauguration should be moved indoors. Others suggested that we should \u201cgo easy\u201d on the insurrectionists so as not to trigger more terror and violence.Instead, people decided to stand up to the bullies.In recent weeks, hundreds of domestic terrorists have been arrested. People across the political spectrum have stepped up and identified radicalized friends or family members who participated in the insurrection. Ten Republicans joined Democrats in impeaching our top bully, despite numerous death threats from the mob he egged on.If Biden wants to fix health care, he will need RepublicansLocal and state Republicans have been recognized for refusing to be bullied into overturning election results in their communities. Even the losing vice president refused to leave the Capitol during the January 6 insurrection, determined to execute his duty and protect our democracy even as the MAGA mob hunted for him in the Capitol, chanting, \u201cHang Mike Pence.\u201dMore than 25,000 soldiers arrived in Washington DC, to face any bullies who might show up with their guns, swastikas, Confederate flags and bully clubs. And this week President Biden took the oath of office outdoors, right where the attempted coup had unfolded only fourteen days earlier. People faced their fears, and they ensured the orderly and democratic transfer of power.People stood up to the bullies, who never showed up. That includes our top bully, who chose to flee town.This week we are reminded that fear and intimidation are diminished when people come together and stand up to the bullies. We have learned that there are enough leaders (and citizens) who will not appease \u2014 because history tells us that appeasing fascists, thugs and bullies never works. People stood up for what was right, and the bullies lost a bit of their dark power.I wasn\u2019t planning on sharing the story of my late father. Then this weekend as I cleaned out our office closet, I found a photo of him and his American Legion boxing team \u2014 Minnow, the little guy who faced his fears and stood up to the bully, and in doing so found new power and light."

        "text": "Editor\u2019s Note:This piece is the second part of a CNN Opinion series, \u201c,\u201d which explores the personal struggles Americans face at a time of profound social change. Rebecca Cokley is a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress, where she works on disability policy. Formerly, she was the executive director of the National Council on Disability and served in the Obama administration in the Administration for Community Living and the Presidential Personnel Office, where she was responsible for outreach to diversity and minority organizations. The views expressed in this commentary are solely hers.I was lying on the cold metal table in the operating room in the midst of giving birth to my second child, in what had been a totally normal and uneventful pregnancy, when the anesthesiologist assigned to my C-section suggested that my obstetrician might want to tie my tubes. He didn\u2019t ask me. He didn\u2019t even acknowledge that I was there, though I was in a ragged state of consciousness. He said, \u201cWhile you\u2019re down there, we are going to go ahead and tie her tubes, right?\u201dAt a time when I was most vulnerable, a medical professional thought it was a good suggestion, an acceptable notion, to make an assumption with this level of this importance for me. My doctor, my husband, and I all responded unanimously: \u201cNo!\u201dAs upsetting as that moment was, it was not at all surprising to be treated as less than fully human. Professionally, I work as an advocate for the disabled. But I also know from 39 years of life as a little person, situations like these are such a clear indication that we aren\u2019t seen as whole people. No matter what we do, what we achieve, the nondisabled world will largely always see us as less than, as separate.The delivery room wasn\u2019t my first experience with ignorance around disability and family. It wasn\u2019t always perfect for me growing up.  My high school guidance counselor told me point blank, \u201cKids like you don\u2019t go here, you go to the special school.\u201d If it weren\u2019t for the teachers, whom I loved, I easily could have fallen into a different path because of how that counselor treated me.I think about that, as I prepare to give birth again in a few months, to a boy who may be of average size. If he is, his mother and two siblings may always be \u201cdifferent\u201d in a way that he is not.When he comes, I\u2019ll be having another C-section. Little people can only deliver that way, as our pelvic area is not large enough to deliver vaginally, so I\u2019ve always had an anesthesiologist present for the entire procedure. General anesthesia is hard on those of us with dwarfism as well, because of how our faces are shaped and complexities in our airways, and spinal anesthesia, including epidurals, can also be hard depending on any spinal issues. For a long time the only option was putting us completely out, as was done with my mom during my delivery.With my last delivery, I was already in a bad place with this anesthesiologist  \u2013 who was in a position of medical authority (even though he wasn\u2019t ultimately in control of my treatment) and somehow thought my right to have more children was his business.   I had asked him to review the notes from my first C-section and my MRIs to make sure he felt confident he could do the job. But he failed, because the spinal block wore off halfway through the surgery and he had to help to determine alternate means of sedation \u2013 which resulted in him giving me a low level of general anesthesia to complete the procedure.I don\u2019t know for sure why he suggested I be sterilized, but I can only assume that he thought I should be medically prevented from having more kids because, like my children Jackson and Kaya, I was born with dwarfism. I\u2019ve asked multiple nondisabled friends who have had the same anesthesiologist and none reported him making any remarks indicating he felt the same way about their right to bear children.While I grew up in the Bay Area, I now live in Washington, D.C., with my husband and kids. Professionally and personally, being a little person is central to who I am, but it\u2019s also one among many ways that I see and make sense of the world. For better and for worse, being different is hugely significant in my life, individually and with my family. And I think we should be more open with all kids about how being different can be a good thing, an important thing.Part of the legacy of the landmark 1990are the only person in their families with it).My parents met in 1970 at a convention of Little People of America, an organization founded by actorin 1957 to provide support and information to people with dwarfism and their families. There are, affiliates internationally, and annual conventions that bring together around 2,000 people in different cities every year.My dad ran afor people with disabilities and my mom ran a disabled student center at a local community college, so I grew up in the Bay Area surrounded by people with all different types of disabilities.I also grew up in an environment where expectations of me were set high, by my family and by a strong network of supporters and allies. My mom went back to school for her bachelor\u2019s and master\u2019s degrees when I was around 8 or 9, as a re-entry student at the College of San Mateo and the College of Notre Dame, respectively.I was a typical presence with her on campus, sitting in the back taking notes along with the other students (I was always nerdy). I remember getting in long discussions with one of the professors, who was a nun, about Kevin Smith\u2019s latest film, \u201cDogma,\u201d and her asking me to write a paper on it while I was still in junior high school.It took a long time for me to realize that the experiences I had growing up, becoming an adult, and starting my own family were not always the norm \u2013 and that the work of achieving acceptance for those with disabilities was far from over.All my life I wanted to work in civil rights, and found myself thinking of being a civil rights lawyer from an early age. I think having parents who were so civically engaged was a key piece of this, as was growing up in the San Francisco Bay Area during the onset of the AIDS epidemic. I remember that in the early days when it was still stigmatized as the \u201cgay cancer,\u201d my parents and I attended so many funerals. And at so many of them we were the only people there, minus a friend or two.I asked my mom why we had to go (my 6 year old brain was much more focused on getting to the mall to go ice skating at the time) and I remember my mom telling me, \u201cWe\u2019re here because no one deserves to have no one stand for them. They\u2019re no different from us. We are here for the reason that someday, if something like this happens to our community, we\u2019d hope they would be here for us.\u201dAnd I think in so many ways, that comment, while in passing, became my true north.When I was 10, my dad passed away in his sleep after confronting health issues for years and using a wheelchair most of my life after a fall. Soon after, my mom took me to the Ringling Brothers circus. We were in the parking lot leaving the Cow Palace when I turned to my mom and said the seven words she had feared her entire life. \u201cMom, I think I want to be clown.\u201d She slammed on the brakes so hard I thought my head would hit the dashboard. \u201cWhat?\u201d she asked.\u201cYeah, I think I want to be a clown.\u201d We rode home in silence. I didn\u2019t realize at the time, but this was a huge crisis of faith for her. All I had ever talked about at that point was fighting injustice and here I was telling her I wanted to take on a role that focused on little people not being taken seriously.I later learned that she broke down in tears with a group of fellow graduate students, telling them she had failed as a parent. A few weeks later, I told her I only wanted to be a clown because clowns traveled the world, and that I had returned to my senses and decided to be a civil rights attorney again. It was an important lesson in the importance of having high expectations and being flexible that would serve me repeatedly throughout my career and as a mom.Because of my passion for civil rights, my parents introduced me at a young age to, an up-and-coming attorney and little person who worked in Los Angeles. Miller went on to be theto work in the White House, under President Clinton, and when he found out my love of reading, would routinely send me case briefs to read \u201cfor fun.\u201dMy mom and dad thought it was important that I knew people like me doing the work I wanted to do. I got to return the favor in 2007, when I recruited my mentor Miller for the Barack Obama campaign and ended up following in his footsteps by taking a job at the White House in 2010.Taking this path was important to me \u2013 and to my family as well.When it came time to go to college, I started out at the same school where my mom had gone. I studied in London during my sophomore year of high school.   It was an incredible experience. Not only for all the amazing things that London offered, but also because manners often trumped the notion of treating disabled people in public like a sideshow. I didn\u2019t have to worry about tourists taking photos of me, or having \u201cmidget midget\u201d shouted at me in a bar, as had happened to me in the United States.Returning home, I accepted a full scholarship to the University of Santa Cruz, where I decided to go into political science and study with professors like Wendy Mink, Peter Euben, and Angela Davis.My first two jobs after college really shaped my life. One was an internship with my local member of Congress, Rep., the only member of the House of Representatives who was a Holocaust survivor. He and his staff were hugely supportive of my passion for civil rights and it managed to keep my feet in the area of politics while I also worked at my second job \u2013 at Victoria\u2019s Secret. I started as a part-time holiday hire and was quickly promoted to credit and bra specialist lead before becoming a co-manager.You may wonder what politics and lingerie have in common. I always sum it up as, \u201cYou have to make someone want something they don\u2019t need and want to pay too much for it.\u201dMy boss at Victoria\u2019s Secret had grown up next door to a family of little people who had offered her stability in a childhood that had little, so it was nice to not have to go into a job where I\u2019d have to prove myself just as capable as a nondisabled person. I think being a person with a physical disability working at the most image conscious company in the world actually made me more approachable to a lot of customers and also made me want to help folks who may have felt nervous or uncomfortable in the store.I think the funniest thing was how customers would describe me when checking out. They\u2019d actively fumble their words and body around trying to describe me without saying I was a little person. \u201cUmmmmm, the girl in the black suit.\u201d (We all wore black suits). \u201cWell, she\u2019s petite.\u201d (There were a number of us who were.) My sales associates were comfortable with me being a little person but the customers were very concerned about being rude or just not knowing what to say in general.The experience did make me more conscious about my safety, because I had a few strange customers who would follow me around in the store or who would act like they were \u201cfascinated\u201d with me. One couple in particular went too far and made a point of repeatedly telling me, \u201cWe could pick you up and walk out with you. We\u2019d take you home and make you a button in our mattress. No one could physically stop us.\u201d I think as a little person you tend to get a heightened \u201cspidey sense\u201d because of how people treat you, and that experience definitely set mine off. But on the whole my customers were kind and thankful for my help.Doing political and public policy work was still my dream, though, and in 2004, I moved to Washington to take a job working in education policy. A mentor of mine persuaded me to come and work for the. I learned a ton working there, and it was there that I also met my amazing husband, Patrick. He says he noticed me right away \u2013 cautioning himself not to come off as creepy by \u201cstaring at the new girl.\u201d I have no memory of this.Today, our family exists at multiple crossroads.Patrick is average height and African-American.I\u2019m a little person. Our two kids are both little people. My husband has a vision impairment, so I\u2019m the driver in the family, but, usually, new average-height people we meet assume he\u2019s the driver. Like many D.C. couples, we met at work.When having our own children, it was interesting how our friends reacted to our news. Our LP (that\u2019s how those of us in the community refer to \u201clittle people\u201d) friends all automatically assumed the baby would be a little person; we see it as a marker of cultural pride. Our average height friends didn\u2019t ask me about whether the baby would be LP or average height \u2013 they\u2019d ask Patrick, and he would typically respond that he didn\u2019t care either way.I worked at the White House when I was pregnant and had our first child, Jackson. To him, it was routine to head back to the office with me after pickup so I could keep working. In Barack Obama\u2019s White House, it never felt weird or out-of-place being the mother of African-American kids with disabilities who were on a first-name basis with senior White House officials.the boss himself, \u201cI believe that this country succeeds when everyone gets a fair shot, when everyone does their fair share, when everyone plays by the same rules.\u201d And those are really the values that we stress as we\u2019re raising Jackson and his younger sister, Kaya.At age 6, Jackson\u2019s awareness of the world is growing. One day, he came home from kindergarten and said, \u201cMom, you\u2019re white, Dad\u2019s black, and I\u2019m peach.\u201d His dad turned around and said \u201cPeach? You\u2019re black.\u201d Jackson pointed to his arm, shook his head, and said \u201cPeach!\u201d This made us realize that we needed to discuss our kids and their heritage much more than we had been.We\u2019ve purposely stayed in the D.C. area because there is a thriving chapter of Little People of America here and I want my children to grow up with a strong tie to that community. It\u2019s  important for them to have friends who are other LPs, have teen and young adult LPs to look up to, and to know LP adults.Since we\u2019re raising children who also identify as African-American, it is imperative to Patrick and me that they have strong people in the black community to look up to and relate to. We are blessed with a cadre of aunties and uncles and cousins who are biological and chosen family members from my husband\u2019s childhood, his time at Howard University, and our various circles of friends. As a white woman, I have to be aware that my daughter in particular is going to have questions that I can\u2019t \u2013 and in some cases, shouldn\u2019t \u2013 be the one to answer.As a professional advocate, I\u2019ve spent the last few years working on issues tied to police killings of African-Americans with disabilities. Unarmed people of color whose names you may know because their deaths involved the police \u2013, Natasha McKinnon, Sandra Bland \u2013 were also all people with disabilities, many of whom disclosed their disabilities to law enforcement and still died.Raising two African-American children with disabilities, I understand that some of the very qualities that endear them to people now \u2013 their curiosity, their feeling that they\u2019ve never met a stranger, their trust in the world \u2013 could be the very same things that could potentially put them in danger. So we have to talk about these things, because while the bubble of our home provides safety and security, the outside world is a different place.My children have grown up knowing chosen family members who have been assaulted by law enforcement. It broke my heart to have to talk to my son about this, but we also couldn\u2019t keep it from him.When the anesthesiologist suggested that my doctor sterilize me, what I heard was someone with medical authority basically telling another person with medical authority that I shouldn\u2019t be having any more children. I was certainly angry, but not surprised. Many of us in the disability community. Whether it\u2019s forced sterilization, experimentation, eugenics, or treatments to keep us small and manageable, removing our right to control our bodies, our personhood, has been common practice by the \u201cwell-meaning\u201d nondisabled public for centuries.No amount of education, of mentors, or of amazingly supportive workplaces would have prepared me for this level of discrimination. Yet this is what many disabled people encounter as parents.Under the law in dozens of states, childrenfrom their homes based solely on a parent\u2019s disability. In my work as an advocate, I\u2019ve spoken with a dyslexic mom who lost her kids when pharmacists thought she would misread instructions and overmedicate them, and a father who lost his kids when a ball rolled into the street and he wheeled his chair to the curb, always in control, to help the kid retrieve it and a neighbor saw.If not denied personhood outright, we tend to get our personhood policed by rhetoric and language.  Nondisabled people routinely refer to us using euphemisms like \u201cspecial needs,\u201d \u201cdifferently abled,\u201d or, in a pun on language from the past, \u201chandi-capable.\u201dThese aren\u2019t words anyone like me (meaning disabled) came up with \u2013 they were defined by society because the concept of \u201cdisability\u201d makes nondisabled people feel uncomfortable. It\u2019s a reminder that yes, we are different.But as I like to remind people, disability is written into civil rights laws, so by teaching young people that \u201cdisability\u201d is something to be ashamed of \u2013 say, by implying that someone shouldn\u2019t have more children because of one \u2013 society is, in fact, disconnecting them from their civil rights.  We didn\u2019t celebrate the 27th anniversary of the \u201cAmericans with Special Needs Act\u201d this summer, after all.The disability community continues to struggle with media and interest-group narratives that frame us as victims or takers. The ongoing health care fight by the disability-rights group ADAPT \u2013 with its images of Americans in wheelchairs protesting proposed cuts to Medicaid and\u2013 and others was a powerful moment in our movement. And while the public reacted with outrage at disabled people being abused by law enforcement, I have to wonder if nondisabled people really knew just what the protesters with disabilities, including our friend Steph Woodward, whose image became synonymous with this activism for a time, were really fighting for.They were fighting for their very lives, their right to determine where they wanted to live \u2013 in this case, in their communities rather than being forcibly institutionalized in nursing homes. They are strong, but were.We talk about this a lot in our home, about the issues affecting the intersecting oppressions we encounter, whether ableism, racism or sexism. It\u2019s impossible not to \u2013 and we would be irresponsible if we didn\u2019t.We also spend a lot of time talking to my kids about consent. People often act as though disabled people don\u2019t have a right to bodily autonomy. When I attended the women\u2019s march in D.C. in January, I was repeatedly grabbed and manhandled by women who wanted to know where was my mommy and why didn\u2019t I know better than to wander away from her. They all looked shocked when I responded, \u201cI am the mommy,\u201d but not a single one apologized to me.As little people, we also deal with the public taking photos and videos of us without our consent. I want my children to understand how to navigate the world safely but at the same time feel like they can speak up when someone is treating them wrong or in a way that makes them uncomfortable.Patrick and I are now expecting our third child. As of yet, we don\u2019t know if he will be a little person or an average height child, though so far, it looks like he will be the latter. But we don\u2019t care either way.What matters to us, as we anticipate the joy and sleepless nights ahead, is that our family is growing again."

        "text": "Editor\u2019s Note:Want to keep up with the best commentary in 2022? Sign up for,.Many of us welcomed this year from inside Covid bubbles, socially distanced and masked and clinging to hope that after the trash pile of 2020 a new year would dawn better, brighter and \u2013 eventually \u2013 more \u201cnormal.\u201d But soon enough, it turned out that getting to normal wouldn\u2019t be a quick trip.In a tumultuous year, writers at CNN Opinion made sense of seismic political and social events and pointed the way toward a better future. Here are 40 of the most popular, intriguing and insightful pieces of 2021.Pause with us to rest and reflect on the moments that shaped our year, and then take a deep breath as we look ahead to what\u2019s next.President Donald Trump has brought the country to depths of division, unrest and instability that once would have been unthinkable \u2013 even if they were completely predictable. The entire world watched aghast as a mob of Trump supporters, whipped into a frenzy by the President\u2019s incitement, stormed the US Capitol, smashing windows, forcing a lockdown and bringing a temporary end to a constitutionally mandated affirmation of President-elect Joe Biden\u2019s victory in the November election. What more does it take? It\u2019s time for Vice President Mike Pence and the members of the Cabinet to pull the country back from the edge of abyss and remove Trump from office.The image is jarring because it\u2019s a scene so commonplace, so normal. A few Black men are seen in a video sweeping and vacuuming in the Capitol building to undo some of the damage caused by a mostly White mob trying to overturn an election because their preferred candidate lost\u2026.With each stroke of the broom, they were slowly helping to piece this democracy back together.This month we\u2019ve seen two very different symbols in the Capitol. On January 6, we watched insurrectionists strut through that building with the Confederate flag. \u2026 Just two weeks later, Kamala Harris got sworn in as vice president \u2013 the first woman and third person of color to do so. So, whose century is it? Does it belong to the people who are trying to recapture something they\u2019ve lost? Or is there something new happening? I believe it\u2019s the latter.Maybe you\u2019re like me: afraid, anxious, nervous, or feeling whatever else you call that paralyzing sensation that radiates from below the ribcage up into your chest. You can\u2019t stop worrying about all you have left to lose. You think you might be losing your mind. I find myself experiencing this mental-health decline even though I have not fallen gravely ill, or lost my job, or lost my home, or been trapped in a long-term care facility, or endured any of the other major tribulations that currently afflict tens of millions of my fellow Americans. And so I wonder: If the pandemic is this bad for me, how much worse is it for you?Gillette is the hub of a region called the Powder River Basin, which produces roughly 40% of US coal. West Virginia\u2019s coal country gets more attention, but Wyoming produces more coal at this point. Gillette is the town that powers America \u2013 at least it did for decades.But as the urgency of the climate crisis has become more apparent, markets have shifted toward cheaper and cleaner electricity sources \u2013 wind, solar and natural gas. Residents here know that the Biden administration, which rejoined the Paris Agreement on climate change and promises a 100% clean electric grid by 2035, could help push Gillette out of existence.When trials began to show high efficacy and effectiveness for vaccines, it offered a glimmer of hope for millions of people. In the United States, that glimmer turned into a bright promise of returning to some semblance of our full lives after the FDA approved the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines. But the rollout has proven to be less than perfect. As Brenda Kotewa of Bellingham, Washington, put it, so many Americans are left \u201cwondering if we\u2019ll get the vaccine or the virus first.\u201d May (this) selection of stories serve as a reminder that you are not alone.In an episode of \u201cUnfiltered\u201d following two mass shootings \u2013 one in Atlanta, Georgia, and another in Boulder, Colorado \u2013 political commentator SE Cupp urges Americans to stop standing in the way of solutions to solve the nation\u2019s gun violence problem.As the first Korean American first lady in the history of the United States, Maryland\u2019s first Asian American first lady, and a first-generation immigrant, my heart breaks for all victims of hate and racism. Today, our grandparents, parents, daughters, sons, sisters, brothers, and friends are forced to live in fear. But as proud citizens of this country, we should not have to be afraid of anything. The time has come for us to speak out, and demand action.Former House Speaker John Boehner, in excerpts from \u201cOn the House: A Washington Memoir,\u201d provides clear evidence that the Republican Party was already struggling with its identity and ideology long before Trump was a serious candidate for political office.President Biden\u2019s decision to announce a date for pulling all US troops out of Afghanistan by the 20th anniversary of 9/11 sets the stage for a predictable disaster.I don\u2019t begrudge others who burst into celebration at the sound of \u201cguilty\u201d guilty\u201d \u201cguilty\u201d in the case of Derek Chauvin, the former police officer who slowly murdered George Floyd in broad daylight. I feel more relieved than anything else. But I\u2019m not in a celebratory mood \u2013 because it took overwhelming evidence to convict a police officer, evidence so clear even his former boss and colleagues testified against him. There won\u2019t always be that much evidence.I\u2019m hopeful that the picture these results paint will show that autism is less of a puzzle to be solved and more of a story to be told. I want the answers and knowledge that we glean to open a discussion on how we can improve the quality of life not just for future generations, but for individuals on the spectrum living in the world right now.When President Donald Trump\u2019s social media feeds went dark after the insurrection at the Capitol, it felt like a fog beginning to lift. \u2026 From exhaustive fact checks to contentious briefing-room clashes over the administration\u2019s \u201calternative facts,\u201d debunking the whirl of lies became a full-time process and started derailing pressing long-term conversations. But as the past few weeks have shown, the mendacity that once seemed like a feature of politics in the age of Trump has outlived the former president\u2019s Twitter feed.The legacy of slavery goes deep in this country. Looking closely at an iconic history painting and a contemporary reinterpretation of it helps us recognize racism\u2019s abiding shadow and envision a more just future.What was once the wealthiest Black neighborhood in America became charred ash in a matter of hours. 10,000 Black residents were left homeless \u2013 and an entire generation of Black Tulsans were robbed of their wealth and prosperity they had built. To this day, not one person has ever been held accountable and not a single cent of reparations has been paid to the survivors or the victims\u2019 descendants. Without this necessary reckoning with the past, we\u2019re already repeating it.A pandemic that upended so many of our lives and killed more than half a million Americans was bound to make a lot of us reconsider how we were living before. Our country may treat wage workers as disposable automatons, but if the past year has taught us anything, it should be how much we need the folks who deliver our food, stock our grocery store shelves, care for our children and tend to our ill and aging.Here we are, six months into the year 2021, attempting to return to a world that abruptly shut down 16 months ago. The on-ramps are scrambled. Some of them are gone. It\u2019s a bit like waking up from a dream, except we are different, and the world is different, and will not, despite all the talk of getting \u201cback to normal,\u201d be the same again.Last month, the vice president was criticized by Republicans, along with members of her own party, for comments she made on her first foreign trip to Guatemala. But I understood that Harris was trying to balance being authentic and honest with being politically correct, all while under the pressure to please everyone on all sides of a complex immigration issue.In disability social media, where I\u2019m active, this kind of story is common. I live in Minnesota, first found it on the page of a mom who lives in Illinois. and before it got national media coverage, saw it ricocheting through my networks around the county and beyond. We all shared it \u2026 because as parents of kids with disabilities, each of us has encountered moments like this. And fury is appropriate.On Tuesday in Tokyo, Simone Biles reminded all of us that while she might own four Olympic golds and 25 world medals \u2013 making her the most decorated gymnast in history \u2013 she is, indeed, human.In the moment, it can feel good to indulge our emotions and let them have it. But the cost is high: We damage the relationship, and they don\u2019t get vaccinated. \u2026 So when we can\u2019t persuade with facts or criticism, what can we lead with instead? Two things: empathy and curiosity.Two decades of war. Thousands of lives lost. Trillions of dollars spent. And, at this point, it\u2019s hard to tell for what. The Taliban has retaken the country my dad and thousands of others died fighting to free from future oppression. If my dad were alive today, I know he would be worried about the thousands of Afghans who risked their lives and their families\u2019 security in service to an America that has now left many of them stranded, helpless, behind enemy lines.The stakes of teaching in person in a pandemic without proper safety protocols and necessary accommodations being uniformly required have led faculty to make difficult decisions. Even in places where masks and/or vaccines are required, some faculty have resigned from their positions rather than teach in unsafe environments that may expose them and their family members to infection.As we approach the 2022 midterm elections, the President faces a critical juncture. He will need to maneuver carefully to pass key legislation and retain the Democratic majorities in Congress that will allow him to plow on with his agenda while Republicans are undertaking a massive effort to curtail voting rights and recapture control of Congress in order to make the second half of his term a living hell.As though it\u2019s easy to forget that your strong, stocky father was whittled down to only pieces. That when we buried him, only my mother knew how much of him was inside the coffin. As if we\u2019d forget that this actually makes us lucky. That others have only empty plots filled with knickknacks, mementos instead of remains\u2026.As if we could forget. As if we could let go.Like many Texans, I am devastated at what my state legislature has done to women\u2019s reproductive rights, and what the Supreme Court has allowed. And my deep concern is all the greater because these actions come amid other outrages in my state: a hobbled Covid-19 response that has already caused a surge in cases among children and shutdowns in one school district after two middle-school teachers died of Covid-19 complications in the same week, a health care system operating beyond capacity, an unregulated and unreliable electricity grid, and now new voting rights restrictions signed by our governor, Greg Abbott, on Tuesday. And the list goes on. But the answer is not to cut Texas loose from the rest of the country, or to leave the state.Elizabeth Holmes, Silicon Valley\u2019s one-time darling for founding and leading the now failed biotech company Theranos, is on trial in one of the most highly anticipated criminal fraud cases in the country \u2013 and one of her potential defense strategies is not what you might expect.It feels impossible that something horrific could have happened to a young woman whose life and relationship \u2013 documented on her beautiful Instagram grid \u2013 appeared to be perfect. The fact that it likely wasn\u2019t \u2013 and that the stories of most women who go missing remain untold \u2013 both speak to a darker truth about the dangers all women face every day.While it\u2019s appalling to confront the fact that using Instagram has harmful effects on young girls and that Facebook appears to have prioritized its own growth and profits over curbing the toxic effects of its platforms, it shouldn\u2019t be shocking. What is stunning is the extent to which Facebook seems to have ignored the obvious damage it was causing to society in the process \u2013 from contributing to poor body images to depression in teens.At Trump\u2019s past post-presidency events, you wouldn\u2019t find the state\u2019s leading GOP officials attending en masse. \u2026 Saturday\u2019s rally in Iowa, though, was different. This one was attended by longtime Iowa US Sen. Chuck Grassley, Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds, Iowa Reps. Mariannette Miller-Meeks and Ashley Hinson, and other mainstream Republican officials. Some of these very same people, who just nine months ago were slamming Trump for his role in the Capitol riots, were now only too happy to be seen supporting him. This is politics at its worst \u2013 and at its most dangerous for our democracy.The notorious Nazi Adolf Eichmann, widely known as the \u201cArchitect of the Holocaust,\u201d stood charged with unimaginable crimes against humanity \u2013 the murder of millions. While the Eichmann trial is now firmly part of world history, the lessons still resonate today. Hatred based on race, religion, sex, sexual orientation and ethnicity sadly remains a potent and growing threat in the United States and elsewhere. We need to remember the Eichmann trial for what it can teach us about our collective past \u2013 and future.As popular culture so often does, it was a TV show \u2013 Michaela Coel\u2019s brilliant 2020 HBO series \u201cI May Destroy You\u201d \u2013 that brought stealthing more fully into mainstream awareness, and made its own ruling on what, exactly, it is\u2026Alas, real life doesn\u2019t often afford such neatly scripted opportunities to hold someone publicly accountable. But there are clear measures that can help ensure stealthing stops happening so often. Other states need to follow California\u2019s example and pass anti-stealthing bills, and we need to be talking about the subject a lot more, and more loudly.Education. Crime. The economy. Reforming state government. All of this mattered to Virginia voters and Glenn Youngkin did what Donald Trump failed to do in the 2020 election: construct a platform to meet those concerns. Make America Boring Again by running on issues and refusing to chase the personal grievance of the day.Perhaps the oldest and grandest question asked by humanity is \u201cHow did the universe come into existence?\u201d A recent astronomical measurement recorded in a laboratory at the South Pole is causing scientists to revisit their theories. While those people who crave certainty in their life might be unhappy because of the new measurement, it\u2019s important to remember that there are no sacred cows in science, and scientists are always checking and rechecking even their favorite universal models.Odds are there are more feather-duster days ahead. Thus is the nature of a presidency in fractious and turbulent times, with tenuous majorities in each chamber of Congress. But for these next few days, at least, Joe Biden is a peacock once more.Evan Mawarire, Marina Nemat and Wai Hnin Pwint Thon are among the 21st century\u2019s freedom fighters \u2013 people who have risked their lives and liberty in a battle for democracy that is being fought globally. In this series, \u201cVoices of Freedom,\u201d 13 dissidents from around the world are telling their stories and making the case for supporters of democracy to fight for restoring and protecting the rights to speak freely and vote in honest elections.Anyone watching the proceedings who was unfamiliar with the events that led to this trial would be forgiven for assuming that (Kyle) Rittenhouse was the victim of an unspeakable crime rather than being its accused perpetrator. His protracted sobs \u2013 and people\u2019s telling reactions to them \u2013 spoke volumes about the moment America now finds itself in. Whether or not Rittenhouse is convicted, the perspective he represents \u2013 galvanized by the anger, fear and prejudice of White Americans \u2013 has already achieved its ends: normalizing a kind of racial privilege exposed, but far from extinguished, in the wake of George Floyd\u2019s murder last year.The bill\u2019s passage \u2026 signals the beginning of an era in which Congress recognizes that women\u2019s problems are America\u2019s problems, and women\u2019s successes are America\u2019s success. Most importantly, it is an acknowledgment that our country will never realize its full potential if women and, in particular, women of color continue to be devalued, underpaid and left behind.This landscape \u2013 and others like it \u2013 tells a story about the history of our country and humankind itself. Ancient people would travel for hundreds of miles to reach this cultural center, which has left behind archeological mysteries that continue to perplex us more than a thousand years later. These places remain sacred to the Pueblo and Navajo communities, and they should be incredibly important to all of us.I\u2019m not sharing my family\u2019s painful story to take a stance on abortion. That\u2019s a journalism taboo. That\u2019s not what this is. I share our hardship to show how important it is to have options in reproductive health care."

        "text": "On Tuesday, CNN Opinion publisheda personal essay by Sarah Lenti, a political strategist who decided to have children through in vitro fertilization (IVF).  She writes: \u201cI am a single mother by choice. Yet I was raised in a Christian, conservative home, where I grew up believing in the traditional family unit. And I was taught that there was an order to achieving it. First, fall in love. Second, marry a man. Third, start a family. Now in my fifth decade, only one has proven true for me \u2013 and it isn\u2019t the first.\u201dLenti\u2019s piece was the first of a CNN Opinion series, \u201cWhat it\u2019s like to be me,\u201d which explores personal struggles Americans face in a time of social change.We asked you, CNN\u2019s audience, to share your stories of IVF and adoption through text message and WhatsApp \u2013 and you responded with personal experiences that were as various as they were emotionally compelling.You shared with us stories of your joys and your struggles. You shared family photos \u2013 and some of you even sent us videos about your families\u2019 journeys. Here they are.\u201cThe article I just read in CNN on a single mom by choice hit home. My daughter just turned 1 and I too began this journey a little less than two years ago. I will be 38 in May and I always wanted a family. I dated someone long-term and when that relationship ended, by the time I finished licking my wounds, I was 36 with no prospects. I went on every online dating site and never met anyone worth my time. I decided to give insemination a try. I conceived relatively quickly. It was the best decision for me. I know another friend who went this route and after sharing my story many more friends are interested in becoming single moms by choice. It\u2019s not that I don\u2019t want a partner, I just didn\u2019t want my opportunity to become a mother to pass me by in the meantime.\u201c(The article) made me happy to know that more women are not afraid to say how they conceived their babies outside of \u201ctraditional relationships.\u201d That we are taking control of our lives, our fertility and bringing babies into this world that are wanted and loved before they are even conceived.\u201d\u201cBlessed and fortunate to have my own modern family thanks to surrogacy.\u201cOur dream of having a baby started in 2014, the year we got married. We found a surrogacy agency in an IVF practice in Connecticut. We were matched with our first surrogate in 2015 and she got pregnant right away, but sadly she had a miscarriage at eight-and-a-half weeks. We were devastated and upset, naturally, but we knew we didn\u2019t want to give up because we really wanted to have a baby. So we waited and we tried again and were matched with another surrogate in 2016 and she also got pregnant right away, but this time she carried the baby to 38-and-a-half weeks and we had Chelsea.\u201cWe feel really lucky and fortunate to have Chelsea because we know how difficult it can be to have a baby in untraditional ways. Even if you have all the means and resources necessary that doesn\u2019t always guarantee a baby. \u201c\u201cMy name is Jo Zmood. I am a single mum of two now. Originally from Australia \u2013 hence \u201cmum\u201d not \u201cmom.\u201d I\u2019ve lived in New York for 10 years, and while there are many books out there that talk about different types of families I couldn\u2019t quite find the right book to share with my son to provide him some explanation of my choice to bring him into this world alone. So I wrote my own story for him. The article inspired me to share it.\u201cHe never asked any questions and understands some of his friends have dads and some don\u2019t. I wanted to answer his question of why he doesn\u2019t, regardless of whether the question is posed. And to let him know the subject was not taboo.\u201d\u201cDuring the three years I struggled to get pregnant with my second child as a solo parent, people close to me asked if I should consider the failed pregnancies a sign to give up. I was not giving up. The years of navigating fibroid tumors, surgeries and infertility finally came to an end with the birth of my second son, Oliver. He was born with my eggs and the help of my cousin as my surrogate. My journey as a solo parent also ended when I met my husband right before learning my surrogate was pregnant with Oliver. We were both solo parents in our 40s and had never been married before. Our journey to building a family may not have taken a typical path, but what we have today is my dream come true.\u201dKim Overton writes about her experience on\u201cWhen I was younger I was told that I didn\u2019t have enough estrogen to be able to carry a pregnancy. My ex-husband couldn\u2019t have children either so we adopted two babies within three years. The marriage ended a few years later and I remarried the following year. My new husband and I started our married life with two 4-year-olds and a 2-year-old.\u201cThen the surprises came. I had babies at age 35, 39, and 46 \u2013 \u2013 all conceived the old-fashioned way!\u201d\u201cI am a US-Belgian dual citizen, single mom, living in Brussels After many failed attempts (albeit fun) at a real relationship, I decided to have a child on my own. Having a supportive family, especially my sister living in Belgium, was one of the reasons I did not hesitate to go solo.\u201cWhen the adoption agency called me saying that they had received the picture of my daughter, I ran to go see her photo.\u201cAfter an exhausting trip, arrived late into the night in Changsha, capital of the Hunan province, we went to the office of child affairs, or something of the sort, and each waited until we were called and they brought the babies out one by one. I looked at her as they were putting her in my arms, the most amazing and unreal feeling possible. She cried right away and I put a pacifier in her mouth and it calmed her right away.\u201cWhat I remember most, is putting her on a chair in the hotel room and just staring at this little bundle of baby and saying, I cannot believe she is mine! The wait had not been too long (seven months for China to pair me up with Lynne and from the start of the process of first meeting with the agency to the file being sent was about 12 months, so all in all, about one-and-a-half years \u2013 so not too long).\u201d\u201cShe got attached to me immediately and when we were in the dining hall, I could not even leave her in her buggy to get food, she had to come with me and see me. The nannies had told me that she was always crawling behind one or the other person at the orphanage so she had to be in someone\u2019s company at all times.\u201cShe still does not like being alone! She loves being close to me and needs company to be happy, even if now, as a teen, she can spend hours in her room doing who knows what! I call her my little pot of glue.\u201cAdopting is not easy. I mean being a single mom, making all the decisions, is hard. And having a smart child, ahead of her years for some things, is challenging to say the least. Also, an abandoned child\u2019s brain develops differently and this is why sometimes, they rebel against us and make life very hard. They try, albeit unconsciously, to do all they can to push us away. They are repeating the abandonment they felt as a child. But you have to hold fast, hold on and show you are always there. But it\u2019s tough when they bite and scratch and break things, kick you etc \u2026 But with the help of family, psychologists and relational therapy, you get it done. And now, although she\u2019s a typical teenager, we have a lot of good times.\u201cWhat she wants the most is spending time with me, so when we can, we travel. We\u2019ve been to Burkina Faso,  Mexico, China (went back to do some volunteer teaching for 3 months in 2009 near Qingdao), all over Europe, California, New York, Atlanta, South Carolina, Boston, Cuba \u2026 She has a map on her wall with pins of all the places she\u2019s been. We\u2019d like to go to Japan next!\u201cAll in all, being a mom is the toughest job. It is also the most rewarding. I do not know how they decide which parent gets which child in China, but I would not have wanted any other. It had to be her, no one else. I love her with all my heart. And I do get the love back. Those few moments when she shows her love with no boundaries are worth all the pain I go through to be her mom. I\u2019d do it all the same if I had to. Would not change a thing!\u201d\u201cWe have the most beautiful miracle from IVF. Go Science! I\u2019m a Chinese dentist, mom is a Hispanic dietitian. My wife had endometriosis, hence we needed IVF.\u201cTuko has been to six countries before he turned 2 \u2013 proud papa!\u201d\u201cI am a single parent by choice. I decided at 25 that I wanted to adopt. It was something that was important to me, so I did. Not all of my family and friends were on board, but I knew it\u2019s what I was meant to do. The process was faster and smoother than I could have ever imagined. My son was in my arms just four months after my home study was completed. We maintain a relationship with his birth family, which I am very thankful for. Although it hasn\u2019t been easy, it has been worth it. He brings so much joy to myself and my family. He\u2019s such a wonderful, loving little boy.\u00a0\u00a0Even those that weren\u2019t on board with my choice to pursue adoption at such a young age are just simply amazed at how incredibly perfect he is for our family. We love him with every ounce of our being.\u201cThe one aspect of the adoption that I feel I wasn\u2019t prepared for was the current environment that I am raising a black son in. I have always tried to be a strong advocate for the AA community and to stay educated, but never really understood what it meant to be black in America until I saw the world through my son\u2019s eyes. Although I still don\u2019t fully understand, as I myself am shielded with my own privilege, my eyes have been opened. Sometimes painfully so. I worry about him every day. But, he is my world and I would do it again in a heart beat.\u201d"

        "text": "Editor\u2019s Note:to get our weekly column as a newsletter. We\u2019re looking back at the strongest, smartestof the week from CNN and other outlets.Which film will win the Oscar for best picture? Will Republicans trounce Democrats in the midterm elections? And what country will take home the most gold medals at the Beijing Winter Olympics?As we begin the new year, CNN Opinion has once again asked a fearless group of contributorsabout some of the biggest political, cultural and sports-related moments to come.Though many of the previous year\u2019s contributors successfully predicted key political and sporting outcomes, onlythe winners of nearly all of the entertainment questions we posed \u2013and.From predicting \u201cNomadland\u201d would win the Oscar for best picture to betting Taylor Swift\u2019s \u201cFolklore\u201d would win the Grammy for album of the year,andproved themselves the most formidable oracles of the year. This was particularly impressive given that movie theaters and music venues remained closed for much of 2020 \u2013 and the opportunities to see films and listen to live music were limited.Will their success last into the new year?andon their 2022 entertainment picks. Whileis predicting \u201cWest Side Story,\u201d Steven Spielberg\u2019s first foray into musicals, will take home the Oscar,argues the buzzworthy film \u201cDon\u2019t Look Up\u201d is better positioned for the top cinematic award. \u201cAnyone who\u2019s anyone in Hollywood is in it,\u201d she explains.But the most popular selection this year is \u201cBelfast,\u201d a film that chronicles the life of a working-class family in Northern Ireland in 1969. Seven of our prognosticators are betting on the film\u2019s moving narrative, compelling cinematography and young breakout star, Jude Hill.Last year, 10 out of 18 contributorsthat Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock would win their runoffs for the US Senate in Georgia. This year, 10 out of 18 of our contributors (though not the same 10) predict Democratsduring the 2022 midterms. If \u201chistory is the guide here,\u201d writes, \u201cit\u2019s hard to see how it\u2019s not Republicans winning control of both houses.\u201d Indeed, withthe party in the White House tends to lose congressional seats in the midterm elections.But other variables are compounding the Democrats\u2019 electoral problems. Growing, the ongoing challenges of the pandemic and Biden\u2019spresent a perfect political storm for liberals running for reelection. Based on those factors alone,concludes Republicans will \u201csweep\u201d both the House and the Senate., who was among those tothe Georgia Senate races last year, writes that while she, too, predicts Republicans will take control of both chambers, \u201cthe margin will be minimal \u2013 giving every member of Congress enormous power.\u201d And her political prognostications may be worth paying extra attention to, since Ghitis came closest to predicting Biden\u2019s approval rating at the end of 2021 \u2013 45%, according to CNN\u2019s poll of polls.This year,and 11 others are predicting Biden\u2019s approval rating will hover in the 40-percentage range, as he attempts to navigate the country through the next phase of pandemic recovery., who predicts the President\u2019s approval rating at the end of 2022 will be 48%, says at least he will be in familiar company: \u201cObama\u2019s approval was at 48% at the end of 2010, even after the shellacking he took in the midterms.\u201dOur oracleson which album will win the Grammy\u2019s top prize. Many chose Olivia Rodrigo\u2019s \u201cSour,\u201d but Lil Nas X\u2019s \u201cMontero\u201d and Tony Bennett and Lady Gaga\u2019s \u201cLove for Sale\u201d also were mentioned.cites her children\u2019s preference for playing Rodrigo\u2019s album nonstop, whilesays she was sold on \u201cSour\u201d as soon as she heard \u201cDrivers License,\u201d the wildly popular track from Rodrigo\u2019s debut studio album.thinks \u201cMontero\u201d deserves the top prize. She writes that Lil Nas X\u2019s album is \u201cthought-provoking, bold and sexy. Lil Nas isn\u2019t just a champion for the LGBTQ+ community, he\u2019s a champion for the world I want to see.\u201d And whiledoubts Lil Nas X will ultimately be victorious, he agrees with Jones, saying, \u201cNo one has challenged the pop establishment more.\u201dsays Bennett and Gaga should win. He writes the Grammys will have to recognize their \u201cvocal chemistry\u201d and award them best album as \u201ca sweet coda to Bennett\u2019s incredible career.\u201dthinks Reyes may just be right \u2013 if for no other reason than a \u201csentimental\u201d one.For all the division over the film and music awards, there is a surprising consensus around the shows that will take the Emmys. More than three-quarters of our contributors expect \u201cSuccession\u201d to win for best drama. Asexplains, \u201cAfter offering the entertaining psyches of damaged souls, along with the palliative claim that the uber-rich and powerful are not really happy,\u201d the drama on HBO (which, like CNN, is owned by WarnerMedia) has got to win the top prize. Almost as many writers expect \u201cTed Lasso\u201d to win best comedy for the second year in a row.If there is one question our oracles are good at answering, it\u2019s which country will win the most medals at the Olympics. Nearly all of 2021\u2019s contributorsthe United States as the biggest winner at the Tokyo summer games.While a majority of them think the United States will once again claim the top prize at the Beijing Winter Games,, who has an impressiveof choosing sports winners,will come first in the medal count. She writes, \u201cAs much as I\u2019d love to see the United States at the top, I have to go with Norway [on this one].\u201dargues the Scandinavian country is a \u201cwinter sports powerhouse.\u201dAnd if there is one sport that our contributors can agree the United States will not win, it\u2019s soccer. Half of them believe Brazil will triumph at the World Cup in Qatar next November, while the rest are mostly divided between France and England., the lone Brit among our contributors, is rooting for her own country, in part because she likes the team\u2019s manager, Gareth Southgate. She reasons, he \u201chas put together a brilliant group of young players, who are as lovely as the fans make them out to be\u2026 The natural next step is a World Cup win.\u201dWith the Major League Baseballongoing, it remains unclear if and when the 2022 season will begin. But assuming the owners and players are able to reach some sort of agreement,, whothe Atlanta Braves would win last year\u2019s World Series,will be this year\u2019s world champion team.She is the only contributor to pick a Texas team.is betting the Los Angeles Dodgers, who last won the World Series in 2020, will come out on top because they \u201chave a solid and balanced roster ready to roll.\u201d\u2013 along with three others \u2013 has her sights set on the New York Mets. She explains that \u201cin pro-baseball, money often buys happiness, and theya whole bunch of it at pitcher Max Scherzer.\u201dAs for the NFL, nine of our contributors believe quarterback Tom Brady is unbeatable and will lead the Tampa Bay Buccaneers to another Super Bowl victory. Asputs it, \u201cBrady makes all of us 40-somethings look bad and will keep winning Super Bowls until he\u2019s 70.\u201d And while that may be aexaggeration, it\u2019s clear that our football oracles are looking to the past in making predictions about the future.That said, a mighty but vocal minority believes the Green Bay Packers will be the 2022 Super Bowl champions.writes Aaron Rodgers, the team\u2019s quarterback, will \u201credeem himself\u201d in February, when the big game is played, whileargues the Packers are \u201clong overdue\u201d for a Super Bowl win.Nearly two years into the pandemic, the world is still struggling to curtail the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes Covid-19. The recent emergence of anew variant \u2013 Omicron \u2013 has only complicated those efforts.It has also added more uncertainty to the employment market. For the final question of this year\u2019s Crystal Ball, we asked our contributors when, if at all, the US will return to pre-pandemic employment numbers. While a majority of our contributors think the US labor marketin 2022, there are those likewho predict a recovery by July \u2013 with one caveat. \u201cEven when unemployment hits pre-pandemic levels, it will probably disguise a great deal of lasting damage,\u201d including people in \u201cpart-time work or low-paid work,\u201d she says.Meanwhile, others, likeand, predict that it could take until 2023 \u2013 at the earliest \u2013 before the labor market fully rebounds. Asexplains, \u201cthe country is in a different place post-pandemic,\u201d and it will take significantly more time before out-of-work Americans are able to rejoin some of the industries most impacted by Covid-19.::::::::::In the final weeks of 2021, Covid-19 reminded us of its persistence as the fast-spreading Omicron variant upended travel and other plans around the world. Amid this latest surge, it would be a mistake not to acknowledge the group that has perhaps faced the most challenges during this pandemic \u2013 health care workers. Now, with rising caseloads and hospitalizations, these medical professionalsonce again.While many doctors and nurses are physically and emotionally exhausted, they still remain committed to treating those who seek their care. Michigan-based emergency room nurse, who recently lost her unvaccinated uncle to Covid-19, said as much in: \u201cMy beloved community, I want YOU to know\u2026 On our backs we will carry you. No matter your beliefs, your choices, your lifestyle, your past. Our legs grow tired, and we beg for your help, but we will continue to carry you until this race is over, my friends.\u201dWhen asked if that same kindness really extended to everyone \u2013 regardless of their politics and likely vaccination status \u2013 Wendt, inwith CNN Opinion\u2019s, emphasized her commitment was unwavering. \u201cI\u2019ve held so many people\u2019s hands while they are dying, and nobody\u2019s talking about who they voted for,\u201d she said. \u201cIt pains me that in all of the political talk, we can\u2019t see a bigger picture here.\u201dAs we work to turn Covid-19 from pandemic to endemic, Wendt\u2019s lesson \u2013 about finding the humanity in one another \u2013 is worth carrying into the new year."

        "text": "Editor\u2019s Note:In this weekly column \u201cCross Exam,\u201d Elie Honig, a CNN legal analyst and former federal and state prosecutor, gives his take on the latest legal news. Post your questions below. The views expressed in this commentary are his own. View moreon CNN. Watch Honig answer readers\u2019 questions on \u201cCNN Newsroom with Ana Cabrera\u201d at 5:40 p.m. ET Sundays.Wednesday\u2019sagainst Derek Chauvin and three other former Minneapolis Police Department officers involved in the death of George Floyd are an important step toward justice. Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison did the right thing, and the necessary thing, by upgrading the top charge against Chauvin, and by bringing serious charges against the other three officers as well.County-level prosecutors originally charged Chauvin last week within a complaint that was rife with subtlystatements and omissions. Third-degree murder carries a maximum penalty of 25 years and requires proof that the defendant committed an act \u201ceminently dangerous to others and evincing a depraved mind, without regard for human life.\u201d In other words, a third-degree charge requires prosecutors to show that Chauvin acted recklessly and dangerously, without necessarily intending to kill Floyd.Ellison took over the case shortly thereafter, reportedly atand now he has addressed a shortcoming in the original complaint by charging Chauvin with a more seriouscount, which carries a potential 40-year sentence. Ellison used a smart tactic here by charging what is known as \u201cfelony murder.\u201d That means the defendant intentionally committed some felony \u2013 here, assault \u2013 and that a death resulted.  Thus, prosecutors need to prove that Chauvin intentionally assaulted Floyd, but not necessarily that Chauvin intended to kill him.The publicly-available evidence looks sufficient to sustain this charge. Chauvin kept his knee on Floyd\u2019s neck for 8 minutes and 46 seconds, including three full minutes after Floyd stopped moving and nearly two minutes after he apparentlyDuring the full eight-plus minutes, Floyd audibly stated, \u201cI can\u2019t breathe,\u201d \u201cmama,\u201dandI believe that evidence is sufficient to show an intentional killing \u2013 and all the prosecution must establish here is an intentional assault, with death resulting.As a safety net, prosecutors also have charged Chauvin withEven if the jury does not convict on the top charge (the second-degree murder), it still can find Chauvin guilty on one or both of these lesser charges. He isand is scheduled to appear in court later this month.The other three officers now face charges of accomplice liability for aiding and abetting Chauvin in committing second-degree murder and manslaughter. Under Minnesota law, anyone who assists another in committing a crime is guilty just as if he committed the crime with his own hands. In one sense, these charges will be more difficult to prove than the charges against Chauvin, because Chauvin\u2019s conduct is more direct and will be more palpable to a jury.  But, in another sense, the bar is lower; if prosecutors can prove that theknowingly assisted Chauvin even in some small way, they too are guilty. Aappears to show two of the other officers also kneeling on Floyd.Ellison correctly noted that trying the case will not be easy andHe\u2019s right. We have not yet heard what the defenses will be, but rest assured, each defendant will have capable counsel fighting every inch of the way. Trial juries are inherently unpredictable; anybody who tells you any trial is a sure thing has never tried a case.Much still lies ahead. The case next will go to a grand jury, followed by pre-trial discovery and motions, and ultimately, trial. Justice remains well down the road. Still, Wednesday\u2019s charging decisions are an important step towards that end goal."

        "link": "https://edition.cnn.com/2018/03/20/opinions/caregiving-what-its-like-to-be-me-wes-ely-opinion/index.html",
        "text": "Editor\u2019s Note:This piece is the third part of a CNN Opinion series, \u201c,\u201d which explores the personal struggles Americans face at a time of profound social change.is a physician and the Grant. W. Liddle Professor of Medicine and Critical Care at Vanderbilt University, T, and the founder of the Vanderbilt. The views expressed here are solely his.\u201cBut can\u2019t you help me die, Doc?\u201dMy 54-year-old patient was alone in the intensive care unit, with no family or friends in his life. He slumped in his bed, gasping, staring up at me. Admitted with lung fibrosis and pneumonia, he had scars and infection aggressively replacing his airways, despite our best treatments.As a newly minted doctor years ago, my mind was usually occupied with beeps and buzzers providing me technical information to help calculate choices about patients\u2019 care. Having developed gray hair over many years at the bedside, my first priority is now more straightforward: to hear the voices of the vulnerable people looking up at me from their bed.  That is what I try to do as a physician, including, of course, what they tell me in the silences.I pulled a chair next to his bed so we could talk at eye level.  His face was blank.  \u201cI want euthanasia. I\u2019m going to die soon, so what\u2019s the point of living longer? I\u2019m just wasted space.\u201dI felt nauseated.  The illegality of euthanasia was not what ran through my mind.  Instead I thought about how Paul had lost his sense of personhood. I thought about how I had chosen to become a doctor in the first place.I chose medicine as my calling after a childhood spent in the Deep South: Shreveport, Louisiana. My mother taught English there after my father, an engineer, had left her for another woman. I remember it was so hot that my siblings and I would fry eggs on the sidewalk. No joke. On most days, we\u2019d walk to a nearby bayou and catch baby alligators for fun and fill up coolers with crawfish for dinner. That last part is important because we had no money at all. Dad wouldn\u2019t pay anything to Mom, who didn\u2019t make much as a teacher.  So I started working at the farm of a man who wanted to marry my mother. I worked 14-hour days from about five in the morning doing square bales of hay until seven at night picking vegetables and running the country store.While I cherish those years and the formation that grueling work provided, I was determined to do something different with my life.  Mom told me that Dad had loved math and science, and she taught literature. So I figured it must come naturally for me to split the difference and do something with people, science and the arts. To me, that meant medicine.I remember our first big assignment in sixth grade was to write a research paper on what we would be when we grew up. I rode my beat-up bicycle to the local library and began reading about how to become a physician: What was the process and what would it all mean? I walked out of the library that day having spent most of my time reading a long medical essay about truth. The author insisted that to be a physician, one has constantly to seek truth about the patient\u2019s diagnosis, the best treatment, and the best way to serve each and every person. What I learned from the essay was that truth doesn\u2019t change depending on our ability to stomach it. As I progressed through Jesuit high school and Tulane, this became a common theme in my pursuit of a life as a doctor: \u201cWrong is wrong even if everybody is wrong. Right is right even if nobody is right.\u201d Numerous people are credited with some version of this quote, from actors to philosophers to theologians. That sense of truth drove my study and training and my realization that each person\u2019s life has value beyond measure.I knew long before I met Paul that I couldn\u2019t kill another person just because he or she wanted me to, but I still had to find a way to respond to Paul\u2019s request to die.My response came in parts over my days with him.  First, I explained that, as his physician, I wanted to be with him through the dying process. I told him that I considered us to be in a mutual covenant.  We both had a degree of autonomy that had to be respected, but I would never intentionally harm him. \u201cPaul, our covenant includes my limiting your suffering,\u201d I said.  \u201cYou are the best judge of when you need more meds for pain, anxiety and breathing. All of us will work day and night to end your distress, but we won\u2019t deliberately end your life.\u201dWith our eyes locked, Paul gave his instruction: \u201cJust don\u2019t abandon me.\u201d  And we sat there, as partners.As a physician, there is no better place to be.  Perhaps especially amid the uncertainty, we must learn to partner with each person in the bonds of this two-way relationship.  He in need of help and me in need of helping.Paul was receiving excellent palliative care for his physical symptoms, but it wasn\u2019t enough.  It never is. Emotional isolation and despair can cast a shadow darker than disease.  Physicians fail our patients on a human level.  We forget that our patients are more than the sum of their medical conditions, so I asked Paul about other types of therapy \u2014 art, music, spirituality, pets, sunshine \u2014 that might help him.\u201cI want my music.  Can you get me the soundtrack for \u2018Lord of the Rings\u2019?\u201d  Within minutes we had the songs playing in his room, and his demeanor changed from desolate to alert and engaged.  \u201cI love music. It\u2019s always been a motivator, but now \u2026 I don\u2019t know.\u201d He shifted in his bed. \u201cMy goals are gone.\u201dNietzsche\u2019s words came to my mind, \u201cHe who has a \u2018why\u2019 to live can bear almost any \u2018how.\u2019\u201d, as a physician-survivor of Auschwitz, used Nietzsche\u2019s quote four times in his crucial analysis, \u201cMan\u2019s Search for Meaning.\u201d I think this book should be required reading for medical students.As with many patients, Paul\u2019s story needed unpacking. \u201cPaul, what did you do in life?\u201dHe smiled and shrugged. \u201cI\u2019m a rare beast: a plumber who acts.  I do Shakespeare festivals.  You know, \u2018The quality of mercy is not strained.\u2019  I\u2019ve been mulling over that line.  Years ago I didn\u2019t understand it.  I do now.  Mercy should not be forced.  It\u2019s better as a natural infusion, one person to another.\u201dI described for Paul the many years I spent alongside my single-mom-turned-Shakespeare-director, helping her cue actors.  As we talked, I watched his erratic oxygen levels fall and then partially recover, obliging us to take breaks.  Sweat would build up on his forehead, and, more than once, I worried that our conversation was too much of a strain. But we were unpacking, and it was essential.That night I asked Christine, a nurse who loves theater, to sit and talk with Paul.  Soon their lives were interwoven, too.\u201cI think I helped Christine,\u201d Paul said the next day. \u201cMy own illness made me forget that one of my \u2018things\u2019 is seeing when someone is hurting. And Christine is. She came to help me, but it turns out some really personal things in our background are weirdly similar.  I told her my way through the worst of it.\u201d He paused, his thoughts far away.It seemed like a good time to return to his previous request.  \u201cPaul, you\u2019ve asked for euthanasia, and you brought up Portia\u2019s line from \u2018Merchant of Venice\u2019 about mercy.  Can we talk about these things?\u201d  He nodded, and closed his eyes.\u201cWe all want to be here with you in your suffering.  I want your opinion: I don\u2019t think injecting you with a lethal drug would be truly merciful, but it would, in every sense of the word, be \u2018strained.\u2019 It would be a forced and unnatural \u2018false\u2019 mercy.  Whenever possible, mercy must also be lifting and healing.  I don\u2019t want to abandon those key elements in serving you.\u201dHis eyes opened wide. \u201cDoc, talking with you and Christine about life\u2019s best and worst times has helped.\u201d  He took a deep breath, and I heard the whoosh of high-flow oxygen into his nostrils.  \u201cThings I confided to Christine are helping her sort through her own struggles. She said she\u2019s coming back tonight, and that means the world to me.\u201d  Then, unwittingly, Paul paraphrased Nietzsche: \u201cWhen we met, I was afraid of being a burden and not mattering. Now I feel different. I\u2019m not a believer like others, but I guess I remembered the \u2018why\u2019 to live.\u201dShort of a war zone, there are few settings as raw as an ICU.  Yet treasured moments of human transformation come when people like Paul rediscover their \u201cwhy,\u201d even if just for an hour or a day.I see many paths toward survival in the ICU, and for non-survivors, myriad paths toward death: sudden, prolonged, stuttering, reluctant, stoical \u2013 and these paths are dynamic, not static.It is a rare patient who asks me for euthanasia, but it is nearly universal that dying patients seek help with suffering.  Sitting on their beds brings me right up against their fears, the greatest of which is usually not intolerable pain.Lack of control is what bothers people the most, and it drives most requests for euthanasia, which is predominantly a first-world phenomenon.  As we have gained more and more ability to dictate so many aspects of our lives, looking ahead in uncertainty has become something people are not willing to tolerate.  As a physician, I find this is a very important \u201cteachable moment\u201d for most patients: helping them (and me) to live in the moment. Whitewashed along a wall in the home for destitute and dying in Kolkata, these words of Saint Mother Teresa became emblazoned in my mind, and I recalled them for Paul: \u201cYesterday is gone. Tomorrow has not yet come. We have only today. Let us begin.\u201d He nodded in agreement.Paul reminded me that the best remedy for angst is human relationship and community.The problem with assisted suicide and euthanasia for Paul \u2014 and for others \u2014 is that it presented him with an illusion of \u2018cure,\u2019 when in reality it would have left him devoid of the healing he received.And alongside the patient, of course, sits the physician.  The problem for me with intentionally administering lethal medications to end the life of another person is that it would rob me as a healer.  I would be qualitatively changed.  If I were ever to assume that I had authority over life to take it deliberately, it would, for me, create an irrevocable cavern of emptiness.  The infinite worth of every person outprices autonomy: What you and I want is less important than who we are.Obviously, the approach I took with Paul won\u2019t be an answer for everyone, yet it is too often left untried.  Some will say Paul\u2019s story is merely an uplifting anecdote. Nevertheless, I hope to embrace the lessons I learned at his bedside for most of my patients, and I hope my colleagues do the same.We are sent to heal even when cure is not possible.  What we should be trying to heal is often not physical disease or clinical depression, but a person\u2019s sense of insignificance and hopelessness, which we cannot heal by eliminating the person.Paul died a week later. By then he realized his life was of value even with a terminal disease. In fact, the last thing he said to me, between gasps, was: \u201cI\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t miss this time. I never saw it coming, Doc. \u2026 In losing my breath, I gained it.\u201d"

        "text": "Editor\u2019s Note:Sarah Lenti is a political strategist and policy advisor at SML Advisory Partners. She served as a director on the National Security Council under Condoleezza Rice and worked as a lead researcher for Mitt Romney\u2019s 2010 book, \u201cNo Apology: The Case for American Greatness.\u201d  The views expressed in this commentary are her own. This piece is the first of a CNN Opinion series, \u201c,\u201d which explores the personal struggles Americans face at a time of profound social change.Top Republican strategist Sarah Lenti details how \u2014 against her family's wishes and conservative values \u2014  she decided to undergo IVF to become a single parentAfter being told she had less than a 5% chance of conceiving -- 3.7% in fact -- she gave birth to two baby boys, Eli and Abel.It was a year ago when a young woman stopped me in a neighborhood shop. She gazed at my stroller and started crying. She told me how lucky I was to be married with kids.My heart dropped. She didn\u2019t know me at all.I am a single mother by choice. Yet I was raised in a Christian, conservative home, where I grew up believing in the traditional family unit. And I was taught that there was an order to achieving it. First, fall in love. Second, marry a man. Third, start a family.Now in my fifth decade, only one has proven true for me \u2013 and it isn\u2019t the first.On the day that I turned 30, I journaled that I would think about becoming a mother should I still be single at 38. What that looked like, I didn\u2019t exactly know. It was a promise to myself, maybe to God.At the time, I was in a terrible relationship with a man who told me he wanted to be with me, but he could never love me. It was because of those words that I first clung to the idea of motherhood. Maybe a man could deny me love, but he would never deny me a child.Fast forward to my 38th birthday. I was still single, and the world of dating had changed significantly in the last eight years. Tinder and Bumble, the dominant dating apps, offered countless options for single men and women, but made the experience of dating entirely impersonal.Dating amounted to small talk with a stranger, who you had briefly interfaced with online because you each thought the other attractive. The small talk was a prelude to hooking up, and there were no expectations even of a text the next day.It was brutal. And after trying my hand at it, I was no closer to finding the love of my life or starting a family.If I needed statistics to back me up, I had them. In 2014,was on the decline, as was thein the United States.I had one real option left \u2013 and that was to attempt to get pregnant alone.Maybe I didn\u2019t deserve a family, or so many of the subscribers to my conservative Christian values might say. And maybe the men with whom I had been involved didn\u2019t view me as acceptable wife/mother material.But deep down I felt differently and decided to give myself one shot.And so I started the process of in vitro fertilization (IVF). I was mentally prepared for the physical havoc that would ensue, and I had saved every penny for it \u2013 to the tune of $30,000.Tinder and Bumble, the dominant dating apps, offered countless options for single men and women, but made the experience of dating entirely impersonal.But why didn\u2019t I adopt? After all, even if I were fortunate enough to have a child, the child would be fatherless. And many, myself included, believe this places the child in a precarious situation.That said, at least with IVF my potential child would be biologically related to me, his or her grandparents and cousins. The child might not have a father, but he or she would have a strong bloodline.  I hoped this would help ease any future struggle for my child.The very decade I was born into \u2013 the glorious 70\u2019s \u2013 ushered in the science and technology that might allow me to conceive. Alone.More specifically, 1978 was the year that the first human being was born through the process of embryo creation outside of the womb, then implantation inside of the womb, pregnancy and successful birth. Since that time, IVF has produced approximately, with nearly 1 million of those being born in the United States.The IVF pool is quite minuscule compared to total US births \u2013 for example, in 2011, only 0.7% of all US births were attributed to IVF. That said, and barely optimistic, I was committed to the process, or so I thought.And yet there I was  at a bar in Los Angeles, a month out from IVF, crying in front of two people I barely knew, but knew well enough to unload to.My life was great on paper. I had done all the right things. I went to Stanford for graduate school. I worked at the White House under Condoleezza Rice. I had the opportunity to travel the world. I had loving parents and two wonderful sisters.And yet I felt unloved \u2013 even unlovable. And also greatly conflicted.On the one hand, I was ecstatic \u2013 I was weeks away from my shot at becoming a biological mom. I started thinking about this potential path nine years ago and had been setting aside money for five years. I was in love with idea of having a family and giddy at the thought of the unknown.But there was doubt. Goodness, there was doubt. There was that little voice inside my head \u2013 the voice of my parents and others \u2013 that was very much alive in me. \u201cWhy would you purposely bring a child into the world without a father? Are you really that lonely? How would that child feel one day?\u201dThroughout my upbringing, I was told that it\u2019s wrong to play God. And, as recently as the previous Christmas Eve, I was told that bringing a child into the world without a father was selfish.My heart and my brain had to fight back.No, I was not that lonely. No, I was not that selfish.  Actually, it was waking up single, every single day of my life \u2013 only to be greeted by my career \u2013 that felt selfish. And while I could never speak for the feelings that my future child might have, I took solace in the belief that any child would be happy to be alive if he or she were sincerely loved.Throughout my upbringing, I was told that it\u2019s wrong to play God. And, as recently as the previous Christmas Eve, I was told that bringing a child into the world without a father was selfish.As I drew nearer to the implantation date, the prospect of creating a tiny human grew more real and began to override any lingering doubt.And so, on August 29, 2014, I asked my doctor to implant two embryos. He wisely asked me to justify two. I was quick to answer. If I were lucky enough to get pregnant with twins \u2013 what a gift for them. They may not have a father, but they would always have each other.I knew the statistics and did not expect to get pregnant. Given my age and the means of conception, I was praying for the long shot of one, knowing two would be a miracle.The 2014 Assisted Reproductive Technology National Summary Report, as published by the US Department of Health and Human Services, is a humbling reminder of just how small the odds were during the year that I attempted to conceive. In 2014, a woman of my age, using fresh non-donor eggs with no previous pregnancies, had an 18.8% chance of pregnancy resulting in a live birth. When it came to percentages of cycles resulting in twin lives births, the success rate plummeted to 3.7%.Yes, I had a 3.7% chance of success.Of course, before the IVF process could begin, I had to choose a donor \u2013 and let\u2019s just say I took a less than conventional approach.Given my professional background as a conservative politico, I think people expect me to say that IQ, number of educational degrees and political association were at the top of my donor qualifications list. Not the case.I was looking for someone who I would be attracted to if we were procreating in the traditional way.I know this must sound incredibly superficial. But, let\u2019s be frank, it\u2019s impossible to gauge true intellect or a kind heart by virtue of an online donor search.And so I began my search with a focus on the physical attributes that I have always been attracted to \u2013 namely height and athleticism. Six-foot-2 and toned was my baseline.The donor was a collegiate lacrosse athlete. I was able to see three pictures, from tot to teen, of an adorable boy with an incredible smile, unruly hair and a twinkle in his eyes. (This particular bank did not allow adult pictures of the donor for legal reasons. So, at the end of the day, the attraction part of my search was also a gamble.)I was searching for my version of good genes, who also looks good in jeans \u2013 at least on paper.I finished my search on the scientific side of things. The donor bank I chose provided a full medical history and genetic testing results. Honestly, why wouldn\u2019t you opt for a donor with no heart disease, cancer, mental illness or any other serious genetic conditions in his family history?This is the one distinct advantage of going the donor route as opposed to the good old-fashioned route when conceiving. While I haven\u2019t polled my married or attached friends, I am 99.9% certain that not a single one queried their partner about the specifics of their family\u2019s medical history prior to sleeping with them or accepting a marriage proposal.I was searching for my version of good genes, who also looks good in jeans \u2013 at least on paper.In early September, my blood work came back with hormone levels signaling pregnancy. I was in shock, but I had eight long weeks to go until seeing if there was a heartbeat or two. I started to take a pregnancy test every evening. It was the longest 56 days of my life.D-Day finally arrived. And, there on the sonogram screen right in front of me, was the most beautiful thing: my child\u2019s heartbeat, strong and steady.I had a million immediate questions for the sonographer and started right in. She stopped me, because there was heartbeat number two. Wait, what? I was laughing and crying at the same time. This must be what joy feels like, I thought.The clich\u00e9 that I despise most is: It will happen when you least expect it. Nonsense. I had gone almost 40 years expecting nothing in terms of dating, love and, God forbid, a husband \u2013 and I received exactly that in return.But suddenly the least expected had happened. I was pregnant with twins.My journal entry from the evening read as follows:On a Friday morning roughly 30 weeks after implantation, something seemed wrong. I had such severe leg cramps that I was crawling around the apartment on my hands and knees. I called an Uber at 8:30 am. Never having taken any birthing classes, I had no idea what the onset of labor looked like.By the time I got to the hospital the pain was so intense that I could barely make it to the door. The Uber driver offered to help me up. I was immediately checked in and within minutes was told that I was 7 cm dilated and would be headed into an emergency C-section.My heart stopped. I was petrified that those little heartbeats were going to stop and that my sons \u2013 my sons \u2013 were not going to make it. I was alone in the pre-delivery room just long enough to run through every awful scenario in my head.And then it was time. Seventy minutes after arrival, I was wheeled into a room with a team of 16 doctors and nurses waiting for me. The sight of this army, the two waiting incubators and all the other metal contraptions made me well up. I had no idea what was going to happen next, but I had never expected it to happen quite like this \u2013 not this early, not with these many medical professionals and not entirely on my own.Eli and Abel have proven to be the embodiment of that saying you always hear \u2013 the hardest, yet best thing I\u2019ve ever done.Doctors and nurses were working quickly all around me. Epidural, check. Babies\u2019 heart rates, check. Slicing me open, check. Ripping two crimson-colored sons out of me at 10:40 am and 10:43 am, check and check.I saw Eli and Abel for a nanosecond before the nurses cut the cords and rushed them to their incubator stations to begin inserting the breathing tubes. They were 10 weeks premature and neither could suck, swallow or breathe on their own.The two teams whisked my babies to the Level 4 NICU (neonatal intensive care unit) without me getting to touch their skin or ask if their vital signs were stable. I did hear them cry, which was a relief.  I just wish my sisters had been there to take a picture and help recount what happened. I can\u2019t ever get that moment back.Little did I know when I moved to Denver that I would be delivering twins two years later at Denver\u2019s premier NICU hospital \u2013 The Rocky Mountain Hospital for Children at Presbyterian St. Luke\u2019sI was not able to see my sons until nine very long hours after delivery. I walked into a room with two incubators housing my baby boys, who looked more like starved squirrels than the roly-poly infants that I had envisioned. All wired up, with IVs jutting out of the top of their skulls, they were absolutely perfect. Complete miracles from inception to emergency birth.And, of course, they chose Friday the 13th of March to scare the living hell out of me and fight their way onto this Earth.Two weeks after I was released from the hospital, I found myself sleeping in my Denver home of almost two years, as my boys lived and slept inside NICU \u2013 for 60 days straight.And though I could easily have felt alone \u2013 so removed from my two miracles \u2013 I didn\u2019t.Friends and family from across the country constantly checked in on me, calling, texting, writing me words of encouragement.And even once Eli and Abel were out of NICU, loving and supporting friends \u2013 and sometimes even strangers \u2013continued to shower us with kindness and affection.Initially, the NICU team was our rock. These complete strangers became the most significant and consequential people in the lives of my sons during their first two months. I will never be able to appropriately express my gratitude to the nurses and doctors who safeguarded their lives. Several are friends to this day.Then my personal trainer and his wife, the first people to visit me in the hospital, became the most trusted and consistent presence in our lives. From celebrating our birthdays, to helping with our apartment move, to Fourth of July and Super Bowl celebrations, to just being those adult ears that I need \u2013 Adam and Teri have been there for all of it.You wake up every morning with a mandate and desire to be a better parent to your children than you were the day before.The mother of twin boys, who lived steps away from me, became my sanity check. We were pregnant at the same time and delivered within weeks of each other. We met by fluke, thanks to a double stroller sighting in the alley.And the parents of my first employee proved invaluable, babysitting the boys on weekends so I could nap.I can\u2019t forget the British transplant, who regularly delivered homemade quiche on weeknights just because.More recently, though, the manager at the Palm (steakhouse) took care of my family. It was Thanksgiving night, and I took the twins for our first holiday f\u00eate as a family of three. In one of the most random acts of kindness, the manager worked her way to our table, poured me a glass of wine, helped feed the boys, shared a bit of her life story with me and then bought our meal. She did not know me.Most importantly, since the birth of Eli and Abel, my parents have fallen so completely in love with their grandsons that it\u2019s hard to fully put into words the intensity of their connection. What was at first an idea hard for my traditional parents to grasp, is now two, tiny human beings, who have my parents tightly wrapped around their little fingers. Though thousands of miles away, my parents \u2013 and my sisters \u2013 express their love and support constantly and in innumerable ways.There are incredible people in this world. My sons\u2019 existences have made that real to me.Eli and Abel have proven to be the embodiment of that saying you always hear \u2013 the hardest, yet best thing I\u2019ve ever done.My sons are my family and my future. They represent everything good, hopeful and hilarious about life. They smile and cheer when I walk into their room. They blow kisses and sneak hugs. They belly laugh when we dance. They cuddle up at night and put their heads in the crook of my neck.They also scream, bite and bang their heads on the floor when they\u2019re upset. They chuck their food when they don\u2019t like it. They act like the world is coming to an end at bath time. And they are a constant financial stress.  Being a single parent is hard as hell.But from my two little men, I quickly internalized that love is a verb. Love is an action and something you work at every single day. You wake up every morning with a mandate and desire to be a better parent to your children than you were the day before.They are my miracles, which I almost didn\u2019t allow to happen because of heartbreak, self-doubt and maybe even self-loathing.Speaking of love, friends like to tell me that there is a man out there \u2013 some wonderful man who will sweep me off my feet and be an excellent father. To that I say, please stop. Do I want to date? Of course. But I can honestly write that I have no expectations for love, and I certainly do not believe that there is a father out there for my sons. I am not waiting and hoping, because I have lost that hope.Why have I lost that hope? Truth be told, I have been vulnerable with a few men pre- and post-pregnancy. But rejection upon rejection by man after man will do it to you. Even when you are that aloof gal, who doesn\u2019t ask questions or have expectations of something real or long-term, it still ends. I guess you just lose your luster after awhile. It\u2019s my reality, and it never changes.And while we are on the topic of relationships, I would note that I will forever be perplexed by the rate of unsolicited and unexpected congratulatory communications from ex-boyfriends after years of no contact. These were the men who rejected me. These were the men who left after months or years of pretending and/or cheating.Mom writes children's book to explain IVF to her sonAfter the birth of my sons, these same men suddenly thought they had a green card to strike up conversation and ask for pictures of the twins. One suggested grabbing dinner in DC. One kindly offered to come to Colorado to help run errands, cook dinner or do whatever I needed.The attention was hard to digest. I once cried over these men. Perhaps this was a way of absolving their guilt for being dishonest or wasting my time? Perhaps they were sincerely happy for me, which would suggest that they did respect me after all? Perhaps they were feeling slighted or envious that I went it alone, without them? I\u2019ll never know.And, most importantly, I finally no longer care.Though I may never have a significant other, I do have my sons, who\u2019ve taken me from unloved to loved and from unlovable to lovable. They\u2019ve done this all on their own. They are my miracles, which I almost didn\u2019t allow to happen because of heartbreak, self-doubt and maybe even self-loathing.Prior to Eli and Abel, I wasted at least half of my adult life obsessing about things I had lost \u2013 men who broke my heart, clients who weren\u2019t a good fit, friendships that had faded.My sons taught me to focus on the miracles that are right in front of my eyes every single day, beginning with my 3.7%.Correction: This piece initially stated Lenti is in her fourth decade and has been amended to reflect that she is in her fifth decade."

Watch Honig answer readers\u2019 questions on \u201cCNN Newsroom with Ana Cabrera\u201d on weekends.At the second impeachment trial of former President Donald Trump, there is no real dispute about what actually happened. Trump\u2019sthe legitimacy of the November election, histo the crowd on the Ellipse in Washington, DC, on January 6, and theon the Capitol by many of his most ardent supporters \u2013 they\u2019re all memorialized, on video, for the world to see.Trump\u2019s lawyers can\u2019t change what happened on that day, or before. Instead, they are trying to make the case all about Trump\u2019s subjective intent, which can be less tangible and more difficult to discern. Trump\u2019s lawyers have argued that he did not intend for the attack to occur and, they claim in their, he was \u201chorrified\u201d at what he saw his supporters doing inside the Capitol.But House impeachment managers have one devastating piece of evidence that decisively refutes Trump\u2019s attorneys\u2019 claim about their client\u2019s state of mind:January 6 at around 6 p.m.In the tweet \u2013 sent hours after the Capitol insurrection had occurred andby Twitter \u2013 Trump wrote: \u201cThese are the things and events that happen when a sacred landslide election victory is so unceremoniously & viciously stripped away from great patriots who have been badly & unfairly treated for so long. Go home with love & in peace. Remember this day forever!\u201dAsk yourself: Are those the words of a person who was genuinely \u201chorrified\u201d by what he saw, to quote Trump\u2019s attorneys? To the contrary, in my view, the tweet establishes beyond any real doubt that Trump was pleased at what his supporters had done. He called them \u201cgreat patriots,\u201d and urged them to \u201c(r)emember this day forever!\u201d Those are unequivocal words of empathy with the mob \u2013 even exultation \u2013 not regret.In his tweet, Trump also reiterated the fundamental lie that the election was stolen from him. For months leading up to the January 6 riot, hethis absurd claim. And that lie ultimately fueled the dangerously misguided anger that motivated Trump\u2019s followers to ransack the Capitol. Yet, even in the immediate wake of the attack \u2013 the Capitol badly damaged, members of Congress sent into hiding, lives lost \u2013 Trump continued to promote the same fundamental lie that had sparked the riot in the first place.House managers have rightly seized on Trump\u2019s January 6 tweet as telltale evidence of his intent.  They featured the tweet as a capstone on the compelling,they played to kick off the constitutional argument on the opening day of the impeachment trial. And lead House impeachment manager Rep. Jamie Raskin used the January 6 tweet to powerfully conclude his opening argument in Wednesday\u2019s floor proceedings.In short, the January 6 tweet proves that the Capitol insurrectionists did exactly as Trump hoped and intended. And the tweet came directly from Trump himself. There can be no claim that his words were twisted or distorted. They\u2019re as clear as the letters that Trump typed into his own Twitter feed.Prosecutors yearn for evidence like this. It is simply devastating and almost certainly would ensure a conviction if this case were a criminal trial (though, of course, this impeachment trial is a different procedure altogether, guided more by politics than pure merit). And House impeachment managers have done an effective job thus far featuring Trump\u2019s January 6 tweet as decisive proof of his intent.We\u2019ll soon see whether Trump\u2019s attorneys have any defense to his January 6 tweet. I suspect they won\u2019t, and that they\u2019ll simply ignore it. All things considered, that might be the most prudent course. Because there simply is no credible way to defend against this telling glimpse into Trump\u2019s mind."

        "text": "Editor\u2019s Note:Elie Honig is a CNN legal analyst and former federal and state prosecutor. The views expressed in this commentary are his own. Readon CNN. Watch Honig answer readers\u2019 questions on \u201cCNN Newsroom with Ana Cabrera\u201d on weekends.Just over a week before the start of his second impeachment trial, former President Donald Trump\u2019s entire legal team has. What already promised to be an unpredictable and unprecedented show on the Senate floor just got even messier, as it appears that Trump will insist on repeating the same dangerous lie that sparked the Capitol riot \u2013 that the election was stolen from him \u2013 and led to his (second) impeachment in the first place.Here\u2019s what we know. The mass resignations of all five of Trump\u2019s lawyers show us something has gone terribly wrong on the defense team. And these lawyers were no hacks \u2013 several of them are Justice Department, and the (former) lead attorney, Butch Bowers, was a government ethics. They would not abandon a client this close to trial without darn good reason.Any defense attorney holds a broad obligation to represent his or her client zealously. That\u2019s a crucial part of our adversarial justice system. But there are limits on what a defense attorney can argue. For example,, it would be unethical for any attorney to raise an argument \u201cthat he knows to be false.\u201d The \u201crigged election\u201d narrative certainlythat description.It\u2019s telling that theof the falling-out between Trump and his (former) lawyers was his insistence that they raise the \u201cstolen election\u201d defense. Trump\u2019s defenders certainly could have argued in good faith and within ethical boundaries that it is unconstitutional to hold an impeachment trial for a former president, or that Trump\u2019s actions were protected political speech under the First Amendment. I disagree with both of these arguments on the merits, but Trump and his attorneys certainly would have been within their rights to make these claims before the Senate. But the \u201cstolen election\u201d argument crosses a line.Why the Trump impeachment trial is crucialWhat happens next? I see three possibilities. One, Trump could find a new legal team. Time is absurdly short; typically, even in a routine criminal trial, the legal teams would be in endgame crunch-time mode by now \u2013 never mind for a historic impeachment proceeding. But whoever does take on this representation should understand that, if he actually raises the \u201cstolen election\u201d defense, he does so at his own professional and reputational risk. The \u201cstolen election\u201d liethe Capitol insurrection on January 6 and repeating it now from the well of the Senate only threatens to provoke more unrest.Trump also couldto represent himself. This is extremely unlikely but legally possible. Criminal defendants can and at times do elect to represent themselves \u2013 it\u2019s called \u201cpro se,\u201d in the Latin legalese \u2013 and there\u2019s no technical reason Trump can\u2019t do the same at impeachment. But do not count on this happening.Or Trump could elect not to defend himself at all. There is nothing in the law that requires a person facing impeachment to have any legal representation. Trump could, in essence, choose to sit this one out, and to rely on Republican senators to make the case for him on the floor. Given last week\u2019sby 45 senators to consider a motion on the constitutionality of trying a former president \u2013 which signaled, but did not necessarily lock in, support for Trump by those who voted to hear the motion (more on this below) \u2013 Trump might choose to sit back and hope that at least 34 of those senators vote to acquit. Convicting an impeached official requires a two-thirds vote of the Senate.We are, once again, in uncharted territory with Trump. His stubborn insistence on continuing to promote the dangerous election fraud lie caused the Capitol insurrection has now cost him his legal team. And if he continues to press that lie, it could cost him \u2013 and the country \u2013 even more.Now, your questions:Technically, the Senate can choose to vote in secret, but it almost certainly won\u2019t. The Senate generally makes its own procedures for impeachment by majority vote; however, there is a separate provision of the US Constitution that enables the Senate to hold any vote publicly if so requested by one-fifth of all senators (20 of the 100 senators). It seems virtually certain that, even if the secrecy issue did arise, at least 20 senators would vote to hold the impeachment vote publicly. Count on seeing every senator stand up in the well at the end of trial and declaring his or her verdict, guilty or not guilty.Yes. Last week, Sen. Rand Paul made a motion on the Senate floor to consider his argument that it is unconstitutional to try a former president. (I believe he\u2019s wrong, as I explained here.)Fifty-five senators (all 50 Democrats plus five Republicans) voted to \u201ctable\u201d (essentially, to put off) the motion, while 45 senators (all Republican) voted to hear the motion.A Trump representative has claimed that, \u201cIn fact, 45 senators have already voted that it is unconstitutional.\u201d But that\u2019s wrong. Those 45 senators voted only to hear debate on and consider the motion, but not on its ultimate merits. In fact, at least two of the 45 senators, John Thune and Rob Portman, have publicly stated that their votes to hear Paul\u2019s motion do not mean they will necessarily vote to acquit Trump. To be sure, the vote on Paul\u2019s motion does signal that many and perhaps all of the 45 senators are inclined toward acquitting Trump, but it does not guarantee any such outcome."

Watch Honig answer readers\u2019 questions on \u201cCNN Newsroom with Ana Cabrera\u201d on weekends.In his final full day in office, President Donald Trump refrained from the most outrageous possible abuses of thePerhaps wary of causing political backlash, given his impending Senate impeachment trial, Trump has not pardoned himself, his children or his personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani.But make no mistake: Withof 73 pardons and 70 sentence commutations, Trump offered up one last burst of cronyism and self-dealing. While Trump issued pardons to several recipients whose cases had been rightly advocated by criminal justice reform groups, he also doled out free passes to an unseemly lineup of criminals who apparently have been granted mercy based largely on their personal connections to Trump, their wealth and access or their status as celebrity objects of fascination.This is, needless to say, not how pardons are supposed to work. The best way to understand Trump\u2019s abuse of the pardon power is by comparing his actions to those of his immediate predecessors. President Barack Obama issuedand commutations than Trump has. But the vast majority of Obama\u2019swent to nonviolent drug offenders who had received harsh prison sentences and to whom Obama had no personal or political connections \u2013 whilehave gone largely to his own political and personal allies and other well-connected recipients.Trump's sordid pardons cement his corrupt legacyPresident George W. Bushthat he was taken aback by the last-minute blitz of pardon requests from well-connected individuals during his final days in office. Bush resolved not to grant any such requests but rather to consider only those pardon applications that had been vetted by the Justice Department\u2019s(who traditionally provides nonbinding guidance to the President to ensure that pardons are properly vetted and equitable). In contrast, Trump has largelythe pardon attorney.Here\u2019s a rundown of the most odious of the pardons and commutations that Trump granted in his final hours, in his own version of Pardongate:Bannon brazenlyTrump\u2019s own most ardent followers who donated to a scam called \u201cWe Build the Wall,\u201d federal prosecutors said. Bannonof hundreds of thousands of dollars they\u2019d given to that fund and used the money for his own lavish personal lifestyle. Now, Trump has let Bannon off the hook, while hanging his own most fervent supporters out to dry.The former Republican Party and Trump fundraiserto secretly lobbying the US government on behalf of Chinese and Malaysian interests. The Justice Department previously had declared that Broidy\u2019s conduct \u201cposes a serious threat to our national security and undermines the integrity of our democracy.\u201d  He, too, gets a free pass.Why Trump can't legally pardon himselfThe infamouslyformer mayor of Detroit had his sentence commuted by the President because, according to the White Househe \u201chas taught public speaking classes and has led Bible Study groups with his fellow inmates.\u201d That\u2019s it. That\u2019s the entire rationale.and money laundering as an offshoot of special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019sin the 2016 election, Erickson received a pardon seemingly solely because his case had some connection to Mueller. The White House news release focuses not on Erickson\u2019s conduct (\u201ca minor financial crime,\u201d it said) but solely on the specious and overwrought claim that this \u201cpardon helps right the wrongs of what has been revealed to be perhaps the greatest witch hunt in American History.\u201dThe closest comparison for Trump\u2019s endgame pardon blitz happened on President Bill Clinton\u2019s last day in office in January 2001, when Clintonover 130 pardons to a group that included his personal and political allies, politicaland his own half-brother. Clinton\u2019s actions became known asand prompted a federal(which did not result in charges). We\u2019ll see if Trump\u2019s closing flurry of pardons will bring a similar response.Yes. There is historicalfor impeaching and trying a federal official after he has left office. On March 2, 1876, Secretary of War William Belknap resigned under political pressure. Later that day, the House impeached Belknap. Then, in August 1876, the Senate held Belknap\u2019s impeachment trial (and ultimately acquitted him).Common sense leads to the same result. Article I of thepermits Congress to disqualify an officer from holding future office. What happens, then, if a president commits an egregious act on his last full day in office, January 19? There would not be time to impeach and formally try and convict that president before he leaves office at noon the next day. So, the only practical way to effectuate the Constitution\u2019s disqualification provision is by holding impeachment proceedings after the president has left office.Yes, but the confusion here is understandable.of the Constitution provides that the President \u201cshall have power to grant reprieves and pardons for offenses against the United States, except in cases of impeachment.\u201d  The language here is ambiguous. Read one way, it could appear to say that after the President is impeached by the House, he loses the power to issue pardons. But read another way, it says that the President can issue pardons for criminal offenses but not for impeachment.Theis correct. There is no provision anywhere in the Constitution, statutes or case law that strips a President of any power solely upon impeachment by the House (though, of course, if convicted in the Senate, the President loses the office and all of its powers).It would be anomalous for the President to lose only one power \u2013 the power to pardon \u2013 upon impeachment alone.  Indeed, all three Presidents who have been impeached \u2013,and Trump (the first time) \u2013after their impeachments.Rather, the clause in Article II means that while a President can pardon an official (or any person) for a crime, he cannot pardon an official out of impeachment. In other words, the President does not have power to un-impeach."

The federal district court judge presiding over the case was then largely unknown to the general public, but now may be on the precipice of a nomination to the United States Supreme Court:.As a prosecutor, I appeared before dozens of federal and state judges. I don\u2019t say this lightly: Jackson was as impressive on the bench as any of them, ranking among the absolute finest judges I\u2019ve ever seen in action.On the day of the hearing, Jackson immediately made clear that she was in charge of her courtroom, but she did it without ego or drama. She commanded respect by her presence, by her obvious level of preparation and by the dignified way she treated the parties before her.Some judges struggle to control their courtrooms and the attorneys before them, while others are unnecessarily domineering and arrogant. Jackson naturally found a perfect middle ground, keeping firm control of the proceedings, while also creating an environment of respect and professionalism.Biden's promise to appoint a Black woman as Supreme Court justice updates an old traditionJackson plainly had read and absorbed the parties\u2019 briefs \u2013 candidly, not all judges do that \u2013 and she asked incisive, penetrating questions that challenged the core assertions made by both sides. She understood the facts of the case and the law, perhaps in more depth even than some of the attorneys before her.During the argument and in her, Jackson adhered closely to established precedent, acknowledged the limitations of the judiciary\u2019s power and challenged McGahn\u2019s assertion of absolute executive branch immunity and the basis for the House\u2019s subpoena.Jackson was evenhanded, spending nearly equal amounts of time questioning the parties for each side, and she showed no predisposition or favoritism either way. She was also responsive to the public, acknowledging the media that had gathered in the courtroom and ensuring that we had full access to the hearing \u2013 even allowing for a media overflow room.Ultimately, Jackson issued a thorough \u2013 exhaustive, even \u2013. Her decision was deeply researched, impeccably written and incisive. In deciding in favor of the House and ordering enforcement of the McGahn subpoena, over the executive privilege claims of then-President Donald Trump, Jackson memorably wrote, \u201cStated simply, the primary takeaway from the past 250 years of recorded American history is that Presidents are not kings.\u201d Higher courts, including the US Supreme Court,Trump\u2019s overbroad invocations of executive privilege.About a year and a half later, in June 2021, Jacksonas a judge on the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. President Joe Biden, apparently recognizing Jackson\u2019s unique talents, had nominated her to the nation\u2019s most prestigious intermediate court of appeals, which is often regarded as the nation\u2019s second-most-powerful court (after the US Supreme Court, of course). The Senate confirmed Judge Jackson by a 53-44 vote, with three Republicans \u2013 Sens. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Susan Collins of Maine \u2013 supporting her confirmation.It is too early to tell if Biden will nominate Jackson or any of the\u2013 including California Supreme Court Justice Leondra Kruger and South Carolina US District Judge J. Michelle Childs. However, if Biden does nominate Jackson for the Supreme Court, it\u2019ll be tough for those three Republican senators to reverse course and oppose her nomination. And it would be a mistake to do so, whatever the politics, because Jackson, based on my observation of her in this case and, has proved herself to be a truly exceptional federal judge."

Watch the full-length video above, and watch for more from Honig on this project on CNN and CNN International. The views expressed in this commentary are his own. Viewon CNN.Sixty years ago, the world saw the face of evil.Sixty years ago, in an internationally broadcast trial, millions of people around the world watched as a man \u2013 a monster, really, despite his human form and slight frame \u2013 sat in a courtroom in the newly-formed nation of Israel.The defendant: the notorious Nazi Adolf Eichmann,as the \u201cArchitect of the Holocaust,\u201d stood charged with unimaginable crimes against humanity \u2013 the murder of millions. Eichmann\u2019s dry, technical title \u2013 translated roughly as the chief Nazi \u201clogistics coordinator\u201d \u2013 conveyed his mechanical approach to his work but belied the horror of it all. The \u201clogistics\u201d which Eichmann \u201ccoordinated\u201d were the systematic rounding up and deportation of millions of Jews and others to their deaths in Nazi concentration camps.American forcesEichmann at the end of World War II, but hefrom a prison camp in 1946. He remained in hiding while an international manhunt ensued. Years after Eichmann\u2019s escape, Israeli intelligence agents dramatically abducted andhim in Argentina in 1960 (as depicted in several books and movies, including \u201cThe House on Garibaldi Street\u201d in 1975 and \u201cOperation Finale\u201d in 2018). Israeli forces smuggled Eichmann out of Argentina and transported him to Jerusalem for trial.The trialin April 1961. For several months, the world watched on television as Israeli prosecutors and investigators methodically laid out the proof of Eichmann\u2019s crimes. During the trial, Eichmanninside a bulletproof glass box, an iconic image of a power-mad, genocidal mastermind forced to confront his own wicked actions.At the end of the trial, a three-judge panel found Eichmannof war crimes, crimes against humanity, and other offenses, and sentenced him to death. He appealed to the Israeli Supreme Court, which upheld the verdict and sentence. Eichmannby hanging on June 1, 1962.While the Eichmann trial is now firmly part of world history, the lessons still resonate today. Hatred based on race, religion, sex, sexual orientation and ethnicity sadly remains ain the United States and elsewhere. We need to remember the Eichmann trial for what it can teach us about our collective past \u2013 and future.Two of the men who tried Eichmann survive today: prosecutorand investigator. Both men live in Israel, in their mid-90s, surrounded by warm, loving families. Sixty years after the Eichmann trial, they spoke with me about their roles in one of the monumental criminal cases in world history.Bach, now 94,a childhood spent repeatedly fleeing just ahead of the Nazis. He attended the 1936 Olympics in Berlin, and sat close enough to Adolf Hitler to see him turn away in disgust when American sprinter Jesse Owens won the gold medal. Bach\u2019s family left Germany for the Netherlands in 1938, just weeks before\u2013 the infamous night when Nazis killed dozens of German Jews, arrested some 30,000 Jewish men, destroyed thousands of Jewish businesses and burned or otherwise damaged more than 1,000 synagogues.His family fled the Netherlands one month before the Nazisin 1940. Bach, then a young teenager, and his family settled in the territory that would later become Israel. He was bar mitzvahed during that trip, while on board the ship\u2013 which, on its next journey, was sunk by a bomb, claiming the lives of more than 250 people. As Bach put it, he and his family were \u201calways sort of just one step ahead.\u201dBacha lawyer in Israel, and he was tapped to serve as one of the three prosecutors responsible for trying Eichmann on the worldwide stage.  (Bach later would go on to serve as a justice on the Israeli Supreme Court). Despite the passage of time, Bach\u2019s memories of the trial remain clear. He vividly recalls the testimony of one survivor, Martin Foldi, whoin a cattle car from Hungary to Auschwitz in 1944 with his wife, son, and daughter. Upon arrival, a Nazi guard signaled for Foldi to go right and instructed his wife, son and daughter to go left.When Foldi looked up just after being separated from his family, he could no longer see his wife or son in the distance as they moved ahead in their line. But, Bach recalls, Foldi testified he had recently bought a bright red coat for his daughter, who was then two and a half years old. Foldi saw \u201cthat little red dot getting smaller and smaller \u2013 this is how my family disappeared from my life.\u201dIn a trial filled with testimony about unimaginable horrors, Bach said the testimony about the red coat was the \u201conly minute of the trial \u2026 I suddenly couldn\u2019t utter a sound.\u201d Keenly aware that the judges were waiting for him to continue, he pretended to shuffle papers on his desk to buy himself a moment to gain his composure.Bach rejects efforts to soften the reality around the horrific crimes committed by Eichmann. Eichmann and his court-appointed attorney maintained during the trial that he was just following his superiors\u2019 orders. Hannah Arendt, who covered the trial for The New Yorker, famously wrote in her book \u201cEichmann in Jerusalem\u201d that Eichmann embodied the \u201cbanality of evil.\u201d Arendt argued, \u201cEichmann was not Iago and not Macbeth \u2026 Except for an extraordinary diligence in looking out for his personal advancement, he had no motives at all \u2026 He merely, to put the matter colloquially, never realized what he was doing.\u201dBach flatly calls Arendt\u2019s conclusion \u201crubbish.\u201d Displaying the methodical care of a skilled prosecutor, Bach explains that after the Holocaust (but before his trial), Eichmann said that henot having done more to kill Jews. He cites numerous examples where Eichmann took affirmative steps to prevent any Jewish person from being spared or shown mercy.Bach proudly notes that, despite the intense emotion and publicity surrounding the case, Eichmann was tried in accordance with rule of law and principles of fairness. With his vast experience as prosecutor, defense attorney and judge during his career, he recalls with pride that \u201cwe wanted to handle this case like we handled any other case.\u201d Bach understood that, with history on the line, \u201cit was important for history\u2019s sake that every point of legal decency had to be followed.\u201dUnlike Bach, Goldmann-Gilead was unable to escape the Nazis as they expanded their control over Europe in the 1930s and 1940s. When Goldmann-Gilead was a teenager in 1942, his mother and sister were \u201cdeported\u201d by the Nazis on a railcar to the Belzec extermination camp. He never saw them again.Goldmann-Gilead lived through the ultimate of horrors. As a teenager, hetrying to hide books about railroad construction to keep them from falling into Nazi hands. A SS officer then called Goldmann-Gilead out to a public square in view of his friends and neighbors, and lashed him over 80 times. Goldmann-Gilead himself passed out during the brutal beating; he only learned the number of lashes later from his friends who stood by, horrified, counting.Goldmann-Gileadmultiple concentration camps, including the most notorious one of all, Auschwitz. The Nazis branded Goldmann-Gilead\u2019s forearm with his prisoner number: 161135. He still bears his tattoo today, with a sort of defiant pride. In an iconic image, Goldmann-Gilead is seen, years later, sitting at the prosecution table during the Eichmann trial, with his shirt-sleeve rolled up to reveal a muscular forearm bearing the tattoo branded on him by the Nazis years before.Sixty years after the trial, Goldmann-Gilead told me he vividly recalls his face-to-face interrogation of the Nazi\u2019s chief architect of death and destruction. \u201cWhen he opened his mouth \u2013 I cannot forget this \u2013 when he opened his mouth, I saw the doors of the crematorium open,\u201d Goldmann-Gilead says.At one point during the trial, the prosecution team was struggling to authenticate a document that appeared to reflect the transport of Jewish prisoners to the Nazi extermination camps. Goldmann-Gilead realized that his own prisoner number, permanently branded on his arm, was among the numbers listed.After the Israeli court found Eichmann guilty and sentenced him to death, Goldmann-Gilead was one of the few people chosen to witness Eichmann\u2019s execution. Eichmann\u2019s body was cremated, and the ashes were given to Goldmann-Gilead, who was instructed to scatter them at sea. Goldmann-Gilead told me he recalls noticing just how small the quantity of ashes were from one person, compared to the mountain of human ashes he was forced to shovel, many years before, from outside the crematorium at the Birkenau concentration camp.Goldmann-Gilead and a few others boarded a boat in the Mediterranean Sea. He then took the container with Eichmann\u2019s ashes and poured them out. Goldmann-Gilead recalled that afterward he \u201cstood quietly at the edge of the boat and I thought quietly to myself about my parents, my family, and those who did not have the privilege to see one of the greatest murderers brought to justice.\u201dMy grandfather, Lazar Nuchem Honig, was a Polish Jew born in 1911. (I am named after him; my full name, Eliezer, is a variation on his first name). Lazar survived the Holocaust, in part because he was the right age (he was old enough to be put to work but young enough to endure), because he was useful (he was a furrier who could make warm hats the Nazis valued), and because of pure happenstance. Allied forces liberated him from the Sachsenhausen concentration camp in 1945. My family still has a makeshift refugee passport of sorts that he was issued after the war. Across the front, just over his photograph, is a stamp that reads \u201cLiberated by Allies.\u201dLike so many Jews who survived the Holocaust, my grandfather had nothing to go back to. Most of his family had been murdered, he had no home or formal education, and he found himself a refugee in Europe. He eventually emigrated to Sweden, where he met my grandmother, Gusta Zagorski.  She, too, had survived the concentration camps and she, too, had lost nearly her entire family to the Nazi genocide. Toward the end of the war, she survived the infamous \u201cDeath March\u201d to the interior of Germany, and she was liberated from Bergen-Belsen, another notorious Nazi concentration camp.My grandfather died in 1960 from cancer. I never met him, and even my father, who was 10 years old at the time, has mostly fleeting memories. But my grandmother lived until 2008, and I knew her well. (She would have turned 100 just this past June). She was fiery, brilliant, stubborn, blunt, funny, difficult and deeply traumatized.Many Holocaust survivors have spoken or written poignantly of their experiences. That was not my grandmother\u2019s way. She never brought it up. The few times my brothers or I would try to get her to talk about it, she\u2019d respond with a wave of the hand and a dismissive remark along the lines of, \u201cI lived through it once; why would I do it again?\u201dShe had a large group photograph of herself with her extended family taken when she was about 12 or 13 years old in Poland.  I once asked her to tell me what happened to the people in the photograph. She started by saying \u201cMost of them, killed.\u201d She then pointed to specific people pictured: \u201cThis one, dead. This one, dead. I don\u2019t know what happened with this one. That one, killed.\u201dLike I said: she was blunt. Once, I spent an entire summer day driving her from her home in South Jersey to my grandfather\u2019s gravesite, about four hours roundtrip. Again, I tried to pry into her memories of the Holocaust. All she said was that it all felt like a nightmare, she didn\u2019t want to re-live it, but she remembered being liberated at the end by people wearing red crosses on their jackets.My grandparents had two sons, nine grandchildren (including my two brothers and me), and seven great-grandchildren (so far). My grandmother knew her grandchildren well, and she met one of those great grandchildren, my son, several times. I remember her doting on him, stroking his chubby arm and hovering over him to protect him.Just days before my grandmother passed away, when we all knew what was coming, she met another great-grandchild, my daughter, who was a baby at the time. My grandmother had almost no strength left, and she could barely open her eyes \u2013 but she managed to force herself awake to take in her first great-granddaughter. I believe my grandmother passed on a piece of her fiery spirit to my daughter in those final few moments.Bach and Goldmann-Gilead understood in 1961 that they carried a massive, perhaps impossible, responsibility: to serve justice on one of history\u2019s most treacherous mass murderers. In the six decades since, the legacy of the Eichmann trial, and the work of Bach and Goldmann-Gilead and many others who have since passed on, has only grown. The images of the trial are indelible: Eichmann in the glass box, Goldmann-Gilead quietly but defiantly displaying the Auschwitz prisoner number tattoo on his forearm, Bach\u2019s examination of the man who last saw his daughter as a shrinking spot of red on the horizon.Bach and Goldmann-Gilead were, in a sense, just doing their jobs, in the noblest tradition of any prosecutor or law enforcement agent. Their day-to-day courtroom work reminds me in many respects of the work I did as a prosecutor, many decades later: debriefing witnesses, preparing documents, arguing evidentiary points in court, delivering opening and closing arguments.But Bach and Goldmann-Gilead also knew, six decades ago, that they were fighting for justice for millions of people. Some of those people, just a miniscule fraction, were my own family members \u2013 my grandparents who miraculously survived, and many other family members who didn\u2019t.The lessons from the Eichmann trial resonate today. In 2015, a racist shooternine black worshippers in a church in Charleston, South Carolina. In 2017, White supremacists\u201cJews will not replace us\u201d and invoked racist symbols and slogans in Charlottesville. In 2018, a gunman11 Jewish worshippers inside the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh. At the January 6 Capitol insurrection, riotersneo-Nazi gear, including a shirtwith \u201cCamp Auschwitz.\u201d In the last few months, a member of Congress hasnonsensical, ignorant public remarks that trivialize and mischaracterize the true horror of the Holocaust. And, just last week, barracks at Auschwitzwith anti-Semitic graffiti and Holocaust-denying slogans.Goldmann-Gilead told me, \u201cWith the death of Eichmann, the murderous ideology of nationalist socialism was not scattered.  It is still existing \u2026 in the form of hatred, hatred that is dangerous. And we must be on guard so that catastrophes do not repeat themselves.\u201dGoldmann-Gilead is a living reminder that, in his own words, \u201cWe must educate the new generation not to hate, and to avoid such hatred. Otherwise, our struggle against such evil will be in vain.\u201d"

Watch Honig answer readers\u2019 questions on \u201cCNN Newsroom with Jim Acosta\u201d on weekends.The two-pagefrom John Eastman, disclosed in the new book by Bob Woodward and Robert Costa, begins with a lie and then descends into madness.Eastman is a lawyer who worked with former president Donald Trump\u2019s legal team to overthrow democracy and try to steal the 2020 election.First, the lie: \u201c7 states have transmitted dual slates of Electors to the President of the Senate.\u201d What seven states? What \u201cdual slates of electors\u201d? How were they purportedly \u201ctransmitted\u201d to the Senate? This is all, of course, nonsense. In fact,certified one, and only one, slate of presidential electors based on the 2020 election results.The Eastman memo proceeds from this foundational lie to build a wild legal fantasy on top of it; in that respect, the memo is a perfect encapsulation of Trump\u2019s overarching strategy to steal the 2020 election. Eastman casually adopts as true a bold legal fiction that \u201c[t]here is very solid legal authority, and historical precedent, for the view that the President of the Senate does the counting, including the resolution of disputed electoral votes \u2026 and all the Members of Congress can do is watch.\u201d That\u2019s simplyas a matter of law and history. Thankfully, the President of the Senate, who was then-Vice President Mike Pence, recognized this, andto unilaterally override the votes cast by the disputed states.Eastman proceeds to lay out a strategy that is purposefully deceptive. He suggests Pence should announce the results in the states alphabetically, but should \u201cdefer decision\u201d on Arizona and the other six states that Trump is trying to steal until the very end of the count.At that point, Eastman suggests, Pence should reject the vote counts from those seven states. Then, according to Eastman, comes the dramatic climax: \u201cPence then gavels Trump as re-elected.\u201dThis suggestion is as wrong-headed as it is audacious. No person \u2013 not the vice president or anybody else \u2013 has the power to \u201cgavel\u201d anybody as the president of the United States. That\u2019s the stuff of dictatorship. Then again, that seems to be precisely what Eastman aims for in his memo.Eastman dismissively predicts \u201c[h]owls, of course, from Democrats\u2026\u201d He\u2019s only partially correct here; no doubt, there would have been \u201chowls\u201d but likely from many conscientious Republicans and Democrats alike. Republican members of Congress, including Senators Mike Lee and Lindsey Graham \u2013 both reliable Trump loyalists \u2013 rightlyand rejected Eastman\u2019s proposed plan and other variations of it, according to Woodward and Costa, authors of \u201cPeril.\u201dEastman closes the memo by noting that his plan should be enacted by Vice President Pence but, \u201cPence should do this without asking for permission \u2013 either from a vote of a joint session or from the Court.\u201d That\u2019s a sure sign Eastman knows his scheme is outrageous and illegal. He proposes simply to ram it through and make the other side fight, after the fact, to undo the damage.Eastman nowthat his memo merely \u201cexplored all options that had been proposed.\u201d But that\u2019s revisionism. In the memo, Eastman doesn\u2019t merely \u201cexplore\u201d or ruminate on theoretical or academic possibilities. He specifically argues that Pence \u201cshould\u201d carry out the plan, as proposed, and he offers strategic advice on how to spring the scheme as a trap on unsuspecting members of Congress (by holding the seven states until last and by springing the plot first \u201cwithout asking for permission\u201d).is, somehow, both a lawyer and a senior fellow at a research institute. He\u2019s also a disgrace to the profession. His memo is at once rife with falsehoods, childlike in its reasoning and deadly dangerous in its proposed application.Eastman needs to face consequences. State licensing authorities should review his fitness to practice law. Congress needs to demand answers, issuing a subpoena to compel Eastman to testify if necessary. And the Justice Department must, at a minimum, open a criminalto determine whether Eastman\u2019s proposed actions constituted conspiracy to violate federal election laws.If nobody takes action, then Eastman will fade into memory as just another unhinged conspiracy theorist who proposed dangerous abuses of power to serve Trump\u2019s whims, and then walked away unscathed.Now, your questions:(North Carolina): Regarding Roe v. Wade, doesn\u2019t established federal law from the Supreme Court supersede any conflicting state law?That\u2019s exactly how things are supposed to work. However, the Supreme Court earlier this monthto issue an emergency stay (a pause, essentially) on a Texas state law known as \u201cSB-8,\u201d which makes it virtually impossible for a woman to get an abortion in Texas \u2013 squarely contradictory to Roe v. Wade.The five-justice majority noted that, while they expressed no view on the constitutionality of the Texas law, they would not issue a stay because the law posed complex procedural issues that could pose an obstacle to future legal challenges.The Justice Department has now filed a direct legalto the Texas law,that it operates in \u201copen defiance\u201d of Roe v. Wade. While the Texas case winds through the federal courts over the coming months, however, keep an eye on a different restrictive state law, out of Mississippi. The Supreme Court willand rule on this case in the upcoming term, with oral argument set for December and a decision likely in the spring or summer of 2022. The Mississippi case has been positioned by advocates as a direct challenge to Roe v. Wade, and could give the court an opportunity to overrule its own longstanding precedent.(Indiana): How much jeopardy is DACA in, given that it was created by executive action and not by Congressional legislation?Once again, the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, adopted through executive action by then-President Barack Obama in 2012 to provide a temporary reprieve from deportation for \u201cDreamers\u201d who arrived in the United States as children, is in legal jeopardy. Last year, the US Supreme Courtthe Trump administration\u2019s attempt to rescind DACA, ruling that the administration had not followed proper administrative procedures. However, a federal judge has sincethat DACA is unconstitutional on the merits because it was enacted by presidential decree, without Congressional authorization. The Biden administration hasthat ruling to the federal Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals. That court\u2019s ruling likely will settle the issue, unless the Supreme Court decides to take the case and rule on the merits once and for all."

        "text": "Editor\u2019s Note:SE Cupp is a CNN political commentator and the host of \u201c.\u201d The views expressed in this commentary are solely hers. Viewarticles on CNN.In an NBC/WSJ poll earlier this year, onlyagreed that the two-party system in this country was working fairly well.This means that both parties are leaving a lot to be desired, according to voters, and many are coming to see the radical need for an alternative. In fact, 38% of respondents said the country needs a third party, the highest number who have said so since this poll began tracking the question in 1995.And a third party that makes it its raison d\u2019etre to represent the rest of the electorate might get a good look by voters in this environment.Contributing to the need for an alternative party is the feeling that politics is dividing us up \u2013 and leaving a lot of us out. And the choices we\u2019re usually left with, Republican or Democrat, aren\u2019t good enough.Just take this example from one of the early Democratic primary debates in June, when candidates were asked whether they supported decriminalizing our borders \u2013that is, repealingof the US Code, which makes crossing the border without official inspection a misdemeanor offense.shot up.As of anby Politico, 14 Democratic candidates, some of whom are no longer in the running, had supported decriminalizing the border. For many progressive voters, the idea likely seemed necessary. After all, President Donald Trump was using the statute to detain and separate asylum-seeking families at the border.Dem Rep. Alexandria Ocasio Cortez: \u201cBorder policy: As @JulianCastro mentioned in the #DemDebate, it\u2019s time to repeal Section 1325 & 1326, the statutes this admin is using to mindlessly throw people in cages. We have to take these proceedings out of criminal code and into civil code. Torture accomplishes nothing.\u201dTrump is doing all the wrong things on immigrationWhat made the moment astonishing for anyone remotely in touch with voters \u2013 or who had read recent polls \u2013 was that this idea was far outside the mainstream. What many saw as simply ending the mechanism to determine whether immigration was legal or illegal is not popular.According to anamong registered voters conducted shortly after that debate, decriminalizing the border enjoyed a paltry 27% of support.But this was a Democratic primary \u2013 the candidates were at least speaking to their base, right?No. Only 45% of Democrats thought decriminalizing the border a good idea, versus 47% who didn\u2019t. When broken down even further, only 34% of moderate Democrats supported it, while 58% did not. And those coveted independent voters? Only 24% of them were on board.Here was a policy proposal supported wholly by at least 14 Democratic candidates for president, and in some part by others, that had been resoundingly rejected by the majority of America, and also the majority of their own voters.What was going on here? What were Democrats thinking?This is emblematic of our new politics of extremes. In recent years, ultra-progressive voices on the left and only the Trumpiest of positions on the right seem to be winning out, while more moderate voices in both parties are going extinct.On the right, just look at the fates of Jeff Flake, an Arizona Republican Senator forced into early retirement for his pushback against Trump, or Charlie Dent, a Pennsylvania Republican congressman whose centrist views within his party prompted him to resign before finishing his term, leaving his seat vacant. (Dent is now a CNN political commentator). And thegrow almost by the day.Over on the left, there is some unity in common cause against Trump, but Democrats are also eating their own. Ocasio-Cortez pushed her Queens predecessor, former Rep. Joe Crowley, out after 20 years in that seat. Voices like those in \u201cthe Squad\u201d \u2013 Ocasio-Cortez, Rep. Ilhan Omar, Rep. Rashida Tlaib and Rep. Ayanna Pressley \u2013 get far more attention than their moderate counterparts.A so-called \u201c,\u201d a group of moderate Democratic congresswomen including Rep. Abigail Spanberger, Rep. Mikie Sherrill, Rep. Elissa Slotkin and Rep. Chrissy Houlahan, has far less recognizable names. Unlike Ocasio-Cortez, none, for example, has been on \u201cJimmy Kimmel Live!\u201dThe mythical independent voter isn't going to save usMeanwhile, as Democrats and Republicans swing for the extremes, millions and millions of Americans are left without real representation. The 2020 primary is elucidating that. A line I\u2019ve heard over and over again from moderates and independents after a Democratic debate is something to the effect of, \u201cWell I can\u2019t vote for Trump, but I\u2019m not with those guys, either.\u201dIn preferring to quadruple down on their most ardent base supporters, the parties are missing a wide swath of voters in the middle who are turned off by both the style and the substance of their increasingly absolutist proposals and their insistence that \u201cfinding common ground\u201d is for wimps and traitors. (Just ask Democratic presidential contender Joe Biden how well it went over whenVice President Mike Pence \u201ca decent guy.\u201d)Despite the rancor and fire-breathing on both sides, most voters are somewhere in the middle on any host of issues, even the most \u201cdivisive.\u201dTake abortion. \u201c[M]ore than half of US adults take a non-absolutist position,\u201d. Only 12% of voters say abortion should be illegal in all cases, and 27% say it should be legal in all cases. The rest of us \u2013 the majority \u2013 agree it should be legal but with restrictions.Gun control is another issue in which the majority often goes unrepresented.A number of gun control proposalswide bipartisan support, even among Republican voters. Polls show 72% support requiring background checks for private gun sales. And yet, the majority of Republican lawmakers refuse to even consider that widely popular measure. Shouldn\u2019t those voters feel betrayed by that?Immigration, though, perhaps best encapsulates the political parties\u2019 willingness to ignore majority opinions, even inside their own parties.While Democrats are clear on wanting a pathway to citizenship for Dreamers and other undocumented immigrants, and Republicans frequently say that, what neither seem to get is where they share common ground.Americans exaggerate the extremism of the other sideBelieve it or not, a(54%) believe there should be a way for undocumented immigrants to stay in this country legally \u2013 a path to legal status \u2013 if they meet some requirements over time.And as it turns out, that\u2019s what undocumented immigrants seem to prioritize as well. If we\u2019re to believe thefollowing former President Ronald Reagan\u2019s 1986 amnesty bill, by 2009 only about 41% of those legalized had become American citizens. More than citizenship, many immigrants want to be able to come out of the shadows and work here legally.So why are we arguing over citizenship instead of passing legal-status legislation, which enjoys majority support and even Republican support?Here\u2019s the easy answer to that and other head-scratching questions about who is actually representing us: Solving problems isn\u2019t as politically profitable as keeping them broken.Whether on immigration or gun crime, health care or climate, the two parties thrive when these issues remain broken. Democrats can fundraise off and run against xenophobic, gun-crazy, poor-hating, gas-guzzling Republicans, and Republicans do the same against open-border, gun-banning, wealth-redistributing, coal-killing Democrats.Meanwhile, a majority of voters are left hanging with unsolved problems, somewhere in the middle of this never-ending scrum.Avlon: Our polarized Congress can't address problemsAs much as it seems like Republican voters just want to \u201cown the Libs,\u201d and Democratic voters are happy being \u201cthe resistance,\u201d it might surprise you to know that there are plenty who actually want cooperation between the parties.Just after the 2018 midterm elections, in which Democrats took back the House, a full 46% of Democratic voters said they thought Democratic leaders in Congressa great deal or a fair amount with Trump over the next two years.Even more astonishingly, 77% of Republicans said Trump should cooperate with Democratic leaders in Congress.All of which is to say that neither party seems all that concerned with where voters in the middle are on policy or tone. That\u2019s likely only going to get worse.A third party could fill this void. This party wouldn\u2019t be ideological in nature, as those already exist. It wouldn\u2019t take this position or that one, and it wouldn\u2019t have a charter or a platform committing to a fixed value set. Its only commitment would be to represent and support the majority of moderates and independents on every issue, wherever they are.For example, right now independents represent 38% of the electorate, including those who say they lean Democrat or lean Republican \u2013 a.k.a. moderates., a third party representing these voters right now would support gay marriage and legalizing marijuana, it would oppose building a wall along the US-Mexico border and oppose increasing tariffs between the US and trading partners, and it believes that some government regulation is necessary to protect public interest and that a smaller government providing fewer services is best.That third partypro-abortion \u2013 keeping Roe v. Wade in place \u2013 but would add some restrictions as to when and under what circumstances abortions should be given.Itstricter gun laws, background checks on all gun purchases and a ban on assault weapons. It doesn\u2019t, however, support a mandatory assault weapon buy back, and it believes mental illness is a bigger cause of mass shootings than the availability of guns.Itraising taxes on companies that burn fossil fuels and believes human activity is causing the climate to change.In other words, it would represent the unaffiliated middle that isn\u2019t on either extreme. There wouldn\u2019t be any litmus or purity tests. It would support and run candidates who pledge to represent the middle, and not chase either party as they move further and further to the fringes. The party wouldn\u2019t have to contort itself to defend its leadership, because it would be driven by voters themselves.One of the benefits of this sort of party is that it can\u2019t, by definition, attract demagogues, cult figures or egomaniacs. Campaigns are framed around voter polling, not personality or promises of pie-in-the-sky change that only a few are demanding. The only promise is to listen to you and legislate accordingly.Naturally, the biggest hurdle to a viable third party is the parties themselves. Both hold enormous influence over the presidential elections, from managing donor lists to unleashing get-out-the-vote apparatus.There\u2019s also the debates. Since thewas formed, both parties have fought to keep third-party interlopers out of the televised events. Ross Perot only won his place on the 1992 debate stage because both George H.W. Bush and Bill Clintonhe be allowed to participate, both thinking they would benefit.So long as the parties control the means of production, so to speak, third-party candidates will be seriously disadvantaged.Finally, whether an alternative party in today\u2019s age of personality politics is realistic is a question for another essay. But just imagining a third party that isn\u2019t swayed by cable news hosts, preening politicians, special interests, that isn\u2019t designed solely to enrich coffers and play to an ever-shrinking base, but exists simply to reflect the moderate majority lowers one\u2019s blood pressure almost instantly.Because let\u2019s face it: the two-party system, in all its absolutisms, is leaving many of us without representation. And if America\u2019s future is in the hands of these two parties alone for much longer, we\u2019ll all be politically homeless eventually."

        "text": "Editor\u2019s Note:Julia Song is a Brazilian-American political activist and commentator, who has been featured on OANN, Rebel Media and elsewhere. Follow her on Twitter. The views expressed in this commentary are her own. View moreon CNN.I am a political activist by nature. In my home country of Brazil, I helped organize peacefulagainst government corruption and abuses of power. At the time \u2013 way back in 2013 \u2013 Brazil was, with much of the population living. And yet the country\u2019s politicians, the source of so much of the scandal, continued to push agendas that benefited themselves and few others.But withon the World Cup draining the country\u2019s already depleted resources, I was able to find a path forward with Brazilians from across the political spectrum. Our collective protests helped lead to a government investigation into corruption. Ultimately, many politicians, and the country\u2019s president \u2013 Dilma Rousseff \u2013.Shortly after the protests, I moved to the United States on a family visa, where I was granted temporary residency, allowing me the right to work. I then began a four-year-long process to gain full citizenship, navigating the complexities and the financial costs of the American immigration bureaucracy.Arriving to this new country, I thought that my activism days were behind me. But then I noticed a growing political divide between the elites, or establishment politicians, and working-class Americans just trying to get by. Sensing the disconnect \u2013 and the growing power of the political elite \u2013 I began using the power of social media to raise awareness of the issue, first on Instagram, and then on Twitter.I advocated for my belief in a smaller government that guarantees more individual freedoms \u2013 and allows everyday Americans a chance at success. If you haven\u2019t guessed yet, I\u2019m a Republican, and I support President Donald Trump\u2019s emphasis on fighting for ordinary Americans.Voting for Trump cost me my friendsIt was this reemergence in politics \u2013 and the divisive rhetoric that often animates it \u2013 that motivated me to partake in a Living Room Conversation\u2019s session on immigration. I did so at the invitation of Sue Googe, a fellow Republican and former candidate for North Carolina\u2019s 4th District.Seeing how politically divided America had become \u2013 and fearful of its resemblance to parts of Brazil \u2013 I knew I had been given a rare opportunity. While Sue and I took a conservative approach to immigration, emphasizing the need to preserve our American values and rule of law, three Democrats argued a more liberal position. One, in particular, stood out to me \u2013 Rremida Shkoza, an Albanian refugee to the United States.Rremida, like Sue, had grown up under a communist regime. While Rremida\u2019s family fled Albania, Sue had fled China \u2013 but both shared a deep fear and suspicion of communist rule. I, who had experienced Brazilian socialism \u2013 which bore eerie similarities to communism with its emphasis on dangerously large government \u2013 was also skeptical, having experienced a government descent into corruption.Tribalism isn't the real reason America is dividedBut while Sue and I felt that Democratic socialism \u2013 and its liberalism on open borders and expanded government \u2013 was a threat to American democracy, Rremida seemed to think it was the solution to many of our problems. Having fled a dictatorship, Rremida felt that the United States had an obligation to keep its doors open to any and all asylum seekers. And while she acknowledged all people entering the United States should be vetted, she believed the government, in an expanded form, could accommodate those in need of refuge and freedom.While I disagreed with her approach, I, too, see the humanitarian issue with refugees seeking asylum. And I lamented the fact that Republicans, while feeling for refugees, fail to clearly express that sentiment publicly.But, unlike Rremida, I know the cost of illegal immigration on the system. As I attempt to navigate the legal system with my family, I bear the heavy weight of having to divide preciouswho did not come here through legal means. In Brazil, my mother and brother both depend on each other for income, and while I would love to bring them here to escape the violence, it is almost impossible to bring one without the other. But to bring them here together \u2013 following all federal guidelines \u2013 could take years, as American courts battle.This is why I told Rremida and her fellow Democrats that the solution to immigration begins by improving the legal system \u2013 and channeling the necessary resources to continue to bring the brightest minds across the globe to the US. But it also means cracking down on illegal immigration, building a wall if needed, to dissuade people from coming via that route and jamming up the judicial system with their immigration claims.Rremida, though not entirely agreeing, seemed to understand how my family\u2019s experience was impacting my view of the system. While she may not have endorsed building a wall, she agreed that the distribution of resources on immigration was problematic.Still, despite our differences, I felt she and I shared a common set of values \u2013 compassion, patriotism and a belief that our shared country could be a better version of itself. We may disagree on how to accomplish this \u2013 through a border wall or increased refugee intake, for example \u2013 and we may even disagree on the priorities of the federal government, but we agreed that illegal immigration is a challenge, and comprehensive immigration reform is vital to solving that problem.To know a Democrat also cares about the issue of immigration, but may have a different approach to reforming the system, helps me make peace with our policy differences. Instead of being a faceless liberal, Rremida is now a fellow American with a unique set of experiences that color the way she sees the world \u2013 and the role she thinks America should play in it. And our ability to meet in the same living room, to get out of our red vs. blue silos, gives me a tremendous amount of hope.Among the biggest takeaways, I learned that much of the ground work for bridging political divides starts in homes across America. It starts at the community level, where Americans who are already united by ties to a specific place can come together and hash out their differences."

        "text": "Editor\u2019s Note:John Avlon is a CNN senior political analyst. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. View morearticles on CNN.America is self-segregating into separate political realities. And partisan media is driving much of this division across new platforms, polarizing for profit while amplifying extreme voices and achieving unprecedented reach \u2013 including the Oval Office.President Donald Trump is a creature of partisan media, having kicked off his political career with regular appearances on Fox News. His obsessive consumption causes him to, often overriding information from US intelligence agencies. This leaves him susceptible to conspiracy theories that have now led to the fourth impeachment inquiry in our history.We\u2019ve always had partisan media in America, with Alexander Hamilton and Thomas Jeffersonin the pages of competing broadsheets on the same street in Philadelphia.What we\u2019re dealing with today is different because of the pervasive scale of partisan media and its dissemination alongside disinformation. Itshas been hastened by the rise of a partisan economy amid a fragmented media market, aiming to keep a narrow but intense niche audience addicted to anger, anxiety and resentment. But this is a Faustian bargain, because it requires going to ever-increasing extremes to keep the audience engaged while constantly attacking the credibility of nonpartisan news organizations.The rise of social media, amplifying the loudest voices, often manipulating perceptions of public opinion via anonymous bots and trolls, while driving many reasonable people from the public square of civic debate. These disinformation deployments often shape the tone of partisan media while exploiting the lack of trust it has helped create.The result is real:shows that 73% of Americans now believe that Republicans and Democrats cannot agree on basic facts. That\u2019s a potential death sentence for a democracy that depends on reasoning together to solve common problems.This is also an unhealthy departure from our best traditions. We had partisan newspapers in the past that, for example, excoriated and defended the New Deal, but there was still a general baseline commitment to facts and a clear delineation between news and editorial opinion. On the broadcast side, the fairness doctrine, introduced in 1949, was a condition of leasing federal airwaves that aimed to ensure balance by requiring time for opposing political views.That doesn\u2019t mean there were not deep disagreements and bitter debate.America was tested by the rise of Sen. Joe McCarthy of Wisconsin, a conservative, populist anti-communist with a demagogue\u2019s disregard for facts. While accusing Democrats of treason, McCarthy often tried to, equating The Washington Post with the communist Daily Worker \u2013 while in fact old-line Republican papers like the Chicago Tribune and New York Herald Tribune were also warning about McCarthy\u2019s tactics.McCarthy\u2019s rise on the back of wild accusations caused some editors to question whether the traditional approach of simply reporting what a public official said was consistent with the larger responsibility of telling the truth. But McCarthy met his match in Edward R. Murrow, the legendary CBS broadcast news pioneer, who took on McCarthy by fact-checking his public statements, closing his show in March 1954, \u201cWe must not confuse dissent with disloyalty. \u2026 We will not be driven by fear into an age of unreason.\u201dBut Murrow vs. McCarthy was a notable exception in a post-war period. Despite the stickiness of who was determining what was fair and balanced, the fairness doctrine proved surprisingly popular among conservatives and liberals who believed it ensured a degree of \u201cpublic interest\u201d programming. When it was overturned by the Federal Communications Commission in 1987, the Senate voted 59-31 to reinstate it on bipartisan lines \u2013by former President Ronald Reagan.This is when partisan media as we know it began to proliferate.One study by former chief economist at the FCC Thomas Winslow Hazlett, recounted in his book \u201c,\u201d found that talk radio took off after the fairness doctrine was dismantled, displacing what had been the most popular radio format: music. Our country got more polarized as partisan opinion became big business, untethered from any obligation to be fair and balanced.Polarization is poisoning America. Here's an antidoteThis was the moment Roger Ailes had been waiting for. A one-time talk show producer-turned-political consultant, Ailes pushed a political strategy called \u201cpositive polarization\u201d in Richard Nixon\u2019s 1968 presidential campaign. While Nixon repeated \u201cthe press is the enemy\u201d like a mantra, Ailesof a conservative news network that could counteract major newspapers and the big three networks.Ailes had the opportunity to operationalize his partisan dream with the launch of Fox News in 1996. Extending the popularity of right-wing talk radio into cable news, the idea was simple and sinister: Only explicit bias could balance the implicit bias of the mainstream media. But in a breathtaking bit of cynicism, this partisan project would be sold as \u201c.\u201dLater that same year, MSNBC launched and evolved into a liberal counterweight. The partisan media arms race was on. But what is good for ratings can be bad for the country.The impact was clear: Just over a decade later, afound that \u201cvirtually every news organization or program has seen its credibility marks decline.\u201d Even C-SPAN, which offers unedited coverage of public events, experienced a steep decline in believability. In this hyper-partisan environment, people literally weren\u2019t trusting what they see with their own eyes.Instead of creating more informed citizens, partisan media compounded tribalism through an echo chamber \u2013 a loose network of blogs, talk radio and partisan cable news that mainstreamed conspiracy theories and increasingly gave talking points to party leaders rather than vice versa.Then came social media. It promised to break down barriers, but instead of simply being a great leveler, it was quickly hijacked by operatives who realized that it was also the greatest vehicle for disinformation ever devised.All these dynamics contributed to the rise of Donald Trump to the presidency. He took his reality television celebrity and morphed it into political influence with weekly segments on \u201cFox and Friends,\u201d where hethe birther conspiracy theory that former President Barack Obama was ineligible to be president.But it was his use of Twitter to hijack news cycles with outrageous statements that really boosted his presidential campaign. What Trump understood better than most is that news doesn\u2019t have a liberal or a conservative bias as much as a conflict bias \u2013 and he supplied constant conflict in ways that fired up his base while dominating news cycles on stations and sites across the political spectrum.The Republican establishment couldn\u2019t stop his rise, because the conservative base had become radicalized by hyper-partisan media while many on the center-right had opted out of the party.It was a joint effort. During the 2016 campaign, Trump relied on regular strategic conversations with Ailes and Sean Hannity, while bringing on the former head of Breitbart News, Steve Bannon, to run his campaign. Put simply, Trump promoted hyper-partisan media, and they promoted him in return.On the most extreme edge, we even learned that the campaign\u2019s senior policy adviser, Stephen Miller,to influence their immigration coverage with white nationalist sites. On a far more prominent and less fringe scale, The Washington Post\u2019s Erik Wemplein campaign emails and called him their \u201cchief propagandist \u2026 looped in on all their talking points, their deflections and their innumerable attacks.\u201dDuring the final weeks of the campaign, when few even inside Trump\u2019s orbit believed he could win,about starting his own right-wing television station \u2013 Trump TV \u2013 to be led by none other than Ailes. It would allow him to monetize the movement he\u2019d begun while continuing its momentum based on the idea that the election had been stolen.But trolls and bots on social media \u2013 many of them connected to Russia \u2013 were engaging in an all-out final push to try to elect Trump, exploiting the environment of extremism and distrust that partisan media created, posting intentionally fake stories at an accelerated rate. In the final three months of the campaign, the top performing intentionally false stories on Facebook \u2013 designed to benefit Trump and hurt Hillary Clinton \u2013the top news stories from actual publications, according to the bipartisan Senate Intelligence Committee report.The top two fake news stories were Pope Francis\u2019 (non-existent) endorsement of Trump and Wikileaks\u2019 \u201cconfirmation\u201d of Hillary Clinton\u2019s weapons sales to ISIS \u2013 which reached more than 1.7 million people. One analyst\u201cit seems pretty clear that false information outperforms true information.\u201dPresident-elect Trump quickly tried to twist the term \u201cfake news\u201d \u2013 which helped him win the election \u2013 to refer to any independent journalism that displeased him in any way. He hassince inauguration, according to Factba.se, while autocrats around the world approvingly picked up the term.Trump's 'social media summit' isn't fearsome, it's pitifulPartisan media was in the White House, and Trump\u2019s relationship with Fox News became something unseen in American history \u2013 with the President constantly watching and tweeting out promos to friendly shows while hiringfrom the extended Fox talent pool.When his staffers burnt out or were forced out, they often found jobs at Fox \u2013 while a few lonely correspondents and anchors such as Shepard Smith committed to facts found themselves under fire from viewers as well as the President.\u201cI\u2019ve never seen anything like it before,\u201d Fox News president-turned-NYU journalism professor Joe Peyronnin. \u201cIt\u2019s as if the President had his own press organization. It\u2019s not healthy.\u201dWe see that partisan media has completed its takeover of the White House \u2013 electing and bolstering an unpopular President while perpetuating a separate political reality for his supporters. But there is a cost to living in that closed environment.The fourth impeachment inquiry in American history was launched because Trumpthat Ukraine \u2013 not Russia \u2013 had hacked the Democratic National Committee while pushing that country\u2019s new President to investigate the family of his chief political rival. These ideasfrom interested parties and fringe sites to being investigated by Trump\u2019s personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani \u2013to The Hill\u2019s John Solomon \u2013 whose articles created \u201cevidence\u201d used to justify the investigation. Solomon would in turn promote his stories on Hannity\u2019s show on Fox News \u2013 creating a confirmation bias feedback loop built on falsehoods, or what the President\u2019s supporters might call \u201calternative facts.\u201dThe media coverage of the subsequent impeachment inquiry hearings was also polarized, with one side focused on testimony and facts, while the other side attacked the State Department and White House witnesses as \u201cNever Trumpers,\u201d \u201c,\u201d \u201cradicals,\u201d \u201cpartisan bureaucrats\u201d and even a \u201c.\u201d There\u2019s an inability to agree on basic facts, and instead the politics of personal attacks seem to have aligned with the President\u2019s talking points.There\u2019s no question that partisan media has driven the polarization that\u2019s afflicting our nation. It is driving the agenda in the White House. And proximity to power creates a gravitational pull toward normalization.But the partisan echo chamber is a route to radicalization. As Cass Sunsteinin his book \u201cGoing to Extremes,\u201d \u201cA good way to create an extremist group, or a cult of any kind, is to separate members from the rest of society. The separation can occur physically or psychologically, by creating a sense of suspicion about non-members. With such separation, the information and views of those outside the group can be discredited, and hence nothing will disturb the process of polarization as group members continue to talk.\u201dPartisan media has gone from advancing an ideological agenda to something uglier, something like a cult that is peddling special knowledge \u2013 undermining our ability to reason together as Americans, while sharpening tribal divides.Confronting this blizzard of lies is one of the defining challenges of our times. To reunite our nation, we must reassert the old wisdom that says everyone is entitled to their own opinion \u2013 but not their own facts \u2013 and report without fear or favor. As James Madison, \u201cTo the press alone, checkered as it is with abuses, the world is indebted for all the triumphs which have been gained by reason and humanity over error and oppression.\u201d"

        "text": "Editor\u2019s Note:Elie Honig is a CNN senior legal analyst and former federal and state prosecutor, and author of \u201c\u201d The views expressed here are his own. Viewon CNN. Watch Honig answer readers\u2019 questions on \u201cCNN Newsroom With Jim Acosta\u201d on weekends.Afterof Judge (likely soon-to-be Justice) Ketanji Brown Jackson, this much is clear: Jackson is eminently qualified, she\u2019s unflappable and she\u2019s virtually certain to be confirmed. Republican senators would be wise to choose their battles. They ought to consider defying recent political convention and throwing their support behind Jackson\u2019s nomination.First thing first. Jackson is: two degrees from Harvard, a mega-prestigious clerkship on the US Supreme Court with Justice(whom she is about to succeed), hands-on work as a public defender and on the US Sentencing Commission, plus nine years as a, both at the trial and appellate levels.As CNN Supreme Court analyst, Jackson has more judicial experience than 43 of the last 58 justices to take the bench, and more than current Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Clarence Thomas, Elena Kagan and Amy Coney Barrett had, combined, when they were confirmed.Not only is Jackson a supremely qualified nominee, but she\u2019s poised to become an important first: the first Black woman to be confirmed to the US Supreme Court. It\u2019s well past time.Even beyond the judge\u2019s sterling resume, she makes for a difficult target politically. In her, she stressed her own family and religious background, including relatives who worked in law enforcement. She hasnot only from Democrats and liberal groups (as expected) but also from prominent conservative judges and lawyers and from the nation\u2019s largest police union.What Ketanji Brown Jackson's hearing revealsThe Senate has confirmed her\u2013 to the US Sentencing Commission, the district court and the appellate court \u2013 most recently just last year when three Republicanher confirmation to the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. Other than reflexive partisanship, there\u2019s no reason why more shouldn\u2019t join this time around.While it\u2019s still not entirely clear how opponents might meaningfully attack Jackson, two general lines of argument emerged during the first day of confirmation hearings. One argument boils down to, essentially,. Senate Minority Leaderlast month that Jackson is the \u201cfavored choice of far-left dark-money groups.\u201dThat\u2019s an attenuated hook, a bank shot, insufficient to overcome the powerful case for confirmation. The argument itself reeks of desperation. Opponents don\u2019t see a strong argument against Jackson herself, so instead they go after others who support her (or, at least, some of them; no mention from McConnell about the aforementioned conservative judges and police unions who endorse Jackson).What kind of justice would Ketanji Brown Jackson be?The second primary thread of opposition to Jackson is that, primarily because of her experience as a public defender, she will be somehow soft on crime \u2013 or, asshe might have \u201cspecial empathy for criminal defendants.\u201d As a longtime former prosecutor, I have no hesitation saying: What\u2019s wrong with that? Typically, we want our judges to have empathy for the parties appearing before them; it\u2019s a core judicial virtue, along with temperance, impartiality and wisdom.Republican Sen. Charles Grassley, the ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, noted correctly that prior conservative nominees, including Roberts and Barrett, had represented criminal defendants during their careers. Buta bogus distinction between what he termed \u201cBill of Rights attorneys\u201d (the good kind of defense lawyers apparently) and \u201c\u2018criminal defense lawyers\u2019 who disagree with our criminal laws\u201d (the bad kind, in Grassley\u2019s view).Of course, that\u2019s a false, overly simplistic reduction; defense lawyers represent their clients zealously, put the government to its burden of proof and ensure constitutional rights and due process for all accused persons.Potential Supreme Court pick is one of the finest judges I've seenThe Republican National Committee has voiced a relatedaimed at Jackson\u2019s prior representation of terrorism suspects detained at Guantanamo Bay. The RNC has complained that her \u201cadvocacy for these terrorists was \u2018zealous,\u2019 going beyond just giving them a competent defense.\u201dThe complaint here seems to be that she did an important job and did it well. Again, this argumentative tack not only falls flat but backfires. It\u2019s the duty of any lawyer to represent her clients not just competently but zealously \u2013 including those who are unpopular, even those who stand accused of horrible acts.It\u2019s unfair to attack Jackson, or any person, for previous criminal defense work. Defense lawyers didn\u2019t commit the crimes at issue, nor do they personally vouch for the acts of their clients. Rather, they serve a vital and necessary role in our constitutional democracy by ensuring due process and protecting the rights of the accused. The fact that Jackson did that job well, and with empathy, should, if anything, work in her favor.In herMonday to the Senate Judiciary Committee, Jackson stressed the bedrock fundamentals of the job: political independence, respect for legal precedent, judicial impartiality and transparency. Jackson expressed her deep respect for country and Constitution.We\u2019ll see, when the hearings resume Tuesday, how Jackson responds directly to potentially hostile questioning. I don\u2019t expect her to take on much damage; if anything, be prepared for the case for confirmation to be even stronger after she has a chance to address her detractors directly. They ultimately might be wise to throw their support behind her."

Nemat is a fellow of the\u2019sproject. The views expressed in this commentary are her own. Viewon CNN.I was 13 years old when the Islamic Revolution toppled the Iranian government in 1979. Though I was a Christian living in a largely Muslim country, I had never felt discrimination because of my faith.My grandmothers had escaped the 1917 Russian Revolution and fled to Iran in search of freedom. And to a certain extent, they had found it. My father had become a successful ballroom dancing instructor in Tehran and taught Muslim couples the cha-cha and the tango. My mother was a hairdresser who styled fashionable Muslim women\u2019s hair. And I had grown up wearing bikinis on the shores of the Caspian Sea, while partying with my Muslim friends.The revolutionary leaders promised to expand social freedoms, grant political ones and build a democracy. They used our grievances against Mohammad Reza Shah Pahlavi, the Shah of Iran, to win our trust and gain power. But as soon as they assumed office, the few personal liberties we had enjoyed vanished and a strict Islamic law was put in place.In less than a year, women\u2019s rights to self-expression were stripped away:,,our boyfriends\u2019 hands in public andall became largely forbidden activities. A few priests from my Roman Catholic Church, all of whom were foreign nationals who had lived in Iran for years, were deported, and several of the properties that belonged to the church were confiscated.I was born in a Chinese 'reeducation camp.' I'm watching history repeat itselfThe irony was that a few of my Christian relatives had trusted Ayatollah Khomeini, the Islamic revolutionary leader, and celebrated when the Shah was forced into exile. Now, they, like me, were paying the price.Though Iran\u2019s transition from a nation of limited social rights to one of virtually none may seem like a distant reality to those living under democracy, the truth is that it is not.If Western democracies are not on guard, their citizens can fall prey to the same kinds of leaders who now control Iran\u2019s political infrastructure. The revolutionary leaders were populists who promised to return power to the people after decades of monarchical rule, and for many disenfranchised voters in democracies who feel their elected officials have ignored their struggles, the populist messaging can have quite a strong appeal \u2013 even if it is just a ploy.But the risk is not only in losing civil or democratic rights, but in being punished for challenging the authority figures who have stripped citizens of those rights.After 1979, our accomplished teachers were replaced by fanatical young academics, many of whom were members of the newly formed Iranian Revolutionary Guard. They spent class time spreading the government\u2019s propaganda and trying to persuade us that the regime\u2019s fanatical rules \u2013 likeand girls over age 9 to wear the hijab \u2013 were for our own good. They argued that we had to dress modestly so that we would not attract unwanted attention from men.At the time, I told our principal that I was a Christian, so the new Islamic rules of modesty should not apply to me. She responded, \u201cYou believe in the wrong religion.\u201d I was politically na\u00efve, but I was also aggrieved, having experienced firsthand why freedom of religion mattered. I attended protest rallies to express my frustration with the new religious laws that limited or attacked the rights of Iranian women.Speaking out against the regime, in any shape or form, was now considered an act of war against God \u2013 the penalty for which could be death. And, in January 1982, the Revolutionary Guard arrested me for doing just that. At only 16, Iof being an anti-revolutionary and sent to the notorious Evin prison. I was tortured, physically and emotionally, and then I was forced to marry one of my interrogators, who was assassinated 15 months after the marriage.The fiercest fight of the 21st century -- to save democracySix months after his death \u2013 and two years, two months and 12 days after my initial arrest \u2013 I was released. My captors had decided that there was no reason to keep me any longer, perhaps because they had succeeded in destroying my spirit and suppressing my desire to protest. Many of my friends and cellmates had been executed while I was in prison, and I was suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder \u2013 not that I knew it at the time. I was just shy of 19 years of age when I was released.Though it took me several years \u2013 and a move to Canada \u2013 before I shared the details of my tragic story, I determined to do so because a democracy is only as good as its citizens. Now, living in the West, I have become acutely aware that even the strongest democracies are not immune to demagogues parading as populists. Those of us who have experienced what the loss of basic rights looks and feels like have an obligation to speak up. Because once the demagogues \u2013 or aspiring ones \u2013  have assumed control, it will be too late.Indeed, democracy is like water caught in the palm of our hands. If we do not focus on holding onto it, the water will drip away through our fingers, and we will be left with nothing but a burning thirst.Though Iran was not a democracy before the revolution, any hope of a peaceful transition to one post-revolution has all but faded today. The Islamic Republic of Iran, holding elections for its parliament and president. Yet, its Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Khamenei, who replaced Ayatollah Khomeini after his death, and his Guardian Council decide who is or is not fit to run in elections.And it certainly does not have a thrivingor civil society. Anyone who criticizes the regime and its officialsand even condemned to death.The line that separates democracy from tyranny is not as thick as Westerners might choose to believe. In Iran, we believed that our good will, selfless efforts and desire for better governance could not possibly be manipulated and destroyed. Many of us even died during the revolution to bring the Islamic Republic into existence. But we were wrong, and we have been paying the price for close to half a century."

He is a fellow of the\u2019sproject. The opinions expressed in this commentary are those of the author. View moreon CNN.For many people, freedom is an abstract concept. It\u2019s like breathing; you don\u2019t think about it until you are gasping for air.The same thing happens with democracy. Too many voters take it for granted, until the moment they realize it\u2019s entirely possible to have an election without democracy \u2013 just like in,,, and my home country of.This became painfully clear to me while I was imprisoned for political opposition to President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro\u2019sIn a 2x2 meter cell with a lock the size of a brick, I learned what freedom was when I didn\u2019t have it.The Venezuela I was born into in the 1970s was considered the envy of the Americas: a country with a strong economy capable of providing prosperity and opportunities to almost everybody. Venezuelan leaders had successfully built this regime of freedom after the downfall of Marcos P\u00e9rez Jim\u00e9nez\u2019sin 1958. Between the, Venezuela was \u201c\u201d in Latin America, a title that every Venezuelan carried with pride.My country had some of theof the region during that time \u2013 including a prestigious network of schools and universities and a health care system that helped eradicate malaria in parts of the country in 1961,by the World Health Organization (WHO), a status Venezuela has since lost. This was an era when many Europeans and Latin Americans alike wanted to emigrate to Venezuela for a better life.The fiercest fight of the 21st century -- to save democracyNow, 22 years after Hugo Ch\u00e1vez\u2019s presidency began and nearly a decade after Maduro seized power in what I believe was a, Venezuela is undergoing thein the continent.,, starvation, andof crucial supplies are the new normal. A 2016 survey found that almostof the population involuntarily lost an average of 19 pounds, with emergency rooms overwhelmed by cases ofchildren.Hospitalsthe equipment and medicine they need to function, leaving families across the country at risk of dyingto treatment \u2013 a situation aggravated by the Covid-19 pandemic.Venezuelans have fled the country, many for fear of persecution or lack of economic opportunities.How did we turn from being an island of democracy to a broken dictatorship? I think the answer is twofold: First, we suffered an erosion of the essential elements of democracy. After becoming president in 1999, within a year, Ch\u00e1vezthe national constitution and called for a \u201cmega-election\u201d that saw him inaugurated for a six-year term. He changed theof the country;the Supreme Court;over the National Electoral Council; andcritical members of the free press as \u201cenemies of the homeland.\u201dYour rights could be taken away rapidly. I know because it happened to meSecond, this democratic erosion was met with an immoral neutrality from democracies around the world. When we the Venezuelans were losing our freedoms, too many people in the region believed that our problem was not also their own. I witnessed this tragedy from my position as a local politician.After studying abroad in the US in the early 1990s, I returned to Venezuela and ran for public office in 2000. I was elected and reelected as mayor of Chacao, a powerful municipality in Caracas that is home to almost 80,000 people. For eight years, we proved that it was possible to serve democratically in a country being led in the opposite direction.That changed in 2008, when I was disqualified from running for governor of Caracas city, despite two consecutive successful terms as mayor of Chacao and over 70% popular support. Under Ch\u00e1vez, the National Comptroller banned my participation in any electoral process on charges of corruption and financial impropriety \u2013 a ban that went into effecteven formally charged with these false accusations. With no place to look for justice within my country, I took my case to the Inter-American Court of Human Rights, and I. In response, Ch\u00e1vez\u2019s regimeVenezuela from the inter-American system and, naturally, dismissed the ruling in my favor.Unable to serve, I visited towns and cities across the country, from the Colombian border to the Atlantic coast. I wanted to prove that it wasn\u2019t necessary to be an elected authority to serve our people. What I saw on that journey were Venezuelans who were more than ready to fight for freedom and democracy. That experience led me, along with other democratic leaders, to establish the political party Voluntad Popular, a national movement steeped in grassroots activism.When Ch\u00e1vez\u2019s successor, Maduro, rose to power in 2013, I asked our movement, \u201cAre we living in a democracy, or a dictatorship?\u201d We agreed on the latter. Inspired by nonviolent resistance from around the world, including the Orange Revolution, the Arab Spring, and US civil rights movements, we chose to peacefully protest Maduro\u2019s regime.The Venezuelan government\u2019s response to our demonstrations was ruthless, and strikingly similar to what we have seen reported from the streets of countries around the world, from Belarus to Nicaragua: police brutality against peaceful protesters, arbitrary arrests and torture of opposition leaders, protesters sent into exile and some killed, as the UN has documented.In February 2014, Maduromy arrest and that of other Voluntad Popular members. Despite international criticism that I was, I was prosecuted and sentenced to nearly 14 years after a trial controlled by the dictatorship \u2013 proceedings the UNfor lack of transparency and violation of due process. I spent more than three years in a military prison, where I endured physical and psychological torture. Whenand other supporterswhat was happening to me, Maduro\u2019s governmentthe abuse.Many ask why Maduro is still in power, despite massive and. The truth is that he\u2019s in power because he\u2019s a dictator, and his regime\u2019s response has been the same as others: repression and incarceration, the dictator\u2019s recipe to hold on to power.Perhaps we need to understand that authoritarianism is a global phenomenon. Dictators, in fact, understand this very well. They form political allegiances to protect each other internationally and have developed ain order to persecute those who oppose them. This is a global problem, and its solution should be global as well.To achieve democratic change in Venezuela, we must be part of a larger, globally organized effort. This idea is what convinced me to risk my lifefrom my country last year to resettle in Spain: A desire to be part of an international front that would help not only the people of Venezuela, but all those who live under authoritarian regimes."

Within a matter of months, she and her fellow Iranians lost the limited rights they had enjoyed under the country\u2019s previous government, itself a repressive monarchy.When Nemat dared to protest against the new regime, she was arrested and sent to the notorious, where shethe next two-plus years, released just shy of 19 \u2013 alive, but deeply broken. From that traumatizing time, sheshe learned \u201cthose of us who have experienced what the loss of basic rights looks and feels like have an obligation to speak up.\u201dWai Hnin Pwint Thon was already four years old when she first met her father, Ko Mya Aye, a democratic activist who had beenfor leading a peaceful protest against the military dictatorship in Burma (now known as Myanmar) in 1988.Though at first she thought he was being treated well, the iron bars that prevented her from embracing her father soon jolted Wai Hnin to reality. In that moment, she says, a child became an aspiring voice for human rights, one who would speak out over the nearly three decades since that meeting \u2013 as her father was repeatedly imprisoned, most recently after the military\u2019s February coup.Wai Hnin, now living in exile,that her father\u2019s \u201ccommitment to helping build a lasting democracy in Burma has taught me that an equal and just political system is not a guarantee. It requires hard work.\u201dEvan Mawarire never got to experience freedom in his country.

Corruption was rampant, deflationhyperinflation, and free and fair elections were long gone.His decision to post a, in which he draped himself in the country\u2019s flag while giving an impassioned lament for the current state of Zimbabwe, was a huge risk. Still, Mawarire tells CNN, he got to the point where he realized \u201cno one else is going to fight for this country with as much passion and commitment as I am.\u201d He was later imprisoned for his political activism and, like Nemat and Wai Hnin, now lives in exile.Mawarire, Nemat and Wai Hnin are among the 21st century\u2019s freedom fighters \u2013 people who have risked their lives and liberty in a battle for democracy that is being fought globally. In this series, \u201cVoices of Freedom,\u201d 13 dissidents from around the world are telling their stories and making the case for supporters of democracy to fight for restoring and protecting the rights to speak freely and vote in honest elections. They are active participants in the(RDI), a nonprofit dedicated to promoting democratic values at home and abroad.The stakes could not be higher. Freedom House, a nonprofit research organization, put this battle in almost apocalyptic terms in its annual report on liberty. \u201cAs a lethal pandemic, economic and physical insecurity, and violent conflict ravaged the world in 2020, democracy\u2019s defenders sustained heavy new losses in their struggle against authoritarian foes, shifting the international balance in favor of tyranny,\u201dFreedom House\u2019s Sarah Repucci and Amy Slipowitz. \u201cIncumbent leaders increasingly used force to crush opponents and settle scores, sometimes in the name of public health, while beleaguered activists\u2014lacking effective international support\u2014faced heavy jail sentences, torture, or murder in many settings.\u201dThe organization labeled 2020 \u201cthe 15th consecutive year of decline in global freedom\u201d and determined thatof the world\u2019s population now lives in truly free countries. Among the countries where democracy is under assault is the world\u2019s longest lived modern democratic government: the United States.On Jan. 6, 2021, hundreds of insurrectioniststhe citadel of US democracy \u2013 the Capitol \u2013 in an effort steal the 2020 presidential election from Joe Biden. For the first time in modern American history, a small but violent group of US citizens refused to accept the peaceful transfer of political power \u2013 and they showed how willing they were to go to extreme ends to try and keep then-President Donald Trump in office.Five peoplethat day, including one Capitol Police officer. And, according to a Department of Justice filing, the riotersan estimated $1.5 million in damages to the Capitol building.Though their efforts ultimately failed, the threat of another insurrection looms large over future US elections. A March poll from the Public Religion Research Institute and the Interfaith Youth Corethat 15% of Americans believe that \u201cpatriots may have to resort to violence in order to save our country.\u201dEqually alarming is that, according to a late summer CNN poll,believe it\u2019s \u201cat least somewhat likely that an election in the next few years will be overturned by elected officials because their party lost.\u201d When Americans do not have faith in the integrity of their elections, the impact worldwide can be devastating, says Gambian dissident Fatou Jaw Manneh.As she has struggled to build a young democracy in her home country, Manneh writes, \u201cit wasn\u2019t just American influence that made me demand better from the Gambian government \u2013 it was knowing that America was there that made me believe that I could succeed.\u201d Imperfect and as unequal as it may be, she says, the United States \u201cis still the most potent global force for freedom, and without it the world\u2026 faces a dark future.\u201dCompounding problems, economic forces \u2013 including growing inequality \u2013 and the challenges of the Covid-19 pandemic have put new stress on nations struggling with the challenge of autocracy. China and Russia are among the nations that are seeking to demonstrate that their systems of governancecitizens with\u2013 and without the freedoms taken for granted in the west.However, the Chinese government rejects the authoritarian label. In September, the Chinese Ambassador to the US, Qin Gang,claiming China had a \u201cwhole-process democracy,\u201d a system he said was built on the tenets of the Chinese constitution, which \u201cprescribes that all power belongs to the people. The people have the right to election, and they can be broadly involved in national governance according to law.\u201dThese words follow a familiar pattern from Chinese officials who,, have made misleading claims about the true nature of Beijing\u2019s political system, Isaac Stone Fish, CEO of Strategy Risks, a China-focused research firm, explains to CNN. Though the Chinese government does hold elections, they are neither free nor fair nor representative of the will of the people,a 2021 Freedom House report, which also documented how Chinese President Xi Jinping used the pandemic to further expand his party\u2019s surveillance of the Chinese people.There is a point to this game of political semantics, says Stone Fish. It forces a debate within the US and other western democracies about something that should be obvious \u2013 that China\u2019s government does not meet any internationally accepted definition of democracy. It also helps to distract from allegations of human rights abuses against ethnic minorities, censorship of the press and crackdowns on civil society (all of which the Chinese government denies).But this debate does not negate a reality that many leaders of western democracies are acutely aware of \u2013 awith their own form of government. At his first press conference in March of this year, US President Joe Biden, \u201cThis is a battle between the utility of democracies in the 21st century and autocracies\u2026We\u2019ve got to prove democracy works.\u201dThere is one feature all democracies share in common \u2013 they give power to the people, whether directly or through some form of elected representation. For activist and RDI chairman Garry Kasparov, who has been on the frontlines of battling Russian repression for over three decades, that\u2019s a system worth fighting for \u2013 even if it comes at great cost.He, \u201cHailing from the Soviet Union\u2026 a precursor to [President Vladimir] Putin\u2019s Russia, I have always understood that democracy is a privilege \u2013 one that must constantly be defended.\u201d Whether protesting the sentencing of Putin\u2019s critics or taking to the streets of Moscow to demand free and fair elections, Kasparov, now living in exile, believes that democracy is an active sport that requires all of its citizens to participate.Sheri Berman, a professor of political science at Barnard College, tells CNN that an active citizenry is a hallmark of democracy. She argues that strong democracies have robust civil societies capable of engaging in the kinds of collective action Kasparov initiated in Russia but was arrested for partaking in.Simply put, citizens living in democracies should be able to express their dissent without risking retribution. And, Berman explains, they have multiple mechanisms to do so \u2013 whether by voting in elections in which two or more political parties are on the ballot, bringing lawsuits before an independent judiciary, writing or calling their elected leaders or taking to the streets in protest.Beyond the political characteristics that define a democracy, there are the social and economic factors that are critical to its success, says Berman. A real democracy must provide some form of social equality to all of its citizens, regardless of gender, race, religion or ethnicity.For Wai Hnin, social equality is one feature that has been sorely missing from Myanmar\u2019s government, even as it instituted some democratic reforms prior to this year\u2019s military coup.The most obvious example is the horrendous treatment of the country\u2019s Muslim minority, the Rohingya. In late 2016, the Burmese military beganthe \u201ctextbook example of ethnic cleansing\u201d of the Rohingya, according to the United Nations human rights commissioner \u2013 driving hundreds of thousands of Rohingya survivors into neighboring Bangladesh. (The Burmese military hasthese allegations.)Though Myanmar\u2019s 2008 constitution forbids discrimination against any religious or ethnic minority, it also includes a sectionthe \u201cspecial position of Buddhism as the faith professed by the great majority of the citizens.\u201d This ambiguity in the wording \u2013 combined with the power and influence of the Buddhist nationalists \u2013 has meant that minorities like the Rohingya have never been treated equally in civil society and have never had adequate representation in government under this constitution.But just as important as social equality is economic equality, which \u2013 when secured \u2013 gives citizens the opportunity to focus on other pressing issues. Unfortunately, according to Thomas Carothers, senior vice president for studies at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, over the last four years,have been driving factors of protests across the world \u2013 from Argentina to Egypt, France to India.He and former Carnegie fellow David Wongthat this backlash is \u201ca late-stage warning gong for capitalism,\u201d arguing that public anger over various market failings, including the \u201cdislocation and insecurity in the middle class\u201d are behind the protests. And if democratic governments continue to let economic inequality grow, they will contribute to a growing sense that democracy cannot deliver for the people \u2013 leaving an opening for radical leaders to step in, Oliver Della Costa Stuenkel, associate professor of international relations at the Get\u00falio Vargas Foundation in S\u00e3o Paulo, explains to CNN.In Brazil, Jair Bolsonaro, a far-right politician who might not have been competitive otherwise,to capitalize on the economic unrest in his successful bid for the presidency in 2018. As the country sunk deeper into a recession that began in 2014, and as a major corruption scandal plagued his predecessor\u2019s administration, Bolsonaro positioned himself as a viable alternative. However, Stuenkel says, Bolsonaro did not necessarily win \u201cbecause people thought he had better [economic] answers, but because part of the population didn\u2019t have much to lose.\u201dBolsonaro\u2019s campaign was built on one of the biggest criticisms of western democracy today \u2013 that even though citizens may still freely vote for their elected leaders, many of those leaders are self-serving elites who are out of touch with the economic and social needs of those they supposedly serve. That logic, Stuenkel explains, \u201cmakes putting a radical who\u2026lacks any qualification to govern a more appealing option.\u201dIt goes far beyond Brazil. Across the world, far-right and far-left leaders have exploited people\u2019s dissatisfaction with political elites and their maintenance of the status quo, Michael Abramowitz, President of Freedom House, tells CNN.Hungary offers a powerful example. In the 2010 election, Hungariansfor Viktor Orb\u00e1n\u2019s Fidesz Party, kicking out the socialist government which had run the country for eight years. With unemployment creeping into the double digits and the economy contracting over the previous year, the conditions were ripe for Orb\u00e1n to offer a different vision \u2013 one in which Hungarians could prosper.And, according to several metrics, Orb\u00e1n has addressed some of these dire economic realities. As of 2018, when he was elected for a third time, Hungary\u2019s official unemployment figures and government debt, its credit rating had improved and its budget deficit had been approximately halved.Any economic gains have not come without a high political price, though. Since Orb\u00e1n became prime minister, he and his party have chipped away at Hungarian democracy, pushing through a series of significant constitutional and legislative changes that have expanded his control of many of the country\u2019s independent institutions \u2013.More recently, his government \u201chas moved to institute policies that hamper the operations of opposition groups, journalists, universities, and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) who criticize it or whose perspectives it otherwise finds unfavorable,\u201da Freedom House analysis. Though once a highly-rated democracy, according to the latest Freedom House rankings Hungary isas partly free \u2013 and stands to drop further in the rankings if it continues on its current course.Dissatisfaction with the status quo isn\u2019t the only factor undermining democracies today. Abramowitz explains there have been dramatic changes in our \u201cinformation environment.\u201d In the early days of the internet and social media, activistsat using new information technologies to serve their democratic causes. But, in recent years, dictators and those who aspire to be them have learned how to use these technologies to serve their political agendas.One recent example is Russian attempts to impact democratic elections abroad with digital disinformation campaigns. Steven Wilson, an assistant professor of politics at Brandeis University,that these digital campaigns \u2013 often run across social media platforms \u2013 \u201cexploit existing political fault lines like race and regionalism to increase polarization and disaffection with the political system.\u201d The consequence is an erosion of citizens\u2019 trust in institutions and each other. And without trust, he argues, democracy cannot thrive.One country where the impact of these kinds of campaigns has been felt is. According to a declassified US intelligence report, TrumpRussian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s pick for US president in 2016, and Russia used a two-part disinformation strategy to persuade the American public to vote against Hillary Clinton. As the report details, the Kremlin combined covert cyber intelligence operations targeting individuals and parties associated with the US presidential election, as well as overt efforts by Russian government agencies, third party intermediaries and paid digital trolls targeting American citizens.And while Trump\u2019s 2016 electoral victory cannot be entirely credited to Putin, it appears Russian efforts succeeded in both undermining some Americans\u2019 faith in US democracy and in giving Putin a disinformation playbook he could apply \u201cto future influence efforts in the United States and worldwide, including against US allies and their election processes,\u201d.Indeed, the US intelligence community assessed that Putin, although unsuccessful in swaying the election in Trump\u2019s favor,in the 2020 US presidential election. But the same assessment revealed an even more disturbing trend \u2013 Russia was not the only regime waging information warfare in the US. Iran, Venezuela and Cuba each tried to sway American public opinion during the same election cycle. (in US elections.)According to Abramowitz, this is part of a dangerous pattern of copycat behavior among autocrats \u2013 learning worst practices from each other and using them to undermine trust in democracy.This web of digital disinformation has only exacerbated Americans\u2019 loss of faith in government and institutions, whichon the decline even before the 2016 election, according to the Pew Research Center. And while trust in government tends to be higher among the party which controls the US presidency, even in April of this year Pew shows thatof Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents said they trusted in the US government. That number dropped dramatically to 9% among Republicans and Republican-leaning independents.The clearest driver of distrust in US democracy is Trump\u2019s lie that he really won the 2020 election. Despite any evidence of systematic voter fraud, Trump and his loyalists continue to sow doubt about Biden\u2019s victory in the minds of the American people \u2013 at, through, inand in. According to a CNN poll from August and early September 2021, they are achieving some degree of success. 36% of Americans \u2013 and a startling 78% of Republicans \u2013 now believe Biden did not win enough votes to be the legitimately elected president.At the Oslo Freedom Forum in October, Venezuelan opposition leader Leopoldo L\u00f3pezthat the world did not have to settle for a dark future. Those who believe in the fundamentals of freedom could win the war against dictatorship \u2013 but they need to be united and organized, and  they require assistance from leading democracies like the United States.This is no easy task. Hahrie Han, a professor of political science at Johns Hopkins University, explains to CNN that democracy is only as strong as people\u2019s commitment to it, and that commitment has waned in recent years. However, civic institutions \u2013 from schools to houses of worship to social clubs \u2013 can play a key role in strengthening democracies at home and abroad.Fundamentally, democracies demand that citizens accept they may not always get the electoral outcome that they want. Civic institutions, where people begin to encounter individuals and ideas they may disagree with, can teach the values of negotiation, compromise and even acceptance of a less than desirable outcome, she says.Linda Chavez, a conservative political commentator and RDI board member, believes the most important civic institution may be schools. In the US, she tells CNN, many students have received a \u201ccomic book version of history with superheroes and supervillains,\u201d but without a deeper understanding of the struggle to expand American democracy to more and more citizens.It\u2019s no surprise, Chavez says, thathas become a defining feature of the 18 to 29-year-old demographic in the US (though 2020 did see anin voter turnout among this cohort). If students spend time reading through the original documents that shaped American democracy \u2013 from the Federalist Papers to the US Constitution to the 1964 Civil Rights Act \u2013 Chavez reasons that students will not simply bemoan how unequal the US has historically been, but take pride in the multi-century struggle Americans have endured to expand civil rights and liberties. And perhaps they will feel more motivated to take part in that democratic struggle moving forward.While civic education is a critical piece of the democratic puzzle, there are additional efforts that must be taken to strengthen US commitment to democracy. And one of them must target the many Americans who have come to believe Trump\u2019s election lies.Chavez says that conservatives must lead that effort. \u201cThe Constitution \u2013 which conservatives have always claimed to owe allegiance to \u2013 is under attack. Trump\u2019s tenure was marked by his flouting of the rule of law and separation of powers, and now he is being aided by those who previously claimed to [be] champions of those very principles,\u201d she writes to CNN. Chavez hopes that Republicans like Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming, though in the minority, can serve as models for speaking truth to Trump and his allies\u2019 dangerous assertions of power.Beyond outreach to disbelieving Republicans, Ruth Ben-Ghiat, a professor of history and Italian studies at New York University, tells CNN that democratic activists must tap into the American population which does not vote or participate in the political process at all.In the 2020 US presidential election, which saw record voter turnout, about 80 million eligible voters still. According to, there are several reasons people cite for not voting, but chief among them is feeling disinterested in the political process. A 2020 Medill/NPR/Ipsos pollthe census findings \u2013 almost a quarter of nonvoters said they were uninterested in politics and almost a third of nonvoters said they had not even registered to vote. According to aof this poll, these nonvoters \u201care disengaged, disaffected and don\u2019t believe politics can make a difference in their lives.\u201dBen-Ghiat explains that voter registration and mobilization efforts must target these potential voters \u2013 and must do a more effective job at explaining how their votes can translate into concrete actions by elected representatives.Carothers says one way to plead this case is to show proof of concept. When Congress and the White House are able to work together to solve pressing issues facing the American public \u2013 such as economic inequality or aging infrastructure \u2013 they can argue that a system of governance, often plagued by gridlock, can also be a force for good in people\u2019s day-to-day lives.And while this may seem an impossible task against the backdrop of America\u2019s fractured politics, it is urgent that the nation\u2019s elected leaders and citizens model the kind of behavior befitting a democracy. After the events of Jan. 6, RDI began hearing from activists and dissidents about the need for the US to quickly change course and set a worldwide example for true freedom. They wanted to \u201cremind us of the importance of America\u2019s founding values to our own success and to the global community as a whole,\u201d Uriel Epshtein, Executive Director of RDI, tells CNN.In response, RDI launched theproject. It features an, signed by 52 dissidents from 28 countries, in which they argue, \u201cIf the world\u2019s leading democracy doesn\u2019t believe in its own values, why should dictators even bother paying lip service to them? We must defend these principles that inspire advocates of liberty and provide a crucial check on tyrants.\u201dBeyond a firm commitment to secure voting rights and uphold democratic election results, those principles include protecting free speech and free press rights. As the signatories explain, we cannot defeat \u201cilliberalism with illiberalism,\u201d but rather with the creation of a space where ideas and opinions, however controversial or provocative, may be shared and debated.As democratic legislative bodies debate the parameters of these freedoms, they can still invest time and resources in strengthening civil society. And while a robust civil society is critical to the maintenance of democracies, it is perhaps even more critical in countries where activists are trying to lay the foundations of democracy.For example, retired Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, a whistleblower during the Trump administration, and Belarussian dissident Andrei Sannikovthat for Belarus to succeed in moving away from an autocracy that has governed its country for over 25 years, it \u201cwill require the collective action of other western nations committed to the values and principles of basic human rights and freedoms.\u201d The United States could take lead on this by \u201cproviding material and ideological support to the country\u2019s pro-democracy elements.\u201dThis kind of aid is far more practical, explains Roland Rich, an assistant teaching professor at Rutgers University and former Australian diplomat. Government-to-government aid, especially when one of the parties involved is not a democracy, is often highly ineffective in bringing about tangible change. However, he argues, \u201cpeople-to-people aid\u201d can empower citizens and civil society to organize and push for the freedoms they deserve.For Mawarire, who continues the struggle for democracy in Zimbabwe, Rich\u2019s thinking mirrors his mobilization efforts on the ground. He explains that one of his country\u2019s democratic slogans has become, \u201cIf we cannot cause the politician to change, then we must inspire the citizen to be bold.\u201dAnd while international support for democratic efforts can often play a critical role, Mawarire believes that much of the push for freedom must come from within countries where citizens are struggling against the weight of autocracy. The beauty of his advocacy work, he says, is helping fellow Zimbabweans recognize their agency in the political process and then driving them to say, \u201cI\u2019m not going to sit in the terraces or bleachers to watch other people [build democracy]. I\u2019m doing it myself.\u201dDemocracy does not blossom overnight. Mawarire compares it to growing a garden and waiting patiently for the seeds of freedom to blossom. It may take time, but \u201cthere\u2019s going to be a generation that\u2019s going to harvest the fruits of democracy,\u201d he says. Until then, all those who believe in the values of a free and open society must tend to the garden, watering, cultivating, and, when necessary, removing the weeds of autocracy that threaten to compromise its growth."

The views expressed in this commentary are his own. View moreon CNN.If you want to understand how American politics has become more polarized and extreme over the last decade, look no farther than Asheville, North Carolina \u2013 now split between two of the most gerrymandered districts in the country.\u2013 the dark art of drawing political maps to favor one party and disadvantage the other, which can be traced back to the earliest days of the nation \u2013 fundamentally altered the nature of political representation in the largest city in western North Carolina.Artists, independent spirits and environmentalists have traditionally flocked to this hippie enclave, surrounded by conservative hill towns, for the majestic Blue Ridge Mountains, thriving local brewpubs, vegan cafes and independent bookstores.And, a decade ago, North Carolina\u2019s 11th congressional district, with Asheville at its heart, was among the nation\u2019s most competitive, see-sawing with shifting political winds.the two elections that followed the September 11 attacks, then veered toward Democrats beginning in 2006 as the Iraq war stagnated and stock market tumbled.This district does not swing any longer. Asheville is now represented by two of the most conservative, including the outgoing chairman of the House Freedom Caucus, who have won their races since 2012 by.Why? Because while the old map preserved Asheville in one competitive district, the new one sliced the city in half, scattering its voters across two districts in a way that ensured a Republican captured both seats.North Carolina court steps up to defend democracyBut when the 11th district switched from a toss-up to safely Republican, the entire political dynamic changed. Without a competitive general election, the real action moved to the GOP primary, where turnout tends to be lower, and limited to the activist base. Only the most ideological extreme candidates stood a chance.Enter Mark Meadows, who won the 2012 GOP primary here with a vow to \u201c.\u201d He\u2019s held the seat since. Once arriving in Washington, Meadows ousted then-GOP Speaker John Boehner with a parliamentary maneuver, and became, as well as multiple Obamacare repeal efforts. And he\u2019s now one of President Donald Trump\u2019s most ardent defenders against impeachment.Not surprisingly, many locals are unhappy with this reality. \u201cThe majority of the electorate in Asheville feels that their views are not represented in Congress,\u201d. The matter is not settled;the congressional map from being used in 2020 elections.Of course, this story is not unique to Asheville. All over the country, partisans have cracked cities in two, drawn districts that look like Donald Duck kicking Goofy and exploited new technology and advanced data to maximize gains.And the consequences for democracy continue to be catastrophic, locking in a new era of minority rule across multiple states, distorting the competitive balance of congressional delegations and placing public policy \u2013 and many politicians \u2013 beyond the reach of the ballot box.But which came first: the extreme gerrymanders or the heightened polarization? The reality is that each acts as an accelerant on the other, exacerbating a situation these politicians candidly describe inbefore the US Supreme Court as a Montague vs. Capulet-styled Shakespearean bloodbath.Gerrymandered districts have also helped create an epidemic of minority rule nationwide, driving state politics to extremes not supported by voters who find themselves unable to do anything about it.live in a state where one or both chambers of legislature is controlled by the party that won fewer statewide votes in the 2018 election.with fair lines, 59 congressional seats would have changed hands in 2012, 2014 and 2016. (Republicans gained 39 seats they would not have won; Democrats secured 20.)What's pulling America apart?Of course, gerrymandering has been. The bad news for democracy is that we\u2019re better at gerrymandering than ever before., sophisticated mapping software and terabytes of voter, census and consumer data \u2013 alongside growing polarization \u2013 make it possible to draw surgical district lines that provide sturdy bulwarks against electoral waves and maximize partisan advantage across an entire state.It\u2019s more than geography: Multiple academic studies, involving tens of thousands of neutral maps, consistently show that the partisan-drawn maps in the most gerrymandered states are radical outliers.Neither political party has more historical virtue when it comes to gerrymandering, but GOP strategists outplayed their DNC counterparts ahead of the 2010 election, recognizing that redistricting provided a pathafter the party\u2019s 2008 walloping at the hands of President Barack Obama.In fact, the GOP invested $30 million intoin closely divided states like Ohio, Wisconsin and North Carolina, seeking to win full control of congressional and state legislative maps. The lines Republicans drew the following year stuck.It was a political masterstroke: Every 10 years, following the census, congressional lines are redrawn to account for population changes. In most states, the state legislature takes the lead, so the GOP\u2019s modest investment paid handsome dividends. (As a result, Democrats controlled the process in fewer states than Republicans, so they lacked the same opportunities to gerrymander in 2010. They did take full advantage of their biggest opportunity, drawing a map thatin Maryland all the way to 7-1.)But most Americans vote in uncompetitive districts, where the outcome is pre-ordained and reflective of only the most partisan extremes. Uncompetitive districts elect a different kind of politician, who is then incentivized to cater only to their base.Congress, meanwhile, has an, yet upward ofcoast to re-election. No wonder Americans feel frustrated.It doesn\u2019t have to be this way. Americansand believe in fair elections, evident by the various initiatives and constitutional amendments that passed in 2018, including successful efforts to stop politicians from drawing their own districts and choosing their own voters in,,and.Many of our national divisions are real and difficult to bridge. Gerrymandering, however, is self-inflicted. We\u2019ve done this to ourselves \u2013 but we can undo it, too."

        "text": "Editor\u2019s Note:Wai Hnin Pwint Thon is a Burmese human rights activist working for the nongovernmental organization Burma Campaign UK. She has been advocating for human rights and federal democracy in Burma, now widely known as Myanmar, for over a decade. Wai Hnin is also a fellow of the\u2019sproject. The views expressed in this commentary are her own. Viewon CNN.I was 4 years old when my mom took me to meet my dad for the first time. I thought we were traveling to a park or a playground, but then we arrived outside Insein prison in Rangoon (present day Yangon), Burma, and I was even more impressed. It was a massive compound with an imposing red entrance and more guards than I could count.\u201cIs daddy very wealthy?,\u201d I asked. My mom told me to keep quiet and stay close to her. Men in uniform drilled her with questions, while other guards rummaged through the gifts that we had brought for my dad.After waiting for hours in the scorching sun, we were finally allowed into a room where we met a man dressed in all white, and in handcuffs and shackles. I recognized him instantly \u2013 this was my father whose photo had hung on a glass cabinet in my house for as far back as I could remember. His wild hair from the photo wasn\u2019t so wild anymore, but he still had that friendly smile on his face. I wanted to hug him, even though there were iron bars between us. I reached out my fingers so I could at least touch his hand.Although this first meeting happened almost three decades ago, I can so clearly remember it. That was the day I realized that my dad was a prisoner being kept by these guards. And those \u201cgifts\u201d that we brought for him? They were essential food and medicine, which he needed to stay alive behind these foreboding concrete walls.My father was first sent to prison for leading a peaceful protest against the Burmese military dictatorship in 1988. He wasof students who marched on the street calling for democracy, human rights and freedom in my country. Since then, he has been in and out of prison for continuing to protest military rule and advocating for human rights.But his commitment to helping build a lasting democracy in Burma has taught me that an equal and just political system is not a guarantee. It requires hard work, and it could come with serious consequences \u2013 not just for my family or country but for the world at large.Following my first meeting with my father, I began to study the history of Burma. I learned that itan oppressive military dictatorship since 1962. I also read how the military ruthlessly killed many peaceful protesters during the 1988 uprising and how they imprisoned thousands of civilians for simply believing in democracy and freedom. Though military regimes have come and gone since then, the military today \u2013 though it denies its brutality \u2013to commit atrocities with impunity, according to the United Nations Deputy High Commissioner for Human Rights.The more I learned, the more certain I was that I needed to follow in my father\u2019s footsteps. Though my father urged me to choose a different path, I refused to heed his warnings.I thought I might pursue teaching, since I believed education could play a crucial role in driving social change and empowering young people to fight for their rights. But because of my father\u2019s political activities, I was denied entrance into any Burmese university. And so, in 2007, I arrived in the United Kingdom to study international relations. That same year, my fathera second time for leading another peaceful protest. Even though I was thousands of miles away, I started campaigning for the release of all political prisoners in Burma \u2013 including my father.Your rights could be taken away rapidly. I know because it happened to meBut what I had not fully anticipated was the consequence I would face from the Burmese government. Having used my voice abroad, I could no longer return home without facing the possibility of arrest. I subsequently became a political dissident in exile.In 2008, caving to a combination of internal and external pressures, the Burmese military regimea new constitution, which while safeguarding much of their power, offered limited democratic and social reforms. Two years later, they released Aung San Suu Kyi, an opposition leader who had spentin detention, and allowed her to stand for elections in April 2012.Forand much of the international community, Suu Kyi\u2019s freedom \u2013 and her party\u2019sin 2015 \u2013 marked a significant milestone in my country\u2019s journey toward democracy. But it did not fully capture the subtle and not so subtle ways that the military continued to hold a tight grip on Burma.While the new constitution and Suu Kyi\u2019s government provided a wider space for civil society \u2013 and greater access to tools like social media and the internet \u2013 the military still hadandof MPs in the parliament. And while many of these social reforms were enacted in cities, the militaryto torture, rape and kill ethnic civilians in more rural areas, according to an independent report requested by the UN Human Rights Council.What I learned about freedom from a 2x2 Venezuelan prison cellDespitefrom human rights activists like me that the reform process in Burma was designed to keep the military in power, the international community largely ignored our concerns. Meanwhile, many activists in Burma who spoke out against the military and demanded genuine democracyand thrown in prison.In late 2016, when the militarywhat the UN High Commissioner for Human Rightsas a \u201ctextbook example of ethnic cleansing\u201d against the Rohingya, a Muslim minority, it seemed like things might be reaching a breaking point.Finally, we thought, the international community would wake up to the atrocities being committed in Burma and come to our aid. Except this aid largely took the form ofa few Burmese military generals, freezing their assets and banning them from traveling to the US.It\u2019s no wonder Min Aung Hlaing, the head of the Burmese military, calculated that he could get away within February. The same day the coup began and Suu Kyi was arrested on trumped up charges, the military came for my father, who had most recently been released from prison in 2012. As a prominent democracy advocate, the military undoubtedly considered my father a troublemaker, and they arrested him before he could mobilize any anti-coup movement.Our deepest fear for America -- and the worldBut it wasn\u2019t just him. Many othersfrom their homes across Burma to prisons they may never leave. I am heartbroken for my father, but I cannot stop thinking about the other children now condemned to go through what I went through \u2013 not knowing where their parents are or when they will see them again.I am encouraged to see that when the coup began, the US governmentagainst the Burmese military by imposing targeted sanctions. But we need more. The US and the greater international community need to use all the tools at their disposal \u2013 diplomatic, humanitarian, economic and legal \u2013 to help people in Burma.Activists inside and outside the country have been calling for ato stop the flow of weapons to the military, additional sanctions onthat help fund the Burmese military, and support for efforts to report the military\u2019s violent actions to the International Criminal Court.Though I do not know when my father will be released from prison this time, or when I will be able to go home safely, I will continue to speak out against the military and amplify the voices of people in Burma who have been oppressed by the brutal military regime. Yes, the Burmese militarythis oppression andit\u2019s part of its fight against terrorism, but the truth is that we are being persecuted.Despite the ongoing use of violence, I refuse to believe the Burmese military has won. People like my father and many others like him continue to risk our lives for the sake of freedom. And with the aid of the US and the rest of the free world, we might just have a chance to help the people of Burma achieve true democracy."

But she didn\u2019t leave me her Tupperware.I have to admire those pristine pieces of my good friend Martha, whose motherleave her creamy white cake and pie keepers, in which a chocolate sheet cake or apple pie stays fresh \u2013 safe from moisture, heat, a sudden chill or hungry hands.These sturdy carriers allowed us to take a delicious Bing cherry Jell-O salad across the street or tea cakes clear across the country. And the secret of its appeal is that it held food that was homemade and not store-bought.If Tupperware has a down-side, it\u2019s the bulkiness: Entire kitchen cabinets have been devoted to its storage. And it has a tendency to get separated from its owner: Names are plastered on Tupperware containers like polo shirts packed off with the kids at summer camp. If a friend leaves you with the rest of the cupcakes, they\u2019re entrusting you with the return of their beloved plastic container.For 20 years now I\u2019ve worked with Martha on recipes for my cookbooks, but her main job is as a science and math teacher here in Nashville, and she puts her name on everything.Unlike less expensive supermarket knock-offs, you cherish Tupperware and collect it.Anne ByreWhen she drops off some cake layers for a photo shoot, on top is a post-it note reinforced with masking tape that reads, \u2018\u2019Martha\u2019s container.\u2019\u2019 It reminds me to get the Tupperware back to Martha pronto because like old photos or a charm bracelet, it\u2019s sentimental to her, too.Today there\u2019s worry 77-year-oldand might not recover. If you ask me, Tupperware may have planted the seeds of its own demise: It\u2019s not that it\u2019s plastic; it\u2019s that its products lasted too long. Like heirlooms, they were bequeathed from mother to daughter. And like a trusty Maytag washing machine of old, Tupperware never needed replacing.when Earl Tupper, a Massachusetts home inventor and chemist was inspired by how paint cans could seal tightly and thought the kitchen could use plastic containers that did the same thing.Tupper\u2019s products were sold through home parties, social events where sellers invited friends and neighbors to eat, drink, and buy Tupperware, and star sellers received minks, home appliances and vacations for their efforts.The timing was perfect. My mother\u2019s post World War II America was mobile and moving to the suburbs. They had seen their own parents pack food in shirt and shoe boxes and even store fruitcakes to mellow in the drawers of a dresser. To them, Tupperware must have been a refreshing change: a tidier, more stylish way to store food items as mundane as meatloaf or as chic as chiffon pie.And Tupperware, along with, allowed moveable feasts to begin. My family once drove from Nashville to Portland, Oregon with Tupperware when I was 12, and my father bought a camper to attach to the back of our Rambler station wagon.We slept at campgrounds along the way, and my mother assembled sandwiches for lunch, pulling the provisions from a cooler with all the makings \u2014 meat, cheese, pickles, tomatoes, and lettuce \u2014 stored separately in celery-green Tupperware boxes. I\u2019d give anything to have my mom\u2019s soft blue bowl with snap-on lid in which she placed Bibb lettuce leaves, first rinsed and carefully dried in paper towels, just waiting for scoops of tuna or chicken salad.Economists say Tupperware doesn\u2019t resonate with today\u2019s younger customers, but I beg to differ. Take a look at Etsy and you\u2019ll see. A set of six pastel vintage \u2018\u2019Millionaire\u2019\u2019 tumblers with iced tea spoons and lids that came off the factory line in 1947 can be found for $100. And fans\u00a0of \u201cThe Marvelous Mrs. Maisel\u201d have clamored to buy the same pastel nesting bowls that Midge Maisel sold at her Tupperware party in season 4.It\u2019s back! To celebrate the final season of The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel, premiering April 14, Tupperware launched its latest vintage collection. From vintage Thatsa Bowls and more-On eBay you can buy a vintage pale yellow \u201csunburst gold\u201d cake carrier from the 1970s for $10. Maybe they\u2019re being snatched up by prop stylists, or appealing to people like me who didn\u2019t inherit her mother\u2019s Tupperware, or resonate with a younger generation that values sustainability and reusing something from a previous generation.So even if Tupperware stops production, don\u2019t expect its allure to vanish. It speaks to a time when food was made at home and shared with other people, even if the recipes started with a box of cake mix or Jell-O. And unlike less expensive supermarket knock-offs, you cherish Tupperware and collect it.And \u2013 for those of us whose mothers didn\u2019t leave us their Tupperware \u2013 there is something irresistible about popping open the lid of our friends\u2019 bowls and peering inside to see what kale or potato salad, hummus or baba ghanoush, brownies or blondies, or other good stuff they\u2019ve brought from home to share.Today we have Ziploc bags, drive-thru breakfast sandwiches, and baking pans with snap-on plastic tops to facilitate eating on the road. We don\u2019t really need Tupperware any more, but that doesn\u2019t stop us from wanting it.Not unlike keeping track of matching socks in a pair, as long as we keep up with the bottom and the top of the Tupperware we\u2019ll hold onto these cherished pieces forever, until death do us part."

The views expressed in this commentary are his own. Viewon CNN.I was born in a Chinese reeducation camp, where my mother was detained in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, which many Uyghurs call East Turkistan. For most of my life, I tried to forget the horrific experiences my mother and I had during my early childhood. But it seems the past is repeating itself \u2013 and with a vengeance.When I was born, the Uyghur region \u2013 like the rest of China \u2013 was in the throes of Mao Zedong\u2019s. It was a period of totalitarian zeal: Almost anyone suspected of not being adequately communist was beaten, jailed or killed. Religious and ethnic minorities were particular targets.Mao\u2019s zealots, called the, came to the traditional Uyghur homeland to enforce the brutal policies of the tyrannical regime. The Red Guardsreligious texts, destroyed mosques, banned Uyghur-language books and ordered millions of Uyghurs \u2013 including my mother \u2013 into reeducation camps to be indoctrinated in Maoist doctrines and to be \u201creformed\u201d through hard labor.While arbitrary reeducation on a large scale experienced a lull following the end of the Cultural Revolution, forced labor programsa human rights concern in China in spite of the economic reforms of the following decades.Now, some half a century later, China is targeting the Uyghur population with a new fervor.  According to the US Department of Defense, Chinapossibly as many as 3 million Uyghurs in detention camps. Meanwhile, based on satellite imagery, CNN reports Chinatraditional Uyghur cemeteries. And, according to the accounts of several Uyghur women, it isan extensive forced sterilization program.Our generation will either renew democracy -- or lose it foreverHaving experienced the reality of living under this regime, and now watching with horror as these atrocities are visited on my Uyghur brothers and sisters, it\u2019s difficult for me to comprehend how any Western actor could push for greater dialogue or engagement with such a regime.How cheap are the lives of my people to the international community if it ignoresof the Chinese government\u2019s attempt to commit genocide against the Uyghurs? Democracies and nongovernmental organizations alike must do significantly more to support the Uyghur struggle \u2013 even if it comes with an inevitable backlash from the Chinese government.Since leaving China in 1995 to seek political freedom and pursue graduate education, I have made it my mission to speak out against the horrors perpetrated against the Uyghurs, despite the serious consequences I have had to pay. I have not seen my mother or father for more than 17 years. The Chinese authorities have prevented my ailing and aging parents from leaving to reunite with their American children and grandchildren. Though my parents have never been given a clear reason for this, I strongly believe it is because of my criticism of the Chinese government.As a lawyer, human rights advocate, and nowfor the US Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF), I have advocated for human rights and religious freedom in China and around the world for many years. And, in these capacities, I have seen real progress in raising awareness of the atrocities perpetrated in the Uyghur region. But to have any meaningful impact, the world\u2019s leading democracies must pursue a bolder strategy aimed squarely at hitting China where it hurts \u2013 weaponizing import bans and strategic investments.Appallingly, many of the products enjoyed by Western countries are made by interned Uyghurs in China. According to several reports, Uyghur forced labor contributes significantly to the world economy \u2013 particularlyand. In a liberal international order, there can be no room for forced labor.The US Senate has taken serious steps forward on this issue by passing the, which establishes broad import bans on products from the Uyghur region. The US House of Representatives, which passed an earlier version of the bill in 2020, must now move quickly to pass this bill, so that President Joe Biden can sign it into law.Our European partners \u2013 another enormous market for Chinese products \u2013 must follow suit, and the United States should encourage our allies to join us in rooting out this evil practice. While the European Union is currently craftingto address human rights violations within EU supply chains, it hasa strong enough indication that it will adopt broad import bans for products produced by Uyghur forced labor.Europe endured the worst of the horrors of Nazism, fascism and communism \u2013 and should understand the consequences of failing to act in the face of a regime that seeks to eradicate minority groups. If the EU is to have any credibility as a moral leader, it must ban the import of products from Xinjiang.Indeed, such bans, which go further than many of thealready in place, can go a long way toward mitigating the atrocious crimes that Beijing is committing in the Uyghur homeland. Consider some of the, which are already proving to be effective at chipping away at two things the Chinese party leadership cares most about \u2013 economic interests and public image.Chinese whistleblower exposes torture of Uyghur prisoners in CNN interviewBanning the import of agricultural products \u2013 such as cotton and tomatoes \u2013the supply chains for theandindustries. And the enforcement measures behind these sanctions have also created pressure points for US companies, forcing them to recognize thein China while also facing administrative, legal and reputational risks in the United States. In addition, public naming and shaming through the use of sanctions has sent a powerful message to Beijing that perpetrators of human rights abuses cannot remain anonymous.That\u2019s not to say that this is a risk-free proposition for the countries implementing such a ban. Italy is one of theof goods from Xinjiang, and it may be challenging for such a country to cut itself off from Xinjiang products, even if it would like to. That\u2019s why it\u2019s critical for powerful economies like the United States and other democracies to invest in viable alternatives to China\u2019s forced-labor products, thereby making it easier for countries to diversify their supply chains.This June, the US Senate passed the, which designates $250 billion to boost American scientific research, design and semiconductor manufacturing. The United States and its democratic partners should consider similar legislation to boost the manufacturing of products that have until now been dominated by companies operating with forced labor in Xinjiang.Both\u2019s and\u2019s administrations have labeled China\u2019s actions toward the Uyghurs as a genocide, and the,,andParliaments have concurred. State signatories to the United Nationsare obliged to take action to halt genocide when it occurs and punish the perpetrators. Yet so much more remains to be done to address the continuing horrors of Xinjiang.This cuts to the legal and moral core of the liberal international order. The dual strategy of import bans and domestic investment may not be a panacea, but it is undoubtedly a meaningful step in the right direction. After watching a lifetime of abuse by the Chinese regime, such actions give me at least a glimmer of hope that Uyghur lives mean more to the international community than platitudes."

        "link": "https://edition.cnn.com/2023/04/25/opinions/dna-structure-discovery-rosalind-franklin-levitt-scn/index.html",
        "text": "Seventy years ago on Tuesday,andrevealed the structure of DNA \u2014 the genetic instructions in all living things \u2014 in the journal.\u00adOne of the most important milestones in modern science, does April 25 also mark the date of an intellectual heist? As, a third person contributed to the discovery \u2014 the chemist.In 1968, Watson\u00a0wrotein his tell-all book, \u201c,\u201d that he and Crickas part of their effort to find DNA\u2019s structure. Since then, many have suspected that she was robbed. Was she?Was this a case of blatant intellectual theft or legitimate opportunity seized?The first accusation is that Watson was improperly shown Franklin\u2019s famed, a remarkably sharp image of DNA made by. It is possible to assign blame here, yet the situation was quite complex.Franklin, a brilliant self-assured scientist at King\u2019s College London, had taken the photograph months earlier with her graduate student Raymond Gosling. They had delayed analyzing it while they worked on other images.In January 1953, Franklin was getting ready to leave King\u2019s College. Her colleaguewas independently pursuing DNA\u2019s structure, and she had grown so miserable there, largely because of their rivalry, that she had found a position at another university. As she was told she couldn\u2019t take her research with her, Franklin asked Gosling to give her photograph to Wilkins, who would take over the DNA work.Fifty miles away at the University of Cambridge, an ambitious duo, the biologist Watson and the physicist Crick, were intently following her progress. They, too, were eager to find the structure of DNA. A year earlier, Watson had traveled to King\u2019s College to attend a lecture Franklin gave to her department.Using data that she had presented, Watson and Crick had tried building a model to puzzle out DNA\u2019s structure. But after Franklin\u2019s department chair lodged an outraged protest, Watson and Crick\u2019s own department chair, William Bragg, ordered them to stop. He was chagrined that his staff was poaching on the unpublished data of a fellow British lab.About a year later, Watson and Crick learned that in an as-yet-unpublished paper, the brilliant California Institute of Technology chemist, had proposed a structure for DNA. Although they saw that his work was obviously wrong, they feared that Pauling would soon find the correct one. So, Watson traveled to London to urge Franklin to begin building a model to work out DNA\u2019s structure before Pauling did.Franklin, a careful experimentalist, thought model building too speculative. Aggravated by Watson\u2019s insistence, she rebuffed him. On his way out, Watson met Wilkins \u2014 Franklin\u2019s rival.Wilkins believed that Franklin had been recruited as his assistant when she arrived at King\u2019s,but that was not what she had been told. Add to that a, and their relationship went downhill fast.Now, Wilkins was exasperated because, although Franklin had takenimage nine months earlier, he had only seen it a few days before. So, when Wilkins met Watson, he vented his frustration; he displayed Franklin\u2019s photo to show how much she had been withholding from him.As soon as Watson saw the photograph, he recalled in \u201cThe Double Helix,\u201d his pulse began to race. An unmistakable X pattern instantly revealed that DNA must have the shape of a helix, something that he, Crick and Wilkins had suspected but had not confirmed. That meant DNA\u2019s precise structure might be simple enough to find by model building.Watson did get a little data from the image, but more importantly, he was suddenly convinced that he should race back to Cambridge and try working out DNA\u2019s structure as fast as possible. Watson and Crick swiftly received permission from their department head to begin model building again. Their department chair didn\u2019t want an American \u2014 Pauling \u2014 to beat them.Was it unethical for Wilkins to show Franklin\u2019s photo to Watson and Crick? Franklin had not left King\u2019s College yet. For Wilkins to share the image while\u00a0Franklin\u00a0was still working on DNA was wrong.\u00a0Wilkins may have even been asked not to use the photograph until she left. However,, he didn\u2019t think the photo contained any bombshells. Wilkins did it out of pique, not with the intention of giving Watson information that he could use to scoop both Franklin and Wilkins.In 2021,that he had pressed Watson a few years ago on the issue of Franklin\u2019s permission. \u201cWatson demurred that since Franklin was \u2018only\u2019 a postdoctoral fellow, the King\u2019s College biophysics lab had proprietary rights over all her DNA data. As such, she was required to turn it all over to Wilkins in anticipation of her exit (from King\u2019s College). \u2026 Hence, Watson explained, Wilkins was perfectly entitled to show them to anyone he pleased.\u201dNASA mission detects first seismic waves traveling through the center of MarsThe second accusation, one that, is that Watson and Crick gained access to Franklin\u2019s data in an underhanded way soon after they began model building. Her data came their way because Franklin and Wilkins\u2019 lab at King\u2019s College and Watson and Crick\u2019s lab at the University of Cambridge were supported by the same funderThe funder asked Franklin, like others, to submit an interim report on her research, and it was shared with Crick\u2019s doctoral adviser,.Without asking Franklin\u2019s permission, Perutz gave the report to Crick. This is where ethical opinions differ. In his defense, Crick\u2019s adviser pointed out that the report was not labeled confidential. In fact, Franklin had already presented the same data in the departmental lecture that Watson had attended a year earlier. Had Crick gone to the lecture, he would have learned of it then.On the other hand, Franklin\u2019s data was unpublished, and she was still interpreting it; no one asked her permission to use it. As Crick\u2019s adviser, Perutz later wrote that\u00a0he\u00a0was \u201c.\u201dIn the Nature commentary, historians Matthew Cobb and Nathaniel Comfort argue that a letter they uncovered, which a colleague of Franklin\u2019s wrote to Crick,implies that Franklin might not have objected to her data being passed on as part of \u201cinformal scientific exchange.\u201d That is certainly possible.The 1953 letter suggests that Franklin expected that Crick\u2019s thesis adviser might discuss her research with Crick. However, Franklin\u2019s sister believed that Franklin, and Franklin\u2019s department chair certainly thought that even if the report was not labeled confidential, it was improper to have shared the data. We\u2019ll never know what Franklin would have thought, but it\u2019s unlikely.That was the turning point. When Crick saw Franklin\u2019s data, he realized something that Franklin had not. DNA\u2019s structure waswith\u00a0the bases A, T, C and G that carry the genetic informationattached to each backbone facing in opposite directions, like two staircases, one with stairs going up and the other with stairs going down. It was a crucial insight that Crick and Watson needed.Was it wrong for Crick to use the data? I asked one of Franklin\u2019s best friends, the,\u00a0in 2020, a year before his death. \u201cOpportunities were presented,\u201d he said, \u201cand he didn\u2019t turn his back on them. Was it immoral? It is like business with. If you get some useful information and you can use it to your advantage, what is the right thing to do?\u201dFor Watson, the fact that \u201cthe report was never marked \u2018confidential\u2019 \u201d meant there was nothing underhanded about it.What is clearly wrong is that Watson and Crick gave Franklin almost no credit. In their paper, they acknowledged her in one line, \u201cWe have also been stimulated by a knowledge of the general nature of the unpublished experimental results and ideas of Dr. M. H. F. Wilkins, Dr. R. E. Franklin and their co-workers at King\u2019s College, London.\u201dWatson and Crick could not have succeeded without Franklin\u2019s data. Why did they not give her more credit?Opinion: The ocean's 'blue carbon' can be our secret weapon in fighting climate changeWas Franklin robbed? Yes. It\u2019s clear that her data was passed on without her knowledge, and she was given insufficient credit for it. That wasn\u2019t proper then, and it\u2019s not now.Remarkably, Franklin didn\u2019t let her loss to Watson and Crick derail her. She was already moving on to another lab in London. There she made important contributions to understanding, some with the collaboration of Caspar, a young X-ray crystallographer. \u201cI never heard her reminiscing about things from the past,\u201d Caspar recalled. \u201cShe was always looking ahead to the future.\u201dWe\u2019ll never know what she would have thought since Franklin died\u00a0in 1958. She had grown quite close to Crick and his wife in the last years of her life. Yet she probably never learned how much of her data he and Watson had used. In 1962, four years after her death, Watson, Crick and Wilkinsfor their discovery., as she was no longer alive.In yet another twist, Cobb and Comfort have uncovered a draft of an article for Time magazine written in 1953, shortly after the discovery. It describes two scientific teams \u2014 Watson and Crick at the University of Cambridge and Franklin and Wilkins at King\u2019s College \u2014 that worked independently but \u201clinked up, confirming each other\u2019s work from time to time, or wrestling over a common problem.\u201dThat does not acknowledge the rampant sexism Franklin experienced, nor does it acknowledge how much was done behind her back. But as Cobb and Comfort point out, the Time story would have presented a different picture of Franklin. Rather than being portrayed as a wronged victim, she would have been seen as an important member of the team that discovered the structure of DNA.The Time piece was never published, so few heard of Franklin or knew of her contribution until15 years later when Watson published his book.enraged her friends. Crick was furious for an additional reason. \u201cFrancis was aghast,\u201d Caspar said. \u201cI think because it was so embarrassing that Jim had given away in the book that he and Francis had managed to get access to Rosalind\u2019s data behind her back. It led to a temporary breakup of their friendship.\u201dWatson and Crick\u2019s Nature paper buried Franklin\u2019s contribution, but Watson\u2019s unapologetic book revealed\u00a0that they had relied on much more of her work than they initially acknowledged.\u00a0It was only then that the world learned how much Watson and Crick had relied on Franklin\u2019s work to find the structure of DNA."

        "link": "https://edition.cnn.com/2023/04/26/opinions/harry-belafonte-legacy-entertainment-activism-seymour/index.html",
        "text": "Editor\u2019s Note:No one could have blamed Harry Belafonte if at certain points in his life he chose to remain outside of history rather than deep within its contours, much like Ralph Ellison\u2019s protagonist in \u201cInvisible Man,\u201d who looked underground for an escape from history\u2019s demands, making himself even more invisible than he was before.But history, as it often does, had other ideas for Belafonte,April 25 at 96, having lived a long, full life as both entertainer and activist. That was the role history had chosen for him. The social and political convulsions of the mid-20th\u00a0century made fulfilling that destiny both easier and harder for this New York City-born son of Caribbean parents as he came into adulthood at the pre-dawn of the civil rights movement \u2013 a movement whose aspirations he would embody and whose revolutionary energies he would propel.Maintaining that balance between his twin obligations to show business and to social change may have been, by itself, Belafonte\u2019s most extraordinary achievement. The times he lived in paved a smoother way for him than the one faced by his mentor and hero. At about the time Belafonte had emerged in the 1950s as both screen actor and recording star, Robeson, himself a film actor and singer of comparable fame and influence, was beingfor his outspokenness for civil rights and against US foreign policy.After years of political persecution, Robeson struggled with depression and withdrew from public life, but Belafonte carried on Robeson\u2019s crusade on roughly the same terms Robeson had defined for himself: as artist and insurgent. Belafonte marched in demonstrations. He conducted, supported and headlined fundraisers for civil rights activists facing physical peril down South, and in 1963, waspressing then-Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy to do more for those activists.Harry Belafonte, activist and entertainer with a \u2018rebel heart,\u2019 dies at 96On the other hand, there was, relatively speaking, only so much Belafonte could do on the entertainment side. With his striking good looks and strapping physical presence, Belafonte could have and should have been the first Black romantic movie lead. But as film historian Donald Bogle noted, Belafonte \u201cnever seemed at ease with romantic roles; nor did the film industry seem at ease at casting him in such.\u201d Though he and Dorothy Dandridge in 1954\u2019s \u201c\u201d made as beautiful a pair of star-crossed lovers as any in motion picture history, Belafonte seemed to check his rawer impulses while Dandridge\u2019s mercurial temperament seemed to blaze, unfettered.Belafonte\u2019s own passion and fire, which was always evident both in his live musical performances of calypso, folk and pop music and in his activism, seemed oddly, even awkwardly contained on screen. Much likeSidney Poitier, Belafonte seemed to be testing and gently pressing against the boundaries of what he was permitted to do in front of cameras, especially with White women. One remembers, with retroactive fury, the outraged reaction from TV audiences in 1968 when during a television special, British pop star Petula Clark and Belafonteduring a singing duet.In the end, it didn\u2019t matter. By that time, history had conferred upon Belafonte such moral authority from his activism,as confidante and aide to the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., who\u2019d been assassinated that same year.\u00a0Here, as elsewhere in Belafonte\u2019s life, the activism and the entertainment sides of his public life worked in tandem to buttress, offset and enhance the other.And in a gratifying sense, the push-pull of history\u2019s demands worked in Belafonte\u2019s favor as a screen actor., there were no more demands on Belafonte\u2019s time to be a romantic star \u2013 and so he kept up the pressure on social change (and on other Black celebrities to contribute more of their time to such crusades) while becoming, on-screen, a gifted character actor. He provided comic relief and idiosyncratic turns in Poitier-directed features, such as 1972\u2019s \u201cBuck and the Preacher\u201d and 1974\u2019s \u201cUptown Saturday Night.\u201d Then, in a remarkable late-career triumph, he was the mordantly dry-witted 1930s gangster Seldom Seen in Robert Altman\u2019s 1996 period musical, \u201cKansas City\u201d \u2013 for which Belafontethe New York Film Critics Circle award for Best Supporting Actor.One suspects, strongly, that being on the front lines of social change while receding to supporting roles on screen was, at last, a perfect balance for Belafonte. History can, at times, bestow the kindest fates to those who deserve it most."

It is an astonishing reversal in both political parties. For decades, ambitious politicians tried to outdo each other with \u201clock \u2018em up\u201d policies and \u201ctough-on-crime\u201d rhetoric.This dynamic accelerated after George H.W.

Incarceration fatigue opened the door toabout crime prevention that address underlying causes \u2013 like mental health, drugs, trauma, etc. And so leaders beganto create specialty courts \u2013 veterans courts, drug courts, mental health courts \u2013 across the country.The television series, \u201cOrange is the New Black,\u201d brought binge-watching Americans inside the lives of women living behind bars.

And in recent years, household names like Common, John Legend, Alicia Keys andhave become outspoken advocates.This wave of popular media pushed into mainstream living rooms and reached beyond the pool of those who once paid attention to the incarceration system. It is now common knowledge that the United States, shamefully, has thein the world.Many people assume that Democrats always opposed mass incarceration. That is a myth.

The deep blue state of California just recently began to dig itself out of an incarceration crisis that resulted in the construction ofbut only one university in the past generation. And the national Democratic Party\u2019s platform carefully excluded any reference to criminal justice reform.So, what changed? Many things \u2013 from #BlackLivesMatter to the.Seeing African American communities devastated by decades of overpolicing and excessive incarceration, a new generation of black activists rebelled. Starting in 2013, theythat Democrats address head-on the issues of racist police abuse and racial bias in the justice system. Their passion gave more political room for traditional civil rights and civil liberties organizations to accelerate their own longstanding reform efforts.Klobuchar: On criminal justice reform, it's time for a second stepTheir grass-roots protests also gave Obama a greater impetus and opportunity to champion criminal justice reform. He took full advantage \u2013to close to 2,000 inmates, pushing hard forand even becoming the first-ever sitting US president to. His attorneys general, Eric Holder and Loretta Lynch, reshaped the Department of Justice \u2013 with a focus on. And, in 2016, Hillary Clinton\u2019s platform includedcalling for criminal justice reform \u2013 an issuehad touched for decades.Pushed past the breaking point, the incarceration generation rose up andthat Democrats speak out boldly against the racial injustice in the system. Today, all Democrats echo their call. The protests that started in 2013 have yielded a Democratic Party today that is more firmly grounded in its core ideals of racial, gender and social justice.But Democrats also know the Republicans aren\u2019t going to \u201cWillie Horton\u201d them, since so many conservatives are also embracing the cause.Many on the left doubt the sincerity of criminal justice reformers on the right. They can\u2019t believe that Republicans would truly care about a \u201cracial justice\u201d issue. But the truth is that Republicansto oppose the incarceration industry.Republicans care a lot about public safety. But the \u201ctough on crime\u201d system made many communities. Today, many conservatives want anthat focuses on reducing crime. They\u2019ve returned to principles thaton the right as they joined the fight for reform.One such principle is the need for fiscal prudence with taxpayer dollars and less government waste. Fiscal conservatives balk at theof mass incarceration. That\u2019sRepublican governors, likeand, passed reform bills that saved millions of dollars and (in Texas) even closed several prisons, all while bringing the crime rate down.Koch network: We're rejecting partisanship in favor of problem solvingAnother conservative principle is the desire for transparency, accountability and limits on government overreach.especially don\u2019t want the government to have too much power over individual lives. The Koch brothers fall into this category. So do US Sens. Mike Lee and Rand Paul and advocacy groups like FreedomWorks.Yet another conservative value is the faith-based belief in human dignity. Religious conservatives, including Newt Gingrich,the present system leaves no real opportunity for second chances or personal redemption. When he was the Republican governor of Mississippi, Phil Bryant explicitly cited his Christian faith as the source of his passion for.Black pro-Trump conservatives like Candace Owens and Katrina Pierson are working to return a pro-Lincoln, pro-freedom ethic inside the GOP on this issue.In theory, of course, all conservatives should oppose a big, failed government bureaucracy that produces bad outcomes while eating up taxpayer dollars. America\u2019s massive prison industry today represents a classic case of this phenomenon. And more and more Republicans \u2013 fromtoto\u2013 are willing to say so.Then there is the most surprising plot twist of all: Trump\u2019s decision to release.  The world watched as Johnson, a 63-year-old grandmother who had been sentenced to die in prison, ran across the road into her family\u2019s arms. We began to hear the President shift fromas \u201ctough on crime\u201dthat he\u2019s tough but fair and recognizing the disproportionate sentencing in the justice system. Surrounded by law enforcement, faith leaders, Republican members and even several Democrats, Trump then endorsedto the First Step Act, which he signed into law later that year.Because many red state governors, this Republican President could engage on criminal justice reform without risking his base. More importantly, key people in Trump\u2019s inner circle \u2013 including his son-in-law,\u2013 were strong allies. This opened the door for(on the left and right) to make repeated visits to the White House, sharing their experiences with senior officials of how the existing system failed them.People on both sides of the aisle should be glad that Trump decided to adopt the cause \u2013 and not crush it. Criminal justice reform could have fallen into a divisive stalemate like guns, climate or immigration. Instead, Trump\u2019s decision to embrace criminal justice reform has set Republicans free to work with Democrats. That\u2019s a good thing for both parties \u2013 and a very good thing for the people suffering behind bars.I\u2019ve spent time in red states, blue states, Appalachia and urban neighborhoods. I see the same problems everywhere: generational poverty, addiction, underperforming schools, lack of access to mental health services and a broken criminal justice system. Neither party has been able to make a real dent in these problems facing low-income communities.The sad truth is that Republicans get a lot of votes from poor, rural communities \u2013 but have failed to sufficiently improve conditions or expand opportunity there. Democrats get a lot of votes from poor, urban communities \u2013 but we have failed to sufficiently improve conditions or expand opportunity there. That\u2019s why I came to believe in bottom-up bipartisanship \u2013 centered on addressing the pain of the people at the bottom in both parties.However, here is what I know: Change is possible \u2013 and criminal justice reform is evidence of that. As recently as 2014, the idea of \u201cbipartisan criminal justice reform\u201d was an oxymoron. Now it is almost a clich\u00e9. And, symbolically, Alice Johnson has replaced Willie Horton as the iconic image of a formerly incarcerated person.When I started 25 years ago, politicians in both parties promised to lock up more people, treat them more harshly and keep them behind bars longer. Today, leaders in both parties say we should lock up fewer people, help them transform their lives and send them home better, not bitter.Criminal justice reform is renewing the right\u2019s dedication to individual \u201cliberty\u201d and deepening the left\u2019s commitment to social \u201cjustice.\u201d As a result, we still have a chance to build a country with \u201cliberty\u201d and \u201cjustice\u201d for all."

For many, including myself, Bed Bath & Beyond was just that.Learning that the chainon Sunday and would be shuttering for good made me \u2014 and I imagine others \u2014 reflect on how the chain and, of course,played a role in our lives.Bed Bath & Beyond CEO Sue Gove put it well in aSunday when announcing the end of the line for the company: \u201cMillions of customers have trusted us through the most important milestones in their lives \u2014 from going to college to getting married, settling into a new home to having a baby.\u201d For countless Americans, Bed Bath & Beyond was there at those key moments.The chainwith one store in\u2014 where all good things begin \u2014 in 1971 by founders Warren Eisenberg and Leonard Feinstein. That first store was named Bed \u2018n Bath, but as it grew, the name changed in 1987 to Bed Bath & Beyond. At its peak in 2018, Bed Bath & Beyondto more than 1,500 stores in North America.This is when your blue Bed Bath & Beyond coupons will stop workingBed Bath & Beyond seemed to be everywhere \u2014 as did itsthat were like a currency of their own. Before emails sent these coupons, you had to obtain them at the store or via mail. And when you did, it was time to shop.The Bed Bath & Beyond superstores sold just about everything. You could buy scented candles on the first floor, wall art on the second floor and odd little tchotchkes in the clearance section on the lower level (depending on the layout of the store near you.) If Bed Bath & Beyond didn\u2019t have it, then you didn\u2019t need it!Living in Manhattan for almost 20 years, I became a regular at the nearby store \u2014 almost like a Bed Bath & Beyond version of Norm from \u201cCheers.\u201d That store helped me make the transition to three different living spaces.There are still curtains hanging over my windows, a salad bowl used daily and numerous other items that came from treks to the local store. And on countless Black Fridays, I was at the store at 7 a.m. when it opened, offering extra savings. I would stock up on enough deodorant and face soap to last hopefully to the following Black Friday.There\u2019s something else about the closing of Bed Bath & Beyond. Given its 50-plus-year existence, the chain likely conjures up memories of shopping with loved ones we have since lost.Why brick-and-mortar is still the future of retailI was bummed whenclosed in the mid-2000s, but it was not a store I would go to with my late father. But Bed Bath & Beyond was such a store since there was one in my hometown in New Jersey. And with its closing come\u00a0memories of shopping there with him or for him \u2014 such as buying a practical dad-type birthday gift.The older we get the more the closing of certain places trigger these bittersweet memories. It could be a local restaurant your family gathered at for holidays or a professional sports stadium that you went to with a parent that was torn down and replaced by a corporate-sponsored one.However, my mourning for Bed Bath & Beyond came sooner than this weekend since myclosed in December 2020 as hard times started hitting the chain. Soon, though, that disappointment was offset by the daily nonstop emails from the retail chain offering online the 20%-off coupon once only obtainable in person.Yet the bad news for Bed Bath & Beyond only got worse over theas consumers started increasingly using Amazon and other online platforms. Finally, on Sunday morning those emails I received that bore a subject line of \u201cOpen for your 20% coupon!\u201d or \u201cUp to 50% off\u201d had been replaced with one that read, \u201cImportant Update from Bed Bath & Beyond Inc.\u201dThat\u00a0heralded the unfortunate news that \u201cearlier today, Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. filed for voluntary Chapter 11 protection\u201d and an explanation that the chain would be closing.For those seeking to use their 20%-off coupon one \u2014 or two \u2014 last times, you have until TuesdayBed Bath & Beyond. (I made a purchase Sunday morning using my coupon.) In time, Bed Bath & Beyond will simply be a memory like other well-known and now\u2014 from Blockbuster to Sharper Image. But the memories of the way Bed Bath & Beyond helped fill our lives \u2014 and literally our homes \u2014 will long remain."

Their denunciations crowd out common sense and basic kindness, leading to frustration, alienation and even more polarization.The good news is that we\u2019re starting to see a principled pushback against these extremes. It\u2019s coming from campus leaders \u2013 most recently at Cornell and Stanford \u2013 who are making a case for viewpoint diversity and civility, rooted in liberal values. They offer a welcome way to de-escalate the woke wars.Yes, the far-right has pumped up \u201cwoke panic\u201d into a cottage industry, perfect for fear-mongering, fundraising and playing to the base.\u00a0But it\u2019s a mistake to dismiss this\u00a0all as a phantom menace.noted in a recent Boston Globe op-ed that, according to the, from 2014 to 2022 there wereto punish scholars \u201cfor expression that is, or in public contexts would be, protected by the First Amendment.\u201d Of these, 60% resulted in actual sanctions, \u201cincluding 114 incidents of censorship and 156 firings (44 of them tenured professors) \u2014 more than during the McCarthy era.\u201dThe American public also thinks the problem is real. Eighty-four percent of Americans say that beingis a serious problem in our country, according to a 2022 Siena College/New York Times poll. Over half (55%) of the respondents said they held back from expressing opinions because they were afraid of retaliation, harsh criticism or conflict. Most concerning,\u00a030% of Americans believe that \u201csometimes you have to shut down speech that is anti-democratic, bigoted or simply untrue.\u201d Intolerance in the name of inclusion is a contradiction, and a very slippery slope.But there are signs that the sensible center is taking a stand. Take two recent actions at Cornell and Stanford, where campus administrators applied liberal principles to student-led culture clashes. The results were refreshing.Opinion: What history reveals about the DeSantis playbookIn the case of Cornell, the moment of clarity came when thein March to put trigger warnings on the school\u2019s syllabus for any course containing content that might be viewed as \u201ctraumatic.\u201d This would have codified the.Butswiftly vetoed it \u2013 and then published an open letter with the school provost explaining why.

Consistent application of liberal values provides the off-ramp from escalation that we need right now.

Viewon CNN.Wordle, the word-guessing game that swamped social media feeds at the start of 2022, has now passed from fad to fixture: On Monday, The New York Times announced it had paid \u201cin the low seven figures\u201d. Soon Wordle will join the stable of popular online games offered behind the Times paywall (though the paper says Wordle will \u201cinitially\u201d remain free for users).For such a simple game \u2013 players have six attempts to guess a five-letter word \u2013 the story of the Wordle craze is surprisingly complex. There is the business story about the Times, a newspaper whose digital-subscription revenues have soared not only because of its journalism but because of its array of online games and recipes. There\u2019s theabout the game\u2019s rapid spread, aided by the (to many, annoying) ease with which players can share their results in a pleasingly graphic form to Twitter and Instagram. But there\u2019s also a cultural story: Wordle, like most games that capture the public imagination, is overwritten with some of the key anxieties and tensions of our time.Wordle is, first and foremost, a pandemic story. Toldin the pages of the Times, the game\u2019s creator, Josh Wardle, developed it for his partner, an avid word-game player. That idea \u2013 that a game created as an act of love soon won the hearts of millions of players \u2013 is a pleasantly wholesome respite from the start of a grindingly unpleasant new year (thanks, Omicron). It also allows a moment of shared experience at a time when, in parts of the country, in-person events have been canceled.Yet unlike the lose-yourself-for-hours games that dominated the early pandemic months, fromto the omnipresent Animal Crossing, Wordle meets the needs of a mostly open, still-chaotic country that has refilled its empty calendars but still faces the disruptions of constant testing and unexpected closures and quarantines. A game takes only a few minutes to play, and the platform offers only one game a day. Once you\u2019re done, you\u2019re done \u2013 the perfect late-pandemic pastime.New York Times buys viral sensation online game WordleIts acquisition by the Times, however, highlights another social aspect of playing Wordle. Sharing Wordle scores is not just an act of community but, in some ways, a boast of intelligence. Solving a Wordle with just two or three guesses feels not lucky but savvy: a combination of intellect and cleverness. Its introduction into the Times universe alongside the newspaper\u2019s storied crossword puzzles and word-nerd Spelling Bee game only underscores that quality.The virtue of playing word games comes not only from the atmosphere of intellect around the games, but also the belief that such activities help keep aging brains nimble, improving memory and warding off dementia (the scientific evidence on this). It is the same virtue-washing that happens when someone sits down with a glass of red wine and a square of dark chocolate while murmuring that the after-dinner indulgence is an effort to maintain heart health.But that too is a product of our cultural moment. When crosswords were first introduced to the United States in the 1920s, they were laden with the anxieties of that time: worries that they were mindless entertainment on the level of comic strips, distractions from more serious endeavors. The New York Times, in fact,in its pages because the game was, as a 1924 editorial put it, \u201ca primitive sort of mental exercise.\u201d It only reversed course after the United States entered World War II and New York began dealing with regular blackouts. Times editors decided that New Yorkers had earned a distraction from the heavy news found in the rest of the paper.Nor were crosswords the last gaming trend to spark hand-wringing from people worried that players were ignoring more virtuous pursuits. Video games, first in arcades and then at home, regularly drew charges that they. Those fears intensified when put alongside concerns about guns and violence, culminating inthat led to a new rating system developed by the gaming industry.Worries about the anti-intellectualism of gaming, a mainstay of video game criticisms since the mid-20th century, have in recent years broadened to include anxieties about all screen time, whether it\u2019s an interactive game, Twitter-scrolling, watching YouTube videos or TikToks or texting with friends.It\u2019s not surprising, then, when games seem to require a new level of justification: Pok\u00e9mon Go and Wii weren\u2019t just games, they were fitness regimes. Wordle, Spelling Bee and all those other word games keep brains sharp. Even more mindless pursuits like Candy Crush could be written down as a few moments of self-care.And while that\u2019s not the worst way to think about the games we play, it does betray a puritanical streak in American culture: a sense that pleasure must be qualified, that fun must be intellectualized, that vice must be transformed into virtue. But as we enter the third year of the pandemic, with all the tragedy and monotony and sacrifice it has brought, now seems like the right time to insist that pleasure is a virtue in and of itself."

View moreon CNN.On November 14, 2016, \u201cTucker Carlson Tonight\u201d\u00a0made its debut. The timing was significant: Fox Newsits shows and contributors for months, as it sought to hone in on a lineup that matched its audience\u2019s preference for Donald Trump,\u00a0who had won the presidency only days earlier.Carlson delivered. His show became a clearinghouse for populist rage, a pipeline for far-right content and the most mainstream voice of, which argued that White people were being purposefully replaced by non-white populations. The right-wing, America-First themes that defined Carlson\u2019s broadcasts made him the voice of the MAGA base in during the Trump era \u2014 and by 2020, it made his show.So his surprise ouster from Fox News this week, coming just a week aftera $787 million defamation suit with Dominion Voting Systems, raises serious questions about where exactly Fox News goes from here \u2014 and whether it can bring its conservative audience with it.The network has been in crisis mode for more than two years. It adjusted haltingly to the Trump era, as executives realized its audience seemed more loyal to him than to Fox News. But by the time of Trump\u2019s inauguration, Fox News had found its footing: it would become the mouthpiece of the administration. The morning show Fox & Friends regularly gave airtime to rambling calls from the new president; primetime host Sean Hannity\u00a0talked\u00a0with the president.Tucker Carlson\u2019s departure won\u2019t change Fox NewsWhile Hannity became the voice of the White House, Carlson became the voice of the base. He positioned himself as a populist scrapper \u2014 never mind that he\u2019swith a penchant for bowties \u2014 and began warning his audience that liberal elites were coming for their gun, their jobs and their children.From his position as the voice of the base, Carlson could criticize Trump when he stepped out of line for things like his. Carlson was also able to survivethat his head writer regularly posted racist comments on White-nationalist web sites\u00a0\u2014 and even attack corporate media,\u00a0despite his role as anchor for the nation\u2019s most popular cable-news corporation.As the MAGA-whisperer on Fox News, Tucker was the network\u2019s tentpole for the entire Trump era. When the network began bleeding listeners after calling the 2020 presidential election for Joe Biden, Carlson helped lure them back with conspiratorial content about the attack on the Capitol. In his propaganda documentary \u201cPatriot Purge,\u201d Carlsonthat the Capitol assault had been carried out by \u201cagents provocateur,\u201d and that those who had been arrested were \u201cpolitical prisoners.\u201d His MAGA-friendly conspiracies paved Fox News\u2019s path back to credibility with its audience.Yet while the audience rebounded, the troubles at Fox News continued to mount. Having doubled-down on election lies after the 2020 race, the network faced defamation suits from Dominion Voting Systems and Smartmatic, two voting-machine manufacturers central to the 2020 election conspiracies.The Dominion suit,for $787 million, came with reams of discovery that showed just how beholden Fox News is to the beliefs of its audience. Executives, anchors and hosts all panicked after the 2020 election, worried that, by reporting the news, they had driven away their viewers. Given a choice between alienating its audience and reporting the news, Fox chose the ratings.Having made that choice, Fox News now finds itself in a corner once again. Back in the Obama years, the channel benefited from its reputation as a legitimate news organization. When the Obama administration dismissed Fox as propaganda, journalists. That ended during the Trump years, as Fox\u00a0largely\u00a0shed its pretense of news coverage to serve the Trump administration.Where Fox once competed with CNN and MSNBC for viewers, it increasingly found itself fighting for dominance with networks like Newsmax and web sites like Breitbart, outlets that were far less constrained by a pretense to journalism and willing to go much further with overtly racist content and wild conspiracy theories. Carlson was Fox\u2019s leading fighter on that battlefield. With him gone, the network will have to find a new way to secure its audience \u2014 or risk losing even more ground to competitors on the right."

Frustrated by this progress, social conservatives in the state created an organization called.Worried about more localities passing anti-discrimination laws, which it saw as endorsing non-Christian values, the group came up with a bold strategy: Start a ballot initiative to amend the Colorado\u00a0Constitution to prohibit state and local government bodies from passing more. The question was: How would it convince voters, who were increasingly tolerant of gay people, to support it?Opinion: If you say you\u2019re a trans ally, this is what you have to doThe group developed two primary tactics it thought would appeal to different types of voters. The first was a more palatable \u201cfairness\u201d argument. Itthat anti-discrimination laws would give gay people preferential or \u201cbetter\u201d treatment than straight people. It ran with\u201cequal rights, not special rights.\u201dThe second was a bit more grotesque \u2014 reverting to age-old accusations that gay people were sexual predators and \u201cgroomers\u201d who posed a risk to children. The strategies worked, and what was known as.Colorado for Family Values used the fairness argument in the 1990s toamong some Americans regarding affirmative action.\u00a0Civil rights groups had made great progress, and some Americans feared that affirmative action would help racial minorities at the expense of White people. The anti-discrimination laws in Colorado didn\u2019t take anything away from straight people, but that didn\u2019t matter.We\u2019re seeing the same repackaged rhetoric play out in transgender sports bans. Social conservatives have argued that these bans are about fairness and paint transgender people as taking things away from cisgender people.In the court case, the socially conservative legal advocacy groupworked on a lawsuit to sue\u00a0the Connecticut Interscholastic Athletic Conference, asserting that two transgender girls competing in the state\u2019s track meets were infringing upon the rights of cisgender track athletes.\u00a0(Is it a coincidence that the transgender athletes they targeted were African American? It\u2019s unclear, but there\u2019son racial lines, based on presumed biological advantages.)\u00a0The plaintiffs essentially argued that if transgender athletes could compete, cisgender girls couldn\u2019t win, and this was unfair.Once again, the facts didn\u2019t matter. Transgender people. In fact, two days after the lawsuit was filed,from that lawsuit\u00a0won the Class S 55-meter dash title\u00a0at a state championship race, and thethe lower court\u2019s dismissal of the case.Opinion: I\u2019m a trans Tennessean. This new law will hurt so many of usTrans people are underrepresented in sports titles, and many politicians proposing these lawsin their states. At most, they\u2019ll find a single successful trans athlete such as, working on the presumption that sports are only fair if trans people.The sports bills aren\u2019t really about fairness. They\u2019re about capitalizing on an electorate that social conservatives know they can rile up with disingenuous arguments and the notion that members of minority groups are taking things away from them.We\u2019ve also seen a resurgence in social conservatives labeling LGBTQ people as dangerous to children. When advocating for Colorado\u2019s Amendment 2 in the 1990s,saying that \u201csexual molestation of children is a large part of many homosexuals\u2019 lifestyle.\u201d Things are much the same today.\u00a0US Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greenethat \u201cDemocrats are the party of pedophiles,\u201d a comment she doubled down on inon CBS\u2019 \u201c60 Minutes.\u201dSome conservatives have turned this rhetoric into public policy,to force transgender people to use bathrooms of their sex assigned at birth, suggesting that otherwise sexual assault rates in bathrooms will rise. Though research shows that such policies are linked to transgender youth facingI worry thatwon\u2019t win out.In the 1990s, Colorado for Family Values won in large part because it had carefully crafted, emotionally inflammatory rhetoric, and its opponents didn\u2019t. It didn\u2019t matter that facts weren\u2019t on the group\u2019s side. The same is true today.In recent years, this rhetoric has been most effectively applied to attacks on gender-affirming medical care. Some conservatives have labeled it \u201c\u201d and in some instances \u201c\u201d despite endorsements.Those working to support the rights of families and adolescents to access gender-affirming medical care have developed no such effective rhetoric. Subsequently, bills banning gender-affirming care are being introduced and increasingly signed into law.If we don\u2019t know history, we are doomed to repeat it. It\u2019s vital that people recognize today\u2019s anti-trans attacks for what they are: recycled strategies from the 1990s to spread misinformation and fear toward LGBTQ communities.Colorado\u2019s Amendment 2. Given the composition of today\u2019s high court, this backstop is unlikely to work. If people don\u2019t wake up to this reality and continue to be drawn into the GOP\u2019s false and emotional rhetoric, we are in for a horrifying period of US history."

        "text": "Editor\u2019s Note: Peter Bergen is CNN\u2019s national security analyst, a vice president at New America, and a professor of practice at Arizona State University. He is the author ofand was the founding editor of the. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. View moreat CNN.According to a new report, half a million Americans may have died unnecessarily of Covid-19. At the same time, the US government spent trillions to deal with the pandemic when better preparedness could have saved many lives and much money.\u00a0American schools were also closed for many months unnecessarily, with students paying the price.The report, \u201cLessons from the Covid War,\u201d by the Covid Crisis Group, is being published as a 347-pageTuesday. It will likely stand as the most authoritative account of American policy failures and successes during the war against Covid-19.The report makes for sobering reading, concluding that \u201cno country\u2019s performance was more disappointing than the United States.\u201d The group came to that conclusion because, despite the great depth of scientific knowledge in the United States, American \u201cexcess deaths\u201d during the pandemic were about 40% higher than the European death rate.If the US had had a similar rate to Europe by the end of 2022, \u201cprobably\u201d at least half a million Americans wouldn\u2019t have died, according to the report. That\u2019s a big number. The federal government also deployed $5 trillion to deal with the consequences of the pandemic. That is also a big number.So how did the US get into this mess?Given America\u2019s hyper-partisanship, just about everything about the Covid-19 pandemic was deeply politicized \u2013 from the precise origins of the coronavirus in China, to lockdowns, mask-wearing, school closures, vaccines, and the best drugs for treatment.As a result, there has been scant official reckoning over how the government fared during the pandemic and what lessons might be learned for the inevitable next pandemic.A 2022 bipartisanseeking to establish a National Covid Commission never made it to the floor for a vote in the US Congress.\u00a0This is astonishing when you consider that more Americans have\u2013 around 1.1 million so far \u2013 than all the Americansgoing back to the American Revolution.End of data sharing could make Covid-19 harder to control, experts and high-risk patients warnSo, without a congressionally mandated inquiry like the 9/11 Commission, 34 American public health experts, physicians, and other policy experts decided to investigate what went right and wrong during the pandemic.Starting their work in early 2021, the non-partisan Covid Crisis Group conducted \u201clistening sessions\u201d with 274 people who had played some role in responding to the pandemic or had been affected by it.The group was directed by, a leading historian and former senior State Department official in the George W. Bush administration who had also served as the Executive Director of the 9/11 Commission, which had set the gold standard for how to conduct a comprehensive examination of a major catastrophe and the lessons that could be learned from it.Otherof the Covid Crisis Group includedof the University of Minnesota who had been publicly warning of the emergence of a global pandemic for a decade and a half before Covid-19 first emerged; Dr., the former Commissioner of the\u00a0US Food and Drug Administration and Dr., former chair of the Department of Bioethics at the National Institutes of Health.The report examines both the \u201clab leak\u201d theory that the coronavirus accidentally escaped from a research lab in Wuhan, China, and the natural transmission theory that the virus moved from a wild animal into humans. But the report doesn\u2019t come down on the side of either theory, which seems fair enough given the inadequate evidence.Opinion: Thought mRNA vaccines would end with the pandemic? Think againThe Chinese government\u2019s penchant for secrecy was onin the early days of the outbreak. As a result, the origin issue may never be fully settled as it would have required considerable transparency by the government about what was happening in Wuhan at the beginning of the pandemic.Yet, as the report points out, \u201cboth theories drive toward common urgent insights for action.\u201d If the virus occurred because of animal transmission, that calls for improved surveillance for new viruses, using tools such as monitoring both work absenteeism and Internet searches that might indicate new viruses may be making the rounds, as well as increased biomedical surveillance.And if it was a lab leak, better safeguards must be put in place for research on viruses worldwide given that \u201c\u201d will likely be one of the defining technologies of the 21st century.The American health system is a patchwork of 2,800 state and local systems, according to the report. This would have made a coordinated national response to Covid-19 challenging to pull off in any administration, but the Trump administration\u2019s response at the federal level \u201cfailed quickly.\u201dSome Trump officials did understand the likely dimensions of the Covid pandemic early on., a formerreporter who spoke Mandarin and had covered the SARS outbreak in China, served as senior director for Asia at the National Security Council. Pottinger warned then-President Donald Trump in late January 2020 that the virus spread quickly from human to human, often without apparent symptoms.Opinion: Were masks useless? The deceptive interpretation of what science tells usThe Trump administration soonnon-American travelers from China from arriving in the US. While that may have slowed the spread of the virus in the U.S. a bit right at the beginning of the pandemic, travel bansgiven that the coronavirus is so transmissible, often spreading without symptoms in an age of mass global travel.A problem in the US government\u2019s early response was the lack of effective tests for the virus during the first months of the pandemic. By contrast, South Korea, better prepared for the emergency, had tens of thousands of tests running daily by mid-February 2020, according to the report.The report found that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) \u2013 despite its name suggesting that it is at the forefront of preventing the spread of disease \u2013 didn\u2019t do operational pandemic preparedness,\u00a0but instead acts as a quasi-academic institution that collects and analyzes dataan incident has happened.\u00a0In a chilling finding, the report says when it came to tracking Covid-19 cases in the United States, researchers atmagazine\u2019sdid a better job in real-time than the CDC did.There has been scant official reckoning over how the government fared during the pandemic and what lessons might be learned for the inevitable next pandemic.Peter BergenCompounding the problem at the federal level was President Trump, who, as is well known, continuously played down the threat posed by the virus and refused to wear a mask when masking was one of the few tools that prevented the spread of the virus before vaccines. By April 2020, Trump had decided that Covid wasn\u2019t much worse than the flu, and he wanted to \u201creopen\u201d the economy as he was\u00a0\u201cdeep into his reelection campaign,\u201d according to the report.As a result, the Covid Crisis Group concluded that \u201cTrump was a co-morbidity\u201d with Covid.is a medical term meaning that a patient suffers from two or more chronic diseases simultaneously.With little in the way of federal executive leadership, the war against Covid-19 was left up to the governors of the 50 states and to local authorities. The conventional narrative that red states favored opening up for the economy\u2019s sake and blue states favored shutting down to save lives is overly simplistic, according to the report.Most states adopted more of a purple approach whether they were run by Republican or Democratic governors \u2013 they chose to begin to open up when the virus seemed to be abating, as it was in May 2020, and close back down again whenever the virus came roaring back, as it did in the winter of 2020-2021.Given the understandable angst that many Americans had over school closures, the report points to some fascinating data from UNESCO showing that in countries like France and Spain, schools closed or partly closed for only two weeks and 15 weeks, respectively. While in the US the average school closures lasted 77 weeks, which particularly affected children from disadvantaged communities and kids with disabilities.\u00a0\u201cClosed schools, even with remote education, failed many students, particularly those already most at risk for disrupted learning,\u201d the report noted.The UNESCO school data suggests that there must have been a more thoughtful way to manage American school closures. The report points toabout safe and smart ways to keep schools open that was undertaken by Covid Crisis Group member Danielle Allen of Harvard, Brown University, and the research institution, New America (where I work), as emblematic of an approach that could have been followed but wasn\u2019t. It included developing infection prevention and control programs at each school.The operation to develop workable vaccines was a true American success story. The report credits a framework outlined by Richard Danzig, a former US Secretary of the Navy with expertise in biowarfare, who wrote to an informal network of colleagues in late March 2020, advocating for \u201cpreviously unthinkable government support\u201d for vaccines financially and for expediting their laborious approval process.Danzig also recommended invoking the Defense Production Act so that the manufacturing of the vaccines could be scaled up quickly. Danzig said that if the right resources were directed at developing a vaccine, it could be available as quickly as only six months, which would be an extraordinarilyas typically effective vaccines take five to ten years to develop.Danzig\u2019s ideas helped germinate Operation Warp Speed, led on the Pentagon side by General Gustave Perna, an expert on logistics, and on the civilian side by a former Big Pharma executive, Dr. Moncef Slaoui. With political top cover provided by the president\u2019s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, who supported Operation Warp Speed, General Perna secured $26 billion to fund the operation, according to the report.Opinion: What went right and wrong on CovidThe vaccines that succeeded in Operation Warp Speed were based on messenger RNA (mRNA) rather than on a weakened or inactive form of the virus typical of many vaccines. Using mRNA, researchers made cells produce a protein that instigated the immune response against the coronavirus. Thehad been around for decades, but it had never been used in a workable vaccine.Companies such as Pfizer and Moderna produced effective vaccines in just months. The government invested $1 billion in Moderna and placed another $1.5 billion order for 100 million vaccine doses. Pfizer didn\u2019t take US government money during the research phase for its vaccine, but the government initially guaranteed tomore than 100 million doses from Pfizer for $1.95 billion.As Danzig had suggested, the Defense Production Act ensured that the materials needed to make the vaccines were quickly secured. At the same time, the government partnered with major American pharmacy chains to ensure that jabs got into arms quickly once they became available.The report underlines how a perfect constellation of factors made Operation Warp Speed succeed, including the right leaders at the Pentagon and in the private sector harnessing existing, long-term basic research into mRNA. Operation Warp Speed was arguably the most significant achievement of President Trump and his administration.You might have the best vaccines in the world, but that doesn\u2019t do you much good if there are substantial percentages of your own population who are hesitant to be vaccinated.A National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine panel co-chaired by Dr. Helene Gayle \u2013 who had led efforts to combat AIDS at the CDC \u2013 warned in October 2020 that the CDC needed to develop a campaign using behavioral science and social marketing techniques while partnering with hospitals, faith-based organizations, and community centers to help increase vaccination uptake. But as the report notes, \u201cThat didn\u2019t happen.\u201dVaccinations also became politicized; by July 2022, 90% of Democrats reported being vaccinated to some level, compared to only 69% of Republicans.\u00a0It turns out that your politics, in this case, could literally kill you.During the Delta wave of Covid-19 in 2021 and the Omicron wave of 2022, \u201cthe vast majority of hospitalized patients were unvaccinated,\u201d according to the report. By early 2022, one study found that there were somewhere between 120,000 and more than 350,000 excess deaths in the US because of vaccine hesitancy.The key to preparing for the next pandemic is, of course, preparedness. The Covid Crisis Group underlines how \u201ctime is everything\u201d when managing a possible pandemic, as just one week can mean the difference between a mere outbreak and the emergence of a full-blown pandemic. That means creating \u201cearly warning radars\u201d worldwide that can detect emerging threats and ensuring the most stringent controls at labs around the world doing \u201c\u201d research so manipulated viruses don\u2019t escape into the outside world.The Covid Crisis Group has performed a major public service with its comprehensive investigation of the pandemic, an investigation that the US political system proved largely incapable of doing. This itself points to a general failure of American governance that the report underlines on many of its pages.Still, the publication of this report by a group of concerned experts is also a testament to the enduring strengths of American civil society, whichhad noted in his travels around the United States almost two centuries ago."

She is releasing the anthologythis coming August.\u00a0The views expressed here are her own. Readon CNN.Last year,took the helm of Poetry Magazine, a venerable magazine that turned 110 years old on his watch. Matejka, who was born in Germany as part of a military family and grew up in Indianapolis, Indiana, became the first Black person ever to edit the magazine.\u00a0For National Poetry Month this year, he talked with\u00a0Tess\u00a0Taylor\u00a0about rap, public service, writing a graphic novel \u2013 \u201cLast On His Feet: Jack Johnson and the Battle of the Century,\u201d \u2013 community gardening and building a big tent for art, as well as what it means to take over a storied literary institution and build it for the present.: You know, I wanted to be a rapper, but I was terrible at it.\u00a0No rhythm, no flow,\u00a0so I gave it up.\u00a0Then I heard Yusef Komunyakaa read. And when I heard him, I was just like, you gotta be kidding me. It sounded.\u00a0I knew I wanted to do what he was doing. I had no idea how hard it actually is to make a poem\u2026. No idea. I just knew I wanted to engage.\u00a0This was in Bloomington, Indiana, in college. I don\u2019t think I\u2019d even read a poem before then. And Yusef was doing a fundraiser for a coffee shop that he liked to write in. The only coffee shop in Bloomington at the time, Runcible Spoon. It\u2019s still there.\u00a0They have amazing blueberry pancakes. And this one day Yusef was in a corner with \u2014 you remember Mr. Microphone? The little speaker and amplifiers? Something like that, just in a corner. I had never heard anything like that. I hate to be dramatic about it. But I felt like my life changed when I heard him read.You know, it\u2019s pretty heavy.\u00a0 When you think about 110 years, and I\u2019m the first Black lead editor? There\u2019s only been one woman as lead editor, Harriet Monroe,\u00a0and shethe magazine. In between, some of the most famous poets to walk the earth have appeared in the pages. On the one hand, we have this beautiful artistic history, part of the history of our art in America. On the other hand, we\u2019ve got spaces, gaps and absences in that history that need to be attended to. I\u2019m really proud of the work we\u2019ve been doing since I came into the building. But it\u2019s also, like I said, a heavy history. It\u2019s not easy to untangle the politics and aesthetic challenges that have taken place from one decade to the next for 110 years.Opinion: How 17 syllables a day can change your life: We\u2019ve been doing these folios \u2014 deep selections of 20-30 pages \u2014 of people who haven\u2019t appeared in the magazine previously but who should have. My very first issue had one dedicated to Carolyn M. Rogers, who was a finalist for the National Book Award and a citizen of Chicago, you know, co-founder of the oldest independent Black press, Third World Books. She was never in the magazine. After that, Will Alexander, Diana Sol\u00eds, Bert Meyers and more. Over the years, there were many, many poets from marginalized communities who never had space made for them. That\u2019s part of our mission: to try to make that room in the contemporary version of Poetry.: Recently, I realized I don\u2019t really think of myself as an editor, I think of myself as a convener \u2014 hopefully of an editorial space that is\u00a0inviting and\u00a0capacious enough to hold the wide range of aesthetics of contemporary poetry. As you know, more people are writing poetry right now than ever before. Their wants and their desires for what\u2019s on the page change with geography, change with nation, with identity. But there is a deep desire to connect, to listen and to be heard. And so being able to create a space that can hold all of those wants without judgment or hierarchical construction is a challenge, but it\u2019s what the editorial team and I have been trying to do. We want to make room for everybody without losing rigor. To be inviting, to be welcoming, but also to remain rigorous in our craft.: Poetry for me has always been something that soothed, that comforted, that gave me a megaphone for my language, especially when I felt frustrated or unhappy. A poem allows us to amplify our own voices when other people turn the volume down. I don\u2019t think it changes much of anything, politically. Writing a poem is not going to transform gun laws. Poetry doesn\u2019t make the distribution of resources or commitment to infrastructures more caring or equitable. What it can do is help us cope inside of those inequitable spaces. It can give us a different kind of perspective to maybe be more empathetic to our neighbors, more caring of the people around us.: You know, there are a lot of young poets who are moving into new spaces \u2014 I\u2019m thinking of Aimee Nezhukumatathil and Ross Gay\u2019s beautiful essays or Fatimah Asghar writing\u00a0screenplays and Nate Marshall dropping fire rap albums. Kaveh Akbar\u2019s forthcoming novel\u2026 there are so many examples. I\u2019m curious to see how that extrapoetic work influences poetry down the line. A poet can write anything. It\u2019s not true for writers in other genres, necessarily, but a poet can write anything. It\u2019s our secret weapon. Anyway, as you take on different projects, it requires different kinds of approach and balance creatively. And that\u2019s exciting too. So when I enter a space with this graphic novel it\u2019s also asking to be carried differently than a poem would.You may know this writer for his work on racism and slavery. Fatherhood made him find joy in the mundane: I think it\u2019s always resources. The Poetry Foundation just became a grant making organization. We committed to giving out $9 million, over a three-year period,\u00a0to organizations that support poetry. By committing that\u00a0$3 million a year, the Poetry Foundation became\u00a0one of the largest funders of poetry in America. That\u2019s how scarce resources are in our creative community, for all the poets doing poetic labor in our country. Right now, the next Emily Dickinson is hustling multiple jobs to keep the lights on, doing other work that takes away from their art to try to support their art, because there are so few organizations and bare infrastructures that support the art of poetry in the US.: Poetry is one of the most vital of the arts: it\u2019s\u00a0three\u00a0of the\u00a0nine\u00a0original Muses. It was here before movies, before radio, before novels. Poetry as an art helps us to recognize we\u2019re not alone. I\u2019m looking at a painting on the wall right now. I\u2019m looking at a sculpture on the table. That is the third or fourth level of art cognitively, if that makes sense. Poetry is the first level: It goes right into the ear and straight to the heart. Poetry has been siloed over the years and it\u2019s been absorbed into the academy, which in some ways changes its access and vitality. Some contemporary poets come to it with a different agenda than Langston Hughes or Gwendolyn Brooks or Lucille Clifton out of necessity. But one of the things\u00a0I\u2019ve been trying to do since I got to\u00a0Poetry\u00a0is untangle it from those institutions, and make room for people who don\u2019t have a poetry degree or who don\u2019t think about the art in two dimensions. For example, we take audio submissions so that people who are performance poets can submit to the magazine without having to flatten their art.But this new approach means asking new things of poets inside of the academy, too. It\u2019s not where you\u2019re writing as much as it is how you\u2019re approaching\u00a0the world around the poem. At Indiana University,\u00a0where I taught, incoming writers knew they would be working at the community orchard where all the food goes to the women\u2019s shelter. Or at an after school program for kids who don\u2019t have any place else to go. Writers at IU don\u2019t just get to\u00a0sit, write\u00a0and not give anything back. We want people to understand that poetry is living, and it\u2019s part of the community. It\u2019s not something that you just do in the attic. You know what I mean?I\u2019m trying to figure out how to replicate that outward facing ethos at the magazine. What does it look like as an editorial team, as a poetic institution,\u00a0to give back to the community? I mean, we\u2019re doing that through resources at the foundation, but I\u2019m talking about the curatorial team. I\u2019m talking about\u00a0Poetry\u00a0magazine. How do we give back?: The most important thing to do, as a new writer, is read. You know, you can\u2019t resist anything, you can\u2019t transform or advance anything,\u00a0without knowing what that thing is. You have to understand the shapes of poetry before you can change those shapes. So,\u00a0start with\u00a0Brooks\u2019\u00a0\u201cBlacks\u201d\u00a0or\u00a0Komunyakaa\u2019s\u00a0\u201cNeon Vernacular.\u201d\u00a0Or\u00a0\u201cWind in a Box\u201d\u00a0by Terrance Hayes. Just read, and read more, and then read even more. Find the poetry that leaves the back door of your brain open for you."

        "text": "Like many Black Americans of her day, my maternal grandmother subscribed for years to, publications that played the same role in the Black community thatandplayed for White Americans. The two magazines reflected back to our community the moments of signal importance and elevated the issues and individuals we cared most about.My grandmother held on to decades of copies that were most special to her. Plastered on their covers were the faces of the Supremes or Malcolm X or the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. These figures were household names even for White Americans, but for people who looked like us, they were Black royalty.In a pre-civil rights-era America, where the fury of racial hatred and oppression rained down on Black Americans every day, it was a comfort to keep these magazines as a reminder that \u2014 however much White society tried to diminish us \u2014 we as a people were bold, resourceful, intelligent, talented and gifted.These magazines that exalted Black excellence also provided a tangible reminder \u2014 one that could be seen on the coffee table and later stashed away for posterity on a closet shelf \u2014 that we could aspire to such levels of achievement as well.Holding those magazine issues decade after decade was also a way to remind us of the signature moments of our history. Some of those events were not celebratory: the assassinations of King and Malcolm X, for example. Those were tragic events for our entire country, but\u00a0Jet\u00a0and\u00a0Ebony\u00a0captured the particularly profound loss for a community sorely in need \u2014 especially in the 1950s and 1960s \u2014 of Black heroes and icons.Woman whose accusation led to the lynching of Emmett Till has died at 88, coroner saysOne particular magazine issue that my grandmother kept stands out in my memory above all others, capturing a grim, almost unimaginable horror from America\u2019s past.And that\u2019s why, when I heard the news that Emmett Till\u2019s accuser, Carolyn Bryant, had died, I immediately thought about a family reunion some 40 years ago or so, when my grandmother showed her assembled children and her grandchildren her copy of what has become perhaps the most famous\u00a0\u2014 and at the same time, the most grimly tragic \u2014\u00a0Jet magazine\u00a0issue.Thein that September 1955issue of\u00a0Jetshowed the mutilated body of Emmett Till, a mere boy of 14 at the time of his murder. Till had been snatched from the home of a relative in Mississippi in the dark of night for the alleged \u2014 and it was later revealed, imagined \u2014 offense of whistling at a White woman. His brutalized body was retrieved from the Tallahatchie River.It was an act of enormous heroism for his mother,,\u00a0to allow the barely recognizable body of her son to be shown in an open casket. It was an act of editorial vision \u2014 and courage as well \u2014 for the editors of\u00a0Jet\u00a0and\u00a0Ebony\u00a0(they were owned by the) to publish images of his body in their magazines. But the impact was enormous and immediate. It led to a huge public outcry and calls for change. Many believe it was a keystone moment that helped i.Till\u2019s death helped expose the wickedness of the Jim Crow South where any White man could wantonly and willfully take the life of virtually any Black man with impunity. The men accused of killing him\u00a0were acquitted by an all-White jury but later confessed to the crime in1956 during an interview withmagazine in an article\u201cThe Shocking Story of Approved Killing in Mississippi.\u201d The US Justice Departmentbut there were no indictments and no one was convicted of his murder.Relative of Emmett Till files lawsuit demanding sheriff arrest Carolyn Bryant DonhamIf you don\u2019t know the backstory of Carolyn Bryant or why her death matters, you should. She was the 24-year-old White store clerk who had accused Emmett Till. Thethat he went into the store to buy some candy and he whistled at her or called her \u201cbaby.\u201dThat story, which she, caused an innocent young Black teen to die a horrible death. Her lie was believed because she was a White woman. Her lie was believed because she was considered off-limits to Black boys and men. As recently as last year, adeclined to prosecute Bryant for her role in Till\u2019s death.This is the American history that Ron DeSantis, Donald Trump, the Tennessee Legislature and many others do not want to talk about. This is the America we want to hide from our children. Some would even do away with theplaced at the site of Till\u2019s murder \u2014 that\u2019s how much they want to deny the racism of America\u2019s past.Even today, Black people\u00a0\u2014 just as they did in Emmett Till\u2019s\u00a0\u2014 find themselves under assault for simply being Black while walking, sleeping, bird-watching, eating, driving, studying, grocery shopping, worshiping at church or going into a convenience store and being accused of passing a bad $20 bill \u2014 as George Floyd was when he wasby a police officer\u2019s knee pressed against his neck.

She died peacefully in her sleep this month at the age of 93. She was the beloved matriarch of our family \u2014 a\u00a0mixed-race girl born in the Jim Crow segregated South.Her own grandmother had been a slave who fell in love with and ran away with her slave owner\u2019s son, married him after the Civil War and moved to California, where they had 13 children.When I go through her things, the Emmett Till copy of\u00a0Jet is one of the keepsakes I will ask to keep as her eldest grandchild.

The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. Viewon CNN.of Ireland last week, as he was treated to a hero\u2019s welcome in a pageant-laden return to his ancestral home.Meanwhile, back in the USA, Biden is saddled within the low 40s, a traditional warning sign for any incumbent on the cusp of launching a campaign for reelection.\u00a0Even more concerning for the president are his ratings among the, which sit in the\u00a0mid-20s to\u00a0mid-30s, depending on the poll.Biden, who is expected to, has a significant body of achievements on which to run. But continued concerns about the economy\u00a0and\u00a0his age and capacities \u2013 he would be a record-breaking 82 at the time of his second inauguration \u2013 have bogged him down.Opinion: Why Biden is lying low ahead of 2024Even among Democrats, Biden\u2019s polling is ambiguous. Around 8 in 10the president is doing, but less than half say they want him to run again \u2013 and just 44% say they believe. (These numbers have actually.)Yet as he returned from the Emerald Isle, Biden was the all-but-certain nominee of his party. No serious primary challenger has emerged, though two candidates have:, heir to a hallowed name he has sullied with misinformed and irresponsible jeremiads about the dangers of vaccines; and Marianne Williamson, the author, spiritual teacher and progressive activist who ran and lost decisively in 2020. Neither is likely to mount a competitive challenge. And barring unforeseen circumstances \u2014 a presidential stumble or illness; a self-funding billionaire\u2019s yearning to run \u2014 no such challenge seems forthcoming.So is the absence of a real primary challenge simply the luck of the Irish?Mostly, no.First, there are enormous advantages to incumbency that discourage challenges.\u00a0 Presidents have national political and fundraising networks, and the awesome power, platform and trappings of the office. They also have control of their party apparatus.Serious challenges to even embattled presidents are rare.to President George H.W. Bush in 1992 failed (though it did damage Bush\u2019s chances for reelection).\u00a0And, the most recent candidate to launch a serious challenge, actually threatened the reelection campaign of incumbent President Jimmy Carter in 1980 but ultimately fell short.Opinion: If Republicans want to beat Biden, they can\u2019t ignore this realityPerhaps with that primary battle in mind, Biden has worked assiduously to court the progressive wing of the party, from which such Democratic primary challenges generally arise. His signature domestic achievement, the, included a number of significant and longstanding progressive goals: an historic package to combat climate change; a long-sought measure that empowers Medicare to use its huge market leverage to negotiate with pharmaceutical companies for lower prescription drug prices; a cap on insulin costs for seniors at $35; and several steps to strengthen and expand the Affordable Care Act.Biden also signed a massive infrastructure bill; the first significantin decades; and the Respect for Marriage Act, enshrining protections for same-sex and interracial marriage in federal law.And Biden has benefited from Republicans digging in their heels on issues such as abortion rights and guns, which has helped to.Second, structurally, the president has altered the playing field in a way that should make it harder for a challenger to elbow in. Biden\u2019s supporters on the Democratic National Committee\u00a0(DNC)and set up a firewall by voting toof early 2024 primary contests to favor states in which he would be expected to win handily.Gone completely from the official calendar are the Iowa caucuses, the traditional campaign kickoff event but one that treated Biden rudely with ain 2020. Instead, the calendar will begin in South Carolina, a Biden stronghold where Black and moderate\u00a0White\u00a0voters revived his flagging candidacy and launched him toward the presidency.New Hampshire, wherein 2020, is scheduled to go second, but it will be joined by Nevada, a state where Biden can expect better treatment., Michigan and Georgia, two other Biden-friendly states, will then\u00a0follow.are set in stone, however, as New Hampshire, long home to the first-in-the-nation primary (as distinct from the caucuses held in Iowa) is threatening to move its 2024 date forward, in defiance of the DNC, to keep its time-honored status. Republicans in Georgia could block the move to an earlier state primary date.Finally, there is former President Donald Trump, whose candidacy is a boost to Biden among Democrats.Despite his mounting legal woes, Trump, buoyed by his implacable base, remains a frontrunner to be his party\u2019s nominee in 2024. While\u00a0many\u00a0Democrats see the disgraced and indicted former president as eminently beatable, they have been down this road before. The specter of Trump, just one step away from a return to the presidency, is both horrifying and unifying.Biden\u2019s supporters have argued that, given the stakes, the party can ill-afford a fractious primary or newbie nominee. So, despite the concerns about Biden\u2019s durability and still-lingering disquiet among some progressives, the Democratic tribe\u00a0will likely\u00a0rally behind its aged but tested chief as their best bet to stop Trump again.Having endured doubts about his age and stamina four years ago, when he set\u00a0out on his successful\u00a0bid to oust Trump from the White House, Biden enters a new campaign relying on the wisdom of another famous Irish-American politician.\u201cDon\u2019t compare me to the Almighty,\u201d said the late Boston Mayor Kevin White. \u201cCompare me to the alternative.\u201d"

        "text": "Editor\u2019s Note: Joe Lieberman, an independent, is a former US Senator who represented Connecticut from 1989 to 2013. He was the Democratic vice presidential nominee in the 2000 presidential election. The views expressed in this commentary are his own. Viewon CNN.When Ralph Nader ran for president in 2000, he offered a simple rationale for a bid that would ultimately helpthe election for the Democratic ticket I was privileged to be on with Al Gore. In Nader\u2019s view, the two parties were ideologically indistinguishable.That argument was baseless. There wereinbetween the George W. Bush-Dick Cheney ticket \u2014 which ended up victorious, in part\u2014 and ours. For Nader, this wasn\u2019t really about the \u201ctwo-party duopoly,\u201d as he coined it. This was about histoGore and the Democratic Party to the left.Today, of course, no one can reasonably argue that the two parties aren\u2019t ideologically distinct. The core problem in Washington, DC, is that they\u2019re too divided to get much done.Though aof Americans long for the era when Republicans and Democrats worked together to find bipartisan solutions to big problems, many members of Congress refuse to work together on, theand other issues critical to the nation, even when bipartisanship is the way to restore our common prosperity and security.\u00a0Indeed, today, with Republicans controlling the House and Democrats the Senate, bipartisanship is the only way to pass any legislation.While undoing the divisions plaguing our political system will not be simple, there is one step that can be taken \u2014 and it begins with giving voters a real alternative in the 2024 presidential election.Most often, when Americans cast their votes for president and vice president, their ballot has only two viable tickets: one nominated by the Democratic Party and the other by the Republican Party. But what would happen if they had a third viable option?The process for adding that third viable option is not only arduous and time-consuming, but itand in the District of Columbia.Opinion: Don\u2019t count DeSantis out yet; the GOP\u2019s 2024 race is far from overToday,, a nonprofit organization that I co-chair, is laying the groundwork for such a campaign in 2024. Since early 2022, our team has been diligently working across the country to obtain ballot access for a potential No Labels ticket, typically by collecting a certain number of petition signatures from voters in each state.If we are successful, a unity ticket \u2014 comprised of one Democrat and one Republican \u2014 could be presented to voters right next to the Republican and Democratic nominees.We think of this as an insurance policy for the country \u2014 an option to be deployed if, and only if, both of the two major party nominees fail to offer voters a choice of candidates they\u2019d like to vote for or a way out of the partisan divisiveness that now dominates in the nation\u2019s capital. We will be consistently monitoring the sentiment of Americans through our own research and polling, as well as public polling, to make that determination.In this and several other ways, No Labels\u2019 effort could not be more different from the \u201cspoiler\u201d campaign that Nader attempted two decades ago.First, if No Labels were to lend its ballot lines to a presidential ticket, the presidential candidate would be a Democrat and the vice presidential candidate would be a Republican, or vice versa. As such, it would appeal to some voters who might otherwise have voted for the Democratic ticket, and other voters who might otherwise have voted for the Republican ticket. And it would appeal to still other voters who would not have voted for either.Opinion: Why Biden is lying low ahead of 2024These nominees would be selected by a diverse and distinguished group of citizens serving on a committee \u2014 and would be ratified by delegates who would gather at the No Labels National Convention planned for April 2024. This convention will occur about six weeks after the March 5th \u201cSuper Tuesday\u201d primaries, a day which historically has clarified who the major party nominees will be.Second, No Labels\u2019 2024 effort is not designed to push the Democratic nominees to the left or Republican candidates to the right. Rather, it\u2019s intended to force one or both parties to appeal to America\u2019s growing commonsense majority. If they don\u2019t, our ballot line will create the opening for a unity ticket that will.According to, the number of individuals who identify as independent is on the rise, now comprising 41% of the electorate \u2014 compared to only 28% who described themselves as Democrats and 31% who described themselves as Republicans. These numbers are more evidence that there could be a potential path to victory for an independent ticket in 2024.But if there doesn\u2019t appear to be such a path in the months ahead, No Labels will stand down, focusing instead on the work we have done over the last decade to elect and organize members of the House and Senate who have demonstrated the courage to reach across the aisle \u2014 including members of the bipartisanIt seems the Biden administration already may be beginning to recognize the imperative of appealing to the commonsense majority. President Joe Bidena Republican measure to strike down a Washington, DC, crime bill reducing penalties for those who commit violent crimes, and he announced more stringentpolicies.Our hope is that the Republicans jockeying for their party\u2019s nomination will similarly see the need to reach out beyond their base instead of appealing topolicies and politics.In the end, No Labels hopesto have to offer our ballot line to an independent unity ticket. We want the parties to come to their senses. But judging from the angry and apocalypticof strategists in both parties at the thought of No Labels\u2019 insurance policy, it is clear that party leaders now know that there could be a political cost to ignoring the commonsense majority. And that\u2019s a reason to hope for a better future for our government and our country."

        "text": "Editor\u2019s Note:David Lowery\u2019s \u201cPeter Pan and Wendy,\u201d a new Disney+ film out Friday, tries to sidestep the colonialism at the heart of \u201cPeter Pan\u201d by employing less uniformly White casting than other remakes. It\u2019s a worthy effort, but racism, unfortunately, is harder to disarm than Captain Hook.Peter Pan was, and remains, popular because it combines ideas about childhood and\u00a0still-beloved pulp colonialist tropes into an exciting,\u00a0whimsical\u00a0narrative. Children are (supposedly) carefree, creative and eager for new experiences. At the same time, in England and the West, colonies were seen as dangerous, exciting venues for adventures.Author J.M. Barrie linked these two, recognizing that the people over there were often seen as childish and irresponsible, contrasting them with the staid norms of the imperial center. Peter Pan\u2019s message is that if you just travel to the British colonies, you can recapture lost time and lost youth.That message was hugely appealing at the time; the initial 1904 play had a, and Barrie turned it into a successful novel as well. Over the years, as the colonial implications have grown less and less comfortable, many creators have tried to. But in every version, including the most recent, a Neverland without racism remains elusive.Theof \u201cPeter Pan\u201d aired in 1924 andwas a fairly straightforward filming of the play. Wendy Darling and her two brothers are whisked off to the magical, vaguely Caribbean realm of Neverland by the impish Peter Pan and his tiny glowing fairy companion Tinkerbell. There the Darlings learn to fly and join forces with Peter\u2019s followers, the Lost Boys, to fight pirates led by Captain Hook and Native Americans.Those Indians are presented as unabashed stereotypes. Tiger Lily, the Indian princess, is played by, a Chinese American actress. Hollywood at the time apparently thought that all non-White people were interchangeable.Racist as the 1924 version was, the iconic 1953 animated film was somehow even worse. The illustrators were able to distort the Native Americans\u2019 appearance even more, turning them into. They are onscreen for much longer, and there\u2019s a profusion of slurs. The children parody the Indians, who are themselves a parodic imitation of children playing at racist imperial imaginings.It\u2019s a painful illustration of the way that non-White people are seen as infants and their land as a playground for White people\u2019s fantasies and wars. Barrie delights in the adorable innocence of children, and in their capacity for imagination and play. But their innocence is illustrated in part by creating a racism-filled analogy with supposedly less-developed communities; adulthood means growing into responsible Britishness.Peter Pan\u2019s popularity continued with a hit 1954 musical that was turned into a hugely successful 1956 television broadcast starring Mary Martin as Peter Pan. But by 1991, when Steven Spielberg\u2019s \u201cHook\u201d was released, the Native American caricatures were widely recognized as offensive. The story \u2014 involving a grown-up accountant Peter Pan () returning to Neverland to battle Hook () \u2014 excises native people from the narrative altogether.Opinion: \u2018Just read, and read more\u2019 \u2014 a groundbreaking poet\u2019s advice\u201cHook\u201d tries to add people of color in other ways \u2014 but runs into racist stereotypes when it does. Filipino-American actoras Rufio, an adolescent who leads the Lost Boys in Peter\u2019s absence, is an appealing and energetic character. However, with numbing inevitability, Rufio is first made to kneel in deference to the White adult Peter and is then murdered to give Peter motivation to fight Hook with renewed fierceness. It\u2019s a speedrun of racist moviemaking tropes.Recent adaptations have tried to add even more non-White actors. Most notably, \u201cWendy\u201d in 2020 cast a Black actor,, as Peter Pan, and in this year\u2019s version, Peter is played by, a mixed-race actor. Tinkerbell is played by Black actress Yara Shahidi and\u00a0Cree actress Alyssa Wapanatahk plays Tiger Lily. But the colonial framework is still in force. Both \u201cWendy\u201d and \u201cPeter Pan and Wendy\u201d make their non-White Peters less heroic, less competent and more morally compromised.The intention in both is to elevate Wendy as the hero, giving her more agency and adventuresomeness than the sexist prototype in Barrie\u2019s writing. But in centering (White) Wendy, the Peters\u00a0of color\u00a0are pushed toward stereotype.They\u2019re not the heroes of their own stories but childlike colonized people whom the White protagonist has to save, physically and spiritually. The films both become tales of White women going on an adventure to educate and elevate non-White people (in the Disney+ film, Wendy ends up flying better than Peter in the third act).The problem is that the narrative associates Peter with the colonies. He\u2019s a Tarzan/Natty Bumppo/character who leaves Europe (running away from his mother to avoid growing up), learns the ways of non-White people and becomes the greatest warrior/hero/leader among them.Casting Peter as a POC flattens out some of the most offensive connotations. But it retains the basic imperial dynamics. White people like the Darlings adventure in the colonies because the colonies are where childlike people such as Peter live and have childlike adventures. An adaptation that wanted to escape from that narrative probably needs to give a person of color the role not of Peter Pan, but of Wendy.Wendy is the one in the story who is supposed to change and grow up; she\u2019s the one who is less of a symbol and more of a person. She\u2019s how the story recognizes that childhood isn\u2019t an eternal state which exists over there, but a temporary thing. If she\u2019s always White, that reserves development, and adulthood, for White people. White Wendy is a White person setting aside her whiteness briefly to stay young and free. A POC Wendy looking for freedom in a less White world, though, means something potentially quite different.Of course, British history and creative works are soaked in colonialism, and Peter Pan is hardly the only one unable to overcome this past just by casting more diverse actors.Manyof the 2020s romance drama \u201cBridgerton\u201d have noted that themostly avoids engaging with the history of slavery and abolition in Britain, preferring to imagine a post-racial past in which people of color such as a Black\u00a0Duke of Hastings (played by)\u00a0face no prejudice or stigma. As a result, it ends up blinding itself to its own racist dynamics. The series, for example, largely ignores the connotations of a storyline in which aa Black man.In the same vein, the last James Bond film finally gave us a\u2014 but she (like Rufio) quickly defers to the white male version, essentially cosigning his authenticity and value.Racism and colonialism are built into the workings of these stories, and switching in different actors isn\u2019t enough to address that. Hollywood and big budget productions have been leery of more ambitious narrative changes, however, presumably fearful that they\u2019ll alienate fans of a given franchise or genre.Barrie\u2019s novel is a lot of fun in a lot of ways. But it\u2019s also extremely racist in its presuppositions, its morals and its ideas about who is and is not childish. If you want to keep telling this story, and don\u2019t want your retellings to be racist and colonialist, you have to put some work in and take some chances. I appreciate that recent adaptations, including Lowery\u2019s \u201cPeter Pan and Wendy,\u201d are trying. But Peter Pan was created in important ways out of racism, and no one in film has yet figured out how to make him fly free of it."

        "text": "Editor\u2019s Note:For the, Hollywood writers are on strike, which means the industry is forced to hit pause on producing many of your favorite television shows.Good for the writers. We should all stand with them \u2013 and perhaps emulate them.Writing as a profession feels more precarious than ever (take it from me, a freelance journalist). Opportunities for writers feel like they\u2019re constricting as once-great, many companies rely on a force of often-disposable freelancers, and.At the heart of the conflict between the writers and the studios is the writers\u2019 fairly straightforward desire for some\u2013 to not be treated like gig workers, and to make writing for television a sustainable career into the future.In afrom Writers Guild of America leadership, the union said that the studios \u201chave closed the door on their labor force and opened the door to writing as an entirely freelance profession. No such deal could ever be contemplated by this membership.\u201dAccording to the negotiating committee for the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP), who represent the Hollywood Studios, the union\u2019s \u201cprimary sticking points are \u2018mandatory staffing,\u2019 and \u2018duration of employment\u2019 \u2014 Guild proposals that would require a company to staff a show with a certain number of writers for a specified period of time, whether needed or not.\u201d,\u00a0 they\u00a0\u201cpresented a comprehensive package proposal to the Guild last night which included generous increases in compensation for writers as well as improvements in streaming residuals.The AMPTP also indicated to the WGA that it is prepared to improve that offer, but was unwilling to do so because of the magnitude of other proposals still on the table that the Guild continues to insist upon.\u201d\u00a0And management is under pressure as the TV and movie industries facethat have led to layoffs and budget cuts in an effort to make streaming profitable and sustainable.The union\u2019s demands seem entirely reasonable. Television writers, like most workers in America, deserve predictable working periods. Workers in most industries should not simply be at the beck and call of their boss, employed when convenient and discarded when not. It should be on the studios to anticipate how many writers they may need, and to pay workers fairly, even if they miscalculate. Otherwise, all of the burdens of a freelance system fall on the freelancers, and none on the employer.How a writers\u2019 strike might affect your favorite TV showsLucky for Hollywood writers, then, to have a union. These kinds of reasonable demands are not easily made by individual writers, who simply don\u2019t have the power to tell potential bosses \u201cyou have to hire me for a specified period of time.\u201d In a one-on-one\u00a0negotiation, bosses can simply laugh them off and go hire someone else. But when writers all band together to bargain collectively, their.That, of course, is, which are the reason we have, child labor laws (that, notably,), minimum wages (the raising of which), worker safety regulations and workers compensation, among many other protections.But unions aren\u2019t just a relic of an age in which a manual labor force needed basic protections, like safety equipment and no more kids in\u00a0coal mines.\u00a0In an era wherebetween a company\u2019s top brass and its workers is wider than ever \u2013 American CEOs now make an average of $670 in pay for every $1 a worker makes \u2013 the ability for workers to advocate for themselves is more necessary than ever. And if history is any guide, workers are at their most powerful when they stand together.It has been thrilling over the past few years to see what has looked like a resurgence of unions in the US. Workers at some of America\u2019s most recognizable companies, including, have attempted to unionize; in my own industryto advocate for better pay and fairer employment practices. But the unfortunate truth is that despite better coverage of unionization efforts, American unions are not doing particularly well.The high-profile unionization efforts at Amazon and Starbucks had mixed results asand often.and has been for decades. In fact, the percentage of Americans in a union is at its lowest ever: Just 1 in 10.Of course, not all jobs lend themselves to unionization. But the decline of unions in the US has come alongside a decline in worker power, and an increase in the power of companies to exploit workers, all coupled with a government that provides far too little for its citizens.American workers overwhelminglythat are considered basic in similarly developed and prosperous countries,\u00a0from paid parental leave to paid vacation to universal healthcare. Our health care remains \u2013 bizarrely \u2013 tied to employment, which gives companies significant power over workers, who are far less free to quit, demand better treatment, or seek employment elsewhere if their ability to avoid medical bankruptcy hinges on maintaining their job.Globalization has come with many positives, including, but it has also created fears that companies will simplyif their American workers demand too much. And business interests, often with support from the\u00a0Republican Party, have pushed Orwellian-named \u201c\u201d laws in a growing number of US states. Now, more than half of states have Right to Work laws on the books,\u00a0which throw up barriers to union membership and make it much, much harder for workers to collectively bargain.It\u2019s true that, historically, unions thrived when manufacturing and other blue-collar industries did. But over and over again, people in industries excluded from unionization have shown what\u2019s possible, fromto Hollywood creatives.Will it be annoying ifsuddenly goes dark or doesn\u2019t have fresh episodes? Sure. But a little perspective is in order: One reason you\u2019re at home watching television and not working all day and night in a dangerous poverty-wage job is because of unions. And many of our workplaces, and certainly American work culture, could be vastly improved if workers had more say and companies were more accountable. Plus, if you appreciate a creative output like television, you should want to support the creative people who make it.The Hollywood writers are taking a much-needed stand for their own rights and the future of their industry. That\u2019s admirable \u2013 and more Americans should be asking themselves if a union might improve their lives, too."

        "text": "Editor\u2019s Note:It\u2019s official: President Joe Biden announced Tuesday he is running for reelection. Also official: Nobody is very excited about it.According to, Biden\u2019s approval rating among all adults is stuck at 41%, with 55% disapproving,for any modern president. Evenat this stage of his presidency.The last time Biden\u2019s approval has been at or abovewas 21 months ago, per Gallup.But\u00a0the\u00a0news gets worse as Americans look to the future. Anfound that 70% of Americans believe Biden should not run for reelection, including 51% of Democrats. About half of those who said he shouldn\u2019t run believe his age is a major reason.What\u2019s worse is\u00a0that\u00a0Biden\u2019s age is apparent whenever he appears in public. It seems every speech Biden offers delivers another gaffe, every appearance on stage, another stumble. Even hisshows a man largely hiding from the camera.If inaugurated a second time, Biden will be 82 years old and 86 by the term\u2019s end. But Biden is not the only old public servant in office. Much of ouris also led by people well past retirement age.America today is less a democracy than a gerontocracy.As much grief as Baby Boomers get, Biden is a pre-boomer, belonging to the Silent Generation. The president passed thefour years ago. For comparison, theis 38.8 \u2013 less than half his age. Ultimately, this isn\u2019t an argument about age but\u00a0about\u00a0a detailed understanding of our fast-moving world.Opinion: I don\u2019t love Biden, but I\u2019m terrified of TrumpTechnological advancements are obvious, but social, political and international changes have been equally significant. Our society and the world at large look a whole lot different than they did half a century ago.That\u2019s why we need a president offering fresh ideas, innovative solutions and the ability to anticipate near-term changes. Instead, Biden remains mired in the past.Age wasn\u2019t as much of an impediment in 2020. Biden is less than four years older than Donald Trump, which didn\u2019t set much of a contrast. Outside of Trump, the GOP primary features a young field, with the likely leader being 44-year-old Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who hasn\u2019t thrown his hat in the ring yet.Last time around, Biden was an ideal antidote to Trumpism. The former vice president was portrayed as a kindly grandpa, slightly goofy, yet an old, reliable hand in the center of the Democratic Party. Pull the lever for Joe and you can get back to ignoring politics. No scandal-of-the-day or late-night tweetstorms, just the bland guy you\u2019ve seen in the news for 50 years.Independents and moderate Republicansand awaited the promised return to normalcy. That\u2019s not what they got.Scandals were replaced with crises. Everything from thetoto ato Ukraine, not to mention thein four decades. Every time voters filled their tank or headed out for groceries, they were reminded of Biden\u2019s failure.Mean tweets were replaced by an increasing number of gaffes, misstatements and troubling behavior by America\u2019s oldest president in history. During the campaign, it was passed off as \u201cJoe being Joe,\u201d but it keeps getting worse.These complaints used to come from the right, but more and more Democrats have spoken out.Last year, Obama campaign chief strategist David Axelrod warned against a reelection run. \u201cThe presidency is a monstrously taxing job, and the stark reality is the president would be closer to 90 than 80 at the end of a second term, and that would be a major issue,\u201d hethe New York Times.Former Secretary of Labor under President Bill Clinton Robert Reich also pointed to Biden\u2019s age and reduced faculties. \u201cThis isn\u2019t an \u2018ageist\u2019 prejudice against those who have reached such withering heights,\u201d Reichin The Guardian, \u201cso much as an understanding that people in mid-80s do wither.\u201dNevertheless, the Democratic Party has all but canceled their presidential primary. The Democratic Party said they\u2019re backing Biden\u2019s reelection bid and have no plans to sponsor primary debates,. At the moment the only declared opponents are fringe characters like Marianne Williamson and Robert F. Kennedy Jr.We wish everyone the best health and many more happy years. All of us are getting older and we\u2019ll be lucky to live as long as Biden. But if Democrats want to preserve their future, they have to cut their party leader loose. Sooner rather than later."

She is the author of \u201cThe Big Letdown\u2014How Medicine, Big Business and Feminism Undermine Breastfeeding.\u201d The opinions expressed in this commentary are her own. Viewon CNN.In 2020, Dr. ChanieceWallace, a pediatrician whoSchool of Medicine, died\u00a0just two days after giving birth to a daughter, Charlotte.Shamony Gibson studied at New York University and Medgar Evers College andjust 13 days after giving birth to her second child.In 2017, Dr. Shalon Irving, who was an epidemiologist with the\u00a0US\u00a0Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and a lieutenant commander in the US Public Health Service Commissioned Corps,three weeks after giving birth after being ignored when returning to the hospital for care.In 2016 Kira Johnson, who had two degrees, spoke five languages and was the daughter-in-law of TV\u2019s Judge Hatchett,after a routine C-Section in a Los Angeles hospital.Motherhood is said to be the 'best time of your life.' For these nine women, it was the worstThese tragic deaths highlight what Black women have known for years: that being well-educated and well-resourced simply are not fully protective factors when it comes to maternal mortality and morbidity. Serena Williams\u2019safter giving birth only underscored that., Black women in the US were 2.9 times more likely to die during or after childbirth than white women, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. More notably, apublished in January showed that the wealthiest Black moms are more likely to die in childbirth than the poorest white moms.uses California administrative data to show how household income alone is not protective from racism\u2019s impact on maternal and infant health outcomes. It is clear Black maternal mortality is not just a low-income problem.But a current wave of policy and advocacy work ison reimbursing doulas and offering needed pregnancy-related services to. Doulas, trained birth professionals who serve as educators and advocates to pregnant women, have been shown to be both, improving birth outcomes for Black women, but alsoby reducing the hospital expense of preterm births and C-sections.In Oakland, the innovative Beloved Birth centering program with remarkable outcomes in reducing pre-term birth rates provides a doula, fitness trainer, chef-prepared meals for six weeks postpartum, a pregnancy photo shoot, midwifery-led prenatal visits, and a lactation consultant\u2014but thisis currently only available to Black women on Medical, the state\u2019s Medicaid program. In New York City, the first free doula program is focused on marginalized zip codes.US maternal death rate rose sharply in 2021, CDC data shows, and experts worry the problem is getting worse\u201cJust because you are not Medicaid eligible does not mean you can fully afford a doula or any other birth professional that Black women need,\u201d said Tracie Collins, CEO and Founder of the National Black Doula Association (NBDA) and host of the Healthy Girl podcast in an interview via email. \u201cToo many Black women are falling in the gap.\u201dDoulas are only one piece of a complicated puzzle that ultimately must include cultural change within medical institutions and systemic change overall. For years, much of theinto thetreated Black women problematically \u2013 conflating income, education, and not getting prenatal care with high rates of preterm birth, low birthweight and maternal deaths.Now there isreflecting the underlying reality that regardless of educational attainment or related factors like income, Black women experience higher maternal mortality rates across the board. So why aren\u2019t more policy and advocacy efforts focused on providing pregnancy and postpartum services for Black women across the economic spectrum?The misconception and narrative that Black maternal mortality rates are tied to income has already caused harm. Black women professionals, scientists and medical doctors have shared with me their near-death misses in childbirth; several of them also shared that they too considered themselves not at a high risk. \u201cMany Black birthing folks reasoned \u2018If the so-called research said the problem is being poor and unable to advocate for yourself and I\u2019m not poor and am educated enough to advocate for myself then I will be ok,\u2019 that\u2019s false and dangerous thinking,\u201d said Chanel Porchia-Albert, the founder and executive director of Ancient Song Doula Services, a Brooklyn-based organization that provides doula services to women of color and marginalized communities.In my travels advocating for Black and brown patient experience data as a critical tool for systemic change, I meet many middle-class Black women who are not Medicaid eligible but don\u2019t make enough to afford the costs of a doula or at-home\u00a0postpartum support. Some ask friends and family to chip in and I encourage them to put it on their baby registry as something others can contribute to. But the idea of burdening other family and friends often does not sit well with them, and not every community member thinks of a doula as necessary when a crib, diapers and other essentials are also needed.To end America's maternal mortality crisis, dismantle the racism that fuels itTo be clear, efforts that focus on the needs of the under-resourced are critical. More than 3.3 million Black women,are covered by Medicaid.\u00a0 According to the, 11 state Medicaid programs currently reimburse doulas to a modest degree, and nearly a dozen are in some phase of the process to do so. This is an overdue recognition of the value of doulas and critical momentum to make sure they are accessible and paid a living wage.But Medicaid coverage alone is insufficient to meaningfully address the nation\u2019s Black maternal mortality crisis. This approach is short-sighted and continues to promote a dangerous narrative that research and too much anecdotal evidence has already disproven. \u201cMedicaid covers the majority of births in our community and other payers often follow Medicaid\u2019s lead when it comes to improving payment and coverage so setting the tone within Medicaid makes sense, but it can\u2019t be the end goal,\u201d Dr. Nathan Chomilo,\u00a0Medical Director for Minnesota\u2019s Medicaid & MinnesotaCare program, told me.To improve the support Black birthing people receive, more commercial health plans should commit to reimbursing doulas as well. In Massachusetts, both the state Medicaid program known as MassHealth and private health plans are compelled to pay doulas who have mettraining and credentialing criteria.Employers also need to step up and are positioned to provide access more directly. \u201cSixty five percent of people who get health insurance from their employer are in a self-funded plan \u2013 meaning those employers have a direct financial stake, in addition to the personnel/workforce stake, in keeping employees, including Black women healthy,\u201d Chomilo told me.The NBDA spearheaded a landmark partnership with Wal-Mart, one of the largest payers for pregnancy-related healthcare in the nation, to offeras an employee benefit.Policymakers are paying long overdue attention to reducing high rates of mortality and morbidity among Black women. But they must go further to fully address the maternal mortality disparities by addressing racism and bias in care beyond mandating training for healthcare providers without accountability, pushing for cultural and systemic change within medical schools and health systems, funding midwifery care models and birth centers for low-risk pregnancies, and ensuring there is policy advocacy and change across the economic spectrum for Black women.\u201cWe are all at risk when we choose to see the issue of Black maternal health from one side,\u201d said Porchia-Albert.In practice, principle, research, advocacy and messaging, we must leave no Black woman behind."

Unfortunately,\u00a0the decision won\u2019t stop attacks on reproductive freedom.In states such as Massachusetts that protect civil rights and women\u2019s health, we will be ready.Every American should be deeply concerned that one extreme, Trump-appointed federal judge in Texasto overturning the US Food and Drug Administration\u2019s approval of mifepristone, which has been used safely and effectively for more than 20 years.Mifepristone is used inof abortions in my state. The judge\u2019s decision, which ran contrary to science, medicine and the law, was an attack on women and on our health care system. And it would have disproportionately harmed those who already face the highest barriers to care and are less able to travel elsewhere to access it \u2014,, theand.Mifepristone saved my lifeIt\u2019s alarming that in the interest of advancing its nationwide crusade against reproductive freedom, the anti-abortion movement was willing to challenge the FDA\u2019s independent, trusted and science-based process for approving medications.Elements of this anti-women and anti-science movement have pushed for stringentas well as restrictions on insurance coverage for abortion. They\u2019ve encouraged lawmakers to impose unwarranted restrictions on providers of reproductive health care, including the imposition of burdensome mandatory waiting periodsfor abortions.The ban on mifepristone, had it remained in place, would have set yet another dangerous precedent: Which lifesaving, FDA-approved medication would they try to ban next? Which new, innovative medications wouldn\u2019t come to fruition because of these assaults on the FDA\u2019s regulatory process?That\u2019s why hundreds of prominent leaders in the drug and biotech industries. Their companies don\u2019t make mifepristone, but they knew that if the ruling by the judge in Texas were allowed to go into effect, it would have had devastating consequences for the regulation of all medications.As the governor of Massachusetts, the nation\u2019s, my opposition to the court ruling in Texas was rooted in concern over the negative impact it would have on women, doctors, our health care system, innovation and our economy.That\u2019s why Ieven before the ruling came down. In Massachusetts, we weren\u2019t going to let one extremist judge restrict access to care for women in our state. At our request, the University of Massachusettsof mifepristone this month that providers across the state can access.Anti-abortion advocates are using junk science to usurp the will of the American peopleOther health care providers purchased their own supplies, and we provided funding to assist state-contracted providers with the purchases. In total, we have enough doses in our state to last well over a year.I also took executive action to protect patients and providers who access these doses. Last year, following the\u00a0Dobbs\u00a0decision that overturned\u00a0Roe v. Wade, Massachusetts passed a law that protects patients and providers from facing civil or criminal liability for receiving or performing an abortion in the state.And after the ruling in Texas, I signed anconfirming that these protections include medication abortion and medical management of miscarriage. This ensures that providers, including pharmacists, can continue to use, prescribe, dispense and administer mifepristone and will protect providers and patients from criminal and civil liability for accessing this essential care.The bottom line: As a result of the Supreme Court\u2019s order staying the Texas judge\u2019s decision, mifepristone remains safe, legal and available nationwide. And because of the action we took, it will remain that way in Massachusetts regardless of the final outcome of this case \u2014 or any future attacks on reproductive freedoms.We might have avoided the worst possible outcome for now, but we know the anti-abortion movement isn\u2019t letting up. But neither will we. Alreadyhave lost access to abortion in their states because of the overturning of\u00a0Roe.Republican legislatures across the country areand penalties on providers for doing their jobs. Clinics have beenforced to close,\u00a0and many of those that remain are overwhelmed with need.This attack on women\u2019s freedoms is unacceptable. We will never stop protecting and expanding access to reproductive health care, including abortion. Democratic governors are going to continue leading this charge. We have the power to ensure that our states remain beacons of health, equity and hope \u2014 including welcoming those from states that are restricting abortion. We will always stand for civil rights and freedom.Medications should be approved based on their safety and efficacy \u2014 on science, not politics.\u00a0Patients in Massachusetts will continue to have access to abortion care. And providers in our state \u2014 without fear of legal repercussions \u2014 will be able to give their patients the essential care that they need and deserve."

View moreon CNN.After years of bad behavior, Kanye West is finally seeing some consequences.The rapper wasfrom Instagram for 24 hours after hurling a racial slur at \u201cThe Daily Show\u201d host Trevor Noah, who had devoted a segment of his show to calling out West\u2019s behavior toward his former wife, Kim Kardashian. West\u2019s performance at the Grammy Awards, which Noah is hosting, was also\u2013 although not at Noah\u2019s request. Three sources close to West confirmed to CNN that he was pulled from performing at the Grammys due to \u201cconcerning online behavior.\u201dWest has spent the past several months using his social media platforms to target his ex-wife, Kardashian, and her new boyfriend, \u201cSNL\u201d star Pete Davidson. West has postedabout Kardashian\u2019s parenting, saying it\u2019s on him to protect his family and suggesting that perhaps his ex is a bad parent. He released a music video depicting a Davidson lookalike being kidnapped and buried in the ground. Both Kardashian and Davidson have reportedly.By West\u2019s own account, Kardashian is. West posted a series of text messages purported to be from Kardashian asking him to please stop his social media attacks on her and her new partner: \u201cU are creating a dangerous and scary environment and someone will hurt Pete and this will all be your fault,\u201d the message. Along with the text screenshots, West posted, \u201cUPON MY WIFE\u2019S REQUEST PLEASE NOBODY DO ANYTHING PHYSICAL TO SKETE IM GOING TO HANDLE THE SITUATION MYSELF.\u201d He included an image of one man choking another.That wasn\u2019t enough to get West suspended from social media. Apparently, going after Trevor Noah was.The lesson being sent to powerful men is clear: Intimidate your ex and much of the public will laugh, especially if she\u2019s the kind of woman the public thinks kind of deserves it. It\u2019s also safe to assume that women whoabout what your ex is going through will have a hard time being heard. Go after a well-liked man who seeks to amplify that concern, though, and you\u2019ll pay a price.Kanye West suspended from Instagram for 24 hours after directing racial slur at Trevor NoahTo be clear, West should have been suspended for what he said about Noah. But his actions toward Kardashian and her new partner are just as concerning \u2013 if not more so. West practically put a target on both Kardashian\u2019s and Davidson\u2019s backs. And he made clear that he would like to physically harm Davidson, in part to hurt Kardashian.Why were his posts still up on Instagram? Why, in the middle of this very public series of online attacks, was he invited to perform at the Grammy awards to begin with?Instead of seeing this for what it is \u2013 a famous man using his notoriety to torment his ex \u2013 too many media outlets are portraying it as a \u201c.\u201d In a feud, there are two sides fighting each other. This is an attack.Kardashian is a professionally successful, beautiful celebrity who is notoriously \u201cfamous for being famous\u201d as a reality TV star. That seems to be shaping too much of the public response to her current situation. As Noah made clear in his segment, instead of seeing her as a victim of a very public stalking and harassment campaign, media narratives and fan responses position her as one player in a juicy drama.For many West fans, she\u2019s the villain breaking up her family, and West is ascorned. And even some, including The View\u2019s Sunny Hostin, have argued that removing West from performing at the Grammy\u2019s is a form of silencing free speech.Trevor Noah had nothing to do with Kanye West's Grammys performance being canceled, says sourceWest, on the other hand, has long had issues with women, and the public has simply laughed. When hefrom Taylor Swift at the 2009 Video Music Awards, interrupting her acceptance speech, much of the public laughed it off \u2013 sure, West was a \u201cjackass\u201d as former President Barack Obama put it, but that was just Kanye being Kanye. Years later, he bragged that he \u201cmade that b**** famous\u201d in one of his songs. (Kardashian, for what it\u2019s worth,for West.) West also trashed his ex Amber Rose after their breakup in crude and scurrilous terms, saying, \u201cI had to takebefore I got with Kim.\u201dOne person who does seem to understand the reality of this dynamic between West and Kardashian is Trevor Noah.\u201cYou may not feel sorry for Kim because she\u2019s rich and famous,\u201d Noah said in the same \u201cDaily Show\u201d segment that drew West\u2019s ire. \u201cBut what she\u2019s going through is terrifying to watch and shines a spotlight on what so many women go through when they choose to leave.\u201dNoah\u2019s accurate assessment of the Kardashian/West dynamic predictably set West off \u2013 nothing angers misogynist men quite like being called out for their actions. But it shouldn\u2019t have taken a racial slur to finally, temporarily pull West\u2019s social media access and remove him from a place of honor at the biggest night in music. His behavior toward his ex should have come with its own public consequences.One of the reasons many women struggle to leave abusive or otherwise unhealthy relationships: Fear of how their ex will behave, and fear that they will face social penalties. We\u2019re collectively seeing those fears come to fruition for Kardashian. The very public shrug-off of West\u2019s scary actions sends a message to women and men alike: Stalking and harassment are normal parts of ending a relationship; men who stalk and harass their exes won\u2019t face consequences; and women who are stalked and harassed can expect that they\u2019ll be treated as wrongdoers and heartbreakers, not victims.Thankfully, there are men like Noah who use their platforms to identify this dynamic for what it is. But it shouldn\u2019t take a good famous man to speak up for a badly behaving one to finally see consequences."

It\u2019s not the one with, or thein a franchise with the unofficial motto, \u201cGuns. Lots of guns.\u201d No, it\u2019s so much more upsetting than that: In, an 11-year-old girl (Abby Ryder Fortson).\u201cAre You There God? It\u2019s Me, Margaret,\u201d a film adaptation of Judy Blume\u2019s beloved 1970 novel, is getting rave reviews, with a near-perfect score on. The classic young adult book has been translated by director Kelly Fremon Craig into an oh-so-slightly modernized movie, still set in 1970, chronicling a year in the life of pre-teen Margaret. It\u2019s a big year, too: Margaret\u2019s parents move the family from Manhattan to suburban New Jersey; she\u2019s growing anxious about the onset of puberty and whether she\u2019s developing quickly enough to be \u201cnormal\u201d; and she\u2019s grappling with big questions about religion, as her nonreligious parents have told her she can choose her own faith when she\u2019s old enough.The movie\u2019s arrival makes for a darkly absurdist cultural moment. It\u2019s National Library Week, the time of the year when the American Library Association comes out with itsof the top 10 most challenged books. Says the ALA: \u201cLibraries in every state faced another year of unprecedented attempts to ban books. In 2022, ALA tracked the highest number of censorship reports since the association began compiling data about library censorship more than 20 years ago.\u201d They report a 38% increase in challenged titles from 2021 to 2022, and noted that most of the titles are by or about LGBTQIA+ people and people of color.Opinion: The problem with \u2018Peter Pan\u2019 that the new Disney+ movie doesn\u2019t solveThis occasion dovetails perfectly with \u201cMargaret,\u201d one of the most-challengedalongside her teenage romance \u201cForever\u201d. \u201cMargaret\u201dbecause of its discussions of puberty, specifically menstruation, and because it contains a character questioning the validity of religion and encountering a pair of cruel antisemites in her avidly Christian maternal grandparents, who have disowned Margaret\u2019s mother for marrying a Jewish man.Any sane person will recognize that both of these\u00a0objections are asinine \u2014 not that that ever stopped a book-banning campaign.\u00a0But I think there\u2019s a bigger reason why the GOP might consider \u201cMargaret\u201d a dangerous movie: It takes a wholly realistic view of toxic people and how to deal with them. Blume has an unmatched ability to dive into the messy complexity of human relationships in her young adult books. In \u201cMargaret,\u201d one of the most interesting plotlines is the title character\u2019s social circle, starting with her domineering neighbor Nancy Wheeler (played with great aplomb by Elle Graham). She\u2019s bossy, she\u2019s insensitive, she\u2019s capable of being cruel to easy targets\u2026 and she\u2019s a lot of fun.Blume rendered this portrayal of frenemy-hood long before that was a word; it may still be set 50 years ago, but it feels as fresh as ever. (A parallel storyline, which I believe has been added to the film, follows her mom\u2019s more cautious relationship to Nancy\u2019s alpha-mom character.) Then, of course, there are Margaret\u2019s antisemitic grandparents, who show up hoping she\u2019ll come into the Christian fold and \u2013 spoiler alert \u2013 are sent packing. If kids come away from the movie, or book, better prepared to navigate relationships with a-holes, maybe they\u2019ll also be better prepared to push back against the bigots trying to take away their rights and their education.There\u2019s even a plot point in \u201cMargaret\u201d that functions as a direct response \u2013 albeit a coincidental one \u2013 to the latest piece of backwards GOP legislation. In the film, Margaret\u2019s much-anticipated trip to Florida to see her grandmother (Kathy Bates) has to be scrapped. And that\u2019s just as well, because in our present-day reality,\u00a0Florida Republicans\u00a0think students in fifth grade or younger shouldn\u2019t be educated about, or allowed to talk openly about, their period or anyone else\u2019s.\u00a0In March, Florida Rep. Stan McClain introduced legislation that wouldany discussion of menstruation in schools before middle school (which starts at a later age than many girls get their first periods)., currently in the Florida Senate, is cruel, offensive, misogynist\u00a0and completely of a piece with the GOP\u2019s relentless.Thankfully,\u00a0one of Blume\u2019s greatest strengths is never, ever talking down to her young readers. She takes them and their problems very seriously, even when writing the comedic parts.

So I truly hope this one makes a killing at the box office, and that every single kid who wants to see it gets to.

        "text": "Editor\u2019s Note:Leaders everywhere are making their employees\u2019 blood boil. Two recent cases were so egregious that they made headlines.Andi Owen, a furniture company CEO, admonished her employees to \u201c\u201d and stop worrying about whether they would get their bonuses. Tech CEO James Clarke, meanwhile, said those who are bothweren\u2019t being \u201cfair\u201d to their companies (or children). In short, bosses are being positively infuriating \u2013 as they always have been.It may seem like contentious words and aggressive actions are the key to successful leadership, and it can feel good to exert our will. But bad behavior eventually turns people away and leaves leaders out in the cold.Shouting, insulting and threatening can leave considerable damage in its wake, leading to,. In the long run, aggressive and abusive approaches to leadership erode employee satisfaction and organizational commitment.What workers want is a. For the past 20 years, I have been studying why so many leaders are infuriating, and why so few are ever truly inspiring. The key to understanding why leaders fall into the infuriation trap is the insidious partner of leadership: POWER.Bosses can be so infuriating in part because of the large role they have in the lives of their employees. This broad power means leaders receive outsize amounts of attention, in which workers watch their bosses closely and intently \u2013 their behavior, words and expressions \u2013 giving them even more influence. The attention they receive, coupled with the power they wield, means their actions have an immediate and amplified impact on their employees. I call this the Leader Amplification Effect.But here\u2019s the thing: I\u2019ve found in my research thatthat they are on a metaphorical stage. They overlook the fact that what they say and how they say it \u2013 their causal glances, their incidental shifts in posture \u2013 are intensely scrutinized and analyzed. They are blind to their outsized impact in shaping the psychological experience of others. In short,, when their workers experience them as shouting.Women are burned out. Men, do your part!The good news is that the Leader Amplification Effect isn\u2019t a problem for bosses who recognize their impact and understand the power of their power. Unfortunately, though, it is their very power that often drains leaders of two of the most important qualities for a successful tenure:and.Being in a position of powerthe ability to put oneself in the shoes of others. In one of my most well-known, my collaborators and I randomly assigned half of our participants to be in a position of power by giving them control over an important resource, and we assigned the other half less power by making them depend on their partner for those resources.Before interacting, we asked each person to draw a capital letter E on their forehead. Go ahead and try it for yourself. It turns out some people draw the E so it looks like an E to others; we call this an other-focused E. But some people draw the letter so it is an E from their perspective but backward to others; we call this the self-focused E.Our experiment revealed that power dramatically affects the direction of the E. When people were randomly assigned to have power, they were almost three times more likely to draw the backward E. Power turned them into poor perspective-takers. Inwith Keely Muscatell, now at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, we have shown this effect in the brain: The neural circuitry that pays attention to others is less active when people have power.But it gets worse. Gerben van Kleef of the University of Amsterdam has found that the powerful are less likely to feel. It\u2019s no wonder leaders call the concerns of others a pity party or refer to working parents as selfish.If that wasn\u2019t bad enough, leaders can tend to lash out at others like a trapped predator. (While those without power may have the same emotions, those with power can actually act on them.) My research shows that just a touch of insecurity or the faintest whiff of disrespect can turn leaders into what I term Little Tyrants. In research with Maren Hoff, doctoral student at Columbia University, we have found that the powerful but insecure tend to hoard credit for success for themselves and refuse to share it with others. Not surprisingly, not receiving credit for one\u2019s efforts is deeply infuriating.Opinion: The hard lessons I learned the first time I was laid offIn otherled by Nathaneal Fast of the University of Southern California, we gave participants a list of 10 activities and asked them to select the behaviors their partner had to complete to be eligible for the $50 prize. Half the behaviors were demeaning and humiliating, e.g., say \u2018I am filthy\u2019 5 times. The other half were mild behaviors, e.g., tell the experimenter a funny joke.We found that when people were randomly assigned to have power but their assigned position also lacked status and respect in the eyes of others, they were significantly more likely to dole out demeaning behaviors to others. By granting people power while simultaneously making them feel disrespected, we had turned our participants into Little Tyrants.There is one final piece of the infuriation puzzle. My research with Joris Lammers of the University of Cologne has shown thatpeople who impose standards on others while violating those standards themselves. We found that this occurs because the powerful feel entitled to deviate from the rules while also feeling justified in demanding others follow those same rules. This is bad news, as leaders incite anger when they are hypocrites.These infuriating tendencies have a culminating effect that places leaders further out of touch: They make people reluctant to speak up and share their perspectives. I call this the Power Silencing Effect. One\u2019s power tends to muzzle the insights of others. And when people surrounding leaders don\u2019t share their thoughts, leaders slip deeper into obliviousness.So, what\u2019s the solution? How can leaders move from being infuriating to being inspiring?The first step is for leaders to be aware that they are always on stage. This awareness allows them to harness the Leader Amplification Effect to inspire others. For example, I\u2019ve observed that when leaders intentionally praise others for their efforts, they are perceived as inspiring. Similarly, when they share success with others, they can turn those individuals into loyal followers.The second step is to understand and reverse the Power Silencing Effect. As a leader, you will only get insights from others when you actively seek them outyou verbally and non-verbally express interest and encouragement. When your eyes betray contempt, the Power Silencing Effect becomes even stronger.Every leader has the power to be inspiring. But their power often turns them into little tyrants. The solution is to get a little perspective."

        "text": "Editor\u2019s Note:Robert Alexander is a professor of political science and founding director of theat Ohio Northern University. He is also the author of \u201c.\u201d Follow him on Twitter:. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. Viewat CNN.As the January 6 House select committeeto investigate the events surrounding the insurrection, there has been great interest in what is a typically overlooked, yet important component of the election process \u2013 the presidential electors who vote in the Electoral College.I have spent 20 years studying these little known figures, warning about thethey could cause. Yet even I have been surprised by what has been uncovered in the wake of the 2020 election. It has become clear that then-President Donald Trump wanted then-Vice President Mike Pence to use extraconstitutional powers to manipulate the tabulation of electoral votes to secure a second term despite his defeat in the election.One component of this scheme was to send phony electors to cast ballots in closely contested states that were carried by President Joe Biden. At the time, Trump adviser Stephen Miller: \u201cAn alternate slate of electors in the contested states is going to vote and we\u2019re going to send those results up to Congress.\u201dUpon hearing Miller\u2019s remarks, Ithat those votes amounted to \u201cpretend votes\u201d and would not be counted in Congress due to the existence of the. The act came into existence nearly a decade after the disputed election of 1876 \u2013 and was meant to provide a means to avoid constitutional crises where multiple elector slates from the same state are sent to be counted before Congress. Among other things, the ECA requires that if Congress receives two electoral slates, it should count the slate carrying the state\u2019s executive\u2019s signature as the rightful slate.Since all the states in question in 2020 were certified as Biden electoral votes by their respective state executives, I considered those \u201calternative\u201d votes to be purely performative, not intended to be substantive. I was wrong. It had not occurred to me that the Trump team could try to jettison the ECA and rely on Pence to unilaterally accept or reject which slates of electors were legitimate.After all, that would be akin to a self-coup. Apart from the traditional vision of a coup requiring a military takeover of the government, self-coupswhen governments depart from typical norms of democracy by altering election laws, calling into question election results or seeking to suspend their constitutions in order to stay in power.I have long been curious as to who actually participated in this plot, so I submitted a Freedom of Information Act request from National Archives. I received copies of slates of these phony electors from seven states \u2013 Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, New Mexico, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.Given the extraconstitutional nature of the scheme, I expected that most would be Trump partisans on the political fringe. Instead, most were elected party officials, political officeholders and other key figures in state Republican politics.The return addresses on the certificates included the Arizona Republican Party, the Georgia Republican Party, the Republican Party of New Mexico, the Nevada Republican Party. Michigan\u2019s came from Kathy Berden, who included the title, \u201cChair of the Michigan Republican Electoral College.\u201d Pennsylvania\u2019s was sent in by Bill Bachenberg, who referred to himself as the \u201cChairperson, Electoral College of Pennsylvania.\u201d Wisconsin\u2019s simply stated, \u201cChairperson of the Electoral College of Wisconsin.\u201d Whenby The Detroit News about why she chose to participate in this scheme, Berden said, \u201cI can\u2019t comment on anything like that. That was a long time ago.\u201d CNN reached out to Bachenberg for comment, but has not received a response.It is notable that at least a few high-profile would-be electors chose not to participate in the scheme \u2013 former US Sen. Johnny Isakson of Georgia and former Michigan Secretary of State Terri Lynn Land being the most prominent among them. In total, of 84 people across seven states, 15 chose not to participate in this effort.Still, that a majority were apparently willing to participate in such a dubious plot suggests that undemocratic efforts have been sanctioned by party regulars and will likely persist if gone unchecked.Of course, these alternate slates weren\u2019t without some glaring problems. The ECA stipulates that electoral votes should be certified by each state \u2013 accompanied with a signature by each state\u2019s executive and delivered under each state\u2019s seal. None of these alternate slates of electoral votes had a signature by a governor or a secretary of state, nor did they contain an official state seal.The alternate Michigan electors in this scheme werefrom entering the statehouse, which is where electors are required to assemble to cast their ballots by Michigan state law. In addition to falsely claiming they were the \u201cduly elected\u201d Michigan electors, the certificate that they submitted to Pence and the National Archives indicated that they signed it inside the statehouse (which they didn\u2019t).Much of the conversation around \u201calternate electors\u201d now centers on the work of one of Trump\u2019s lawyers, John Eastman, and hisfor how to overturn the results of the 2020 election. A key part of the memo had Pencealternative slates of Republican electors in seven states that Trump did not win. In spite of the ECA, Eastmanthat Pence could unilaterally determine which of the two electoral slates should be counted \u2013 or potentially discard the votes from those seven states, claim that no candidate reached a majority of electoral votes and leave the selection of the president to the House of Representatives. Contrary to what he wrote in his memo, Eastmanthe National Review last October that, \u201canybody who thinks that that\u2019s a viable strategy is crazy.\u201dUltimately, Pence did not carry out the plan offered by Eastman and championed by Trump. In handling the dueling slate of electors, he thankfully deferred to the ECA to guide his actions. Indeed, in spite of the noise created by the Big Lie about the 2020 presidential election results, every stateits election results, courtsmore than 50 election-related lawsuits and federal officials found no evidence of widespread fraud,that the election was the \u201cmost secure election in American history.\u201dHowever, given how far rogue electors in seven states went to undermine the election, it is clear further investigation and reforms are needed. First, the American people must learn who exactly was responsible for coordinating the effort to undo the 2020 elections. Identifying who organized the effort is a critical step toward accountability \u2013 both politically and legally. This underscores the important work of the January 6 committee.Second, the country does not have the luxury of waiting a decade to reform the ECA. Changes can include raising the standard to object to electoral votes, which is now set at only one senator and one House member, to a majority in both houses. Clarifying and limiting the vice president\u2019s role in the joint session is another solution that should be considered. Notably, a House committee is currentlyreform.What\u2019s clear is that lawmakers must act now to prevent a similar occurrence in the 2024 election. There appears to be bipartisanto do so, and the legitimacy of our presidential electoral system depends on it."

David Axelrod, chief strategist for former President Barack Obama\u2019s campaigns and a senior political commentator for CNN,\u00a0 hasthat in opinion polls and focus groups, concerns about the president\u2019s age is \u201cthe thing that people bring up first.\u201dTop moments from the White House Correspondents\u2019 dinnerThat\u2019s why it was an inspired move by Biden tothe issue head-on at the White House Correspondents\u2019 Association Dinner \u2014 but with a delightfully comedic touch.The president began by telling journalists and others assembled in the crowded Washington Hilton Hotel ballroom, \u201cLook, I get that. It\u2019s in everybody\u2019s mind and by everyone, I mean The New York Times.\u201d Biden then added, \u201cHeadline: \u2018Biden\u2019s advanced age is a big issue. Trump\u2019s, however, is not.\u2019 \u201dThe president doubled down on the theme,, \u201cYou might think I don\u2019t like Rupert Murdoch. That\u2019s simply not true. How can I dislike a guy who makes me look like Harry Styles?\u201d (is, of course, the dashing 29-year-old, chart-topping pop singer and Hollywood actor. Murdoch is the 92-year-oldat Fox News.)Biden was not: \u201cCall me old, I call it being seasoned. You say I am ancient, I say I\u2019m wise,\u201d he quipped, adding: \u201cYou say I\u2019m over the hill, Don Lemon would say, \u2018That\u2019s a man in his prime.\u2019 \u201d (He was referring to the former CNN anchor\u2019ssuggesting that women over 40 might have their better days behind them.)Opinion: Democrats need fresh ideas \u2013 and Biden is not the answerThe self-deprecating remarks on age started early in his speech, when Biden garnered big laughs with the: \u201cI believe in the First Amendment, not just because my good friend Jimmy Madison wrote it.\u201d (He was referring, of course, to James Madison, one of our Founding Fathers and\u2014 which was written in.)What Biden was doing was funny \u2014 but it had a serious intent: The history of presidential campaigning tells us that humor is one of the most effective ways to defuse concerns that, unaddressed, might become major campaign issues.Biden\u2019s reelection campaign (last week) is not the first time that age has been front and center in a presidential campaign. It was also the case in 1984, when President Ronald Reagan, then 73, ran for reelection against a more spry,Walter Mondale, who had been Jimmy Carter\u2019s vice president.At the time, Reagan was the oldest president in US history, andthen, much like today, raised the issue of Reagan\u2019s advanced age and mental acuity. It became even more acute after the first presidential debate in October 1984.to many who watched the debate\u00a0as.At the second presidential debate, however, Reagan was ready for the age question.The Baltimore Sun\u2019s Henry Trewhitt asked Reagan bluntly: \u201cYou already are the oldest president in history. And some of your staff say you were tired after your most recent (debating) encounter with Mr. Mondale.\u201d He then asked Reagan point-blank if he had any doubts about being able to do the job for four more years.With his response, Reagan gave one of history\u2019s most famous presidential debate lines: \u201cI want you to know,\u201d he said, \u201cthat also I will not make age an issue of this campaign. I am not going to exploit, for political purposes, my opponent\u2019s youth and inexperience.\u201dOpinion: I don\u2019t love Biden, but I\u2019m terrified of TrumpThe debate audience \u2014 and evenwith laughter. Reagan\u2019s poll,\u00a0and he went on to win reelection easily. We\u2019ll never know for sure how big a role that one-liner played, but age never again seemed a major campaign liability that could derail his reelection.A serious response to the question might have made him appear defensive. Reagan skillfully used comedy to deflect concern about his age \u2014 with stunning results.Biden should take a page from Reagan\u2019s book. He should continue what he started at the correspondents\u2019 dinner and keep it going throughout the 2024 campaign. He should own the issue of his age, using comedy to brush it to one side.This approach will show voters that Biden is not running from the issue \u2014 he\u2019d be taking it on squarely, if lightheartedly. It also affords the opportunity to put on display his mental sharpness and agility. It\u2019s a big part of why Reagan\u2019s joke went so far in apparently helping to boost his poll numbers.But finally \u2014 and here\u2019s something we all know intuitively \u2014 being funny makes a person more likable. Self-deprecating humor shows a level of security and confidence as a person. What a great contrast Biden put on display Saturday night with Donald Trump, his potential 2024 opponent.The former president\u00a0was too thin-skinned to even attend these annual comedy roasts while he was president, and heat comedians andsuch as \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d for having the temerity to mock him.There\u2019s one more thing that Biden has in common with Reagan, in addition to being advanced in age and dearly loving a good laugh. At about this same time in his first term, Reagan\u2019s approval rating was 42%, according to a. Currently, Biden\u2019s approval rating in theis about the same.Reagan went on to winin the 1984 election.\u00a0Such a result seems out of the question in today\u2019s politically polarized nation, but Biden, like Reagan, knows how to deliver a joke.And if you can get people to laugh with you, you can get them to vote for you."

The views expressed in this commentary are her own. Viewon CNN.Last month, Wisconsin held an election to fill an open seat on the State Supreme Court \u2013 the kind of local election that normally gets ignored by most people. But this year, the stakes: Whoever won this election would have a chance to set precedent on a number of hot button issues, including abortion and future legislative maps, which could potentially shape the outcome of the 2024 presidential election.At VoteAmerica, the voting engagement nonprofit that I run, we knew this election was critical for Wisconsin voters, and it was important for all voices to be represented in the election. So we tapped into our campus networks and began a massive education campaign to alert Wisconsin\u2019s college students to the stakes of the upcoming election.On 24 campuses across the state, we placed ads in newspapers and email newsletters, blanketed the campus with posters, put up billboards and partnered with student influencers. All these communications channels combined to share a simple message: Election Day was April 4.When the election results came in, it was clear that our work had been a success. Not only did, but.The city of Eau Claire\u2019s Ward 20, which covers the upper campus of the University of Wisconsin-Eau Claire,in all of Eau Claire\u2019s 77 voting wards, with votes up more than 400% over a state Supreme Court election just four years earlier. Other campus wards also showed up in impressive numbers. According to NextGen America, at one of the main polling locations for the University of Wisconsin-Madison freshmen, the vote count waswhat it had been in 2019. For VoteAmerica, this seemed like a clear win for democracy.But not everyone felt that way. Just a week and half later, Cleta Mitchell, a conservative strategist and board member for the right-leaning Bradley Foundation, was complaining about that youth turnout.Mitchell can be heard asking at a GOP retreat, \u201cWhat are these college campus locations? What is this young people effort that they do?\u201dTo Mitchell, enabling college students to vote more easily is apparently an affront. \u201cThey basically put the polling place next to the student dorm so they just have to roll out of bed, vote and go back to bed,\u201d she reportedly told donors. (Mitchell did not respond to the Washington Post\u2019s request for comment.), former Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker appeared to agree, blaming the \u201cradical indoctrination\u201d of younger voters for Republican losses.Republican-controlled states target college students\u2019 voting power ahead of high-stakes 2024 electionsMitchell and Walker aren\u2019t the only ones who have a problem with college students getting out the vote. Around the country,, with a particular focus on college voters \u2014 even though voting, and voting access, should not be seen as partisan issues.Proponents of these bills say they\u2019re just taking the necessary steps to prevent voter fraud. But perhaps we should start calling these tactics what they actually are: acts of voter suppression.To many people, the idea of college students as targets of voter suppression might sound odd. Young people, we\u2019re told, are apathetic, uninterested in showing up at the polls. Butshows that many states frequently target the youth vote \u2014 using a variation on the tactics that have long been used to suppress turnout from low-income Black and brown voters.conducted by Tufts University\u2019s Center for Information and Research on Civic Learning and Engagement (CIRCLE) found that states with the highest youth turnout had policies like automatic and same day registration. In contrast, states where youth turnout was low had more barriers, including voter ID laws and more onerous voter registration processes.Indeed, in states where an ID is required to vote, use of student IDs \u2013 sometimes the only form of identification a young person has \u2013 is, if not banned outright. In Texas,a valid form of voter identification, even if they\u2019re issued by a Texas public university. Ohiothe use of utility bills, bank statements and other documents college students often use to prove residency as a form of identification. And while Georgiaallow some student IDs to serve as voter identification, it blocks use of IDs from private universities, which puts a great burden on students from the state\u2019s private historically Black colleges and universities.Another popular tactic? Making it harder for college students to vote by limiting the number of polling places on campus \u2014 or, if a Texas proposal goes through,. Mitchell\u2019s quip about the horrors of college students being able to slip a quick vote in between naps? It\u2019s a mindset that\u2019s shaping state voting laws.Recent elections \u2013 including Wisconsin\u2019s 2023 state Supreme Court election,and the\u2013 have made it clear that young voters aren\u2019t apathetic at all. In many cases, they\u2019re simply denied the resources they need to be educated and engaged voters.When you tell young people where to vote, how to vote and what the stakes are, they have the potential to show up in droves. And that, apparently, is terrifying for many conservative politicians \u2013 perhaps because when young people do get past the many barriers to voting, theyDemocratic candidates by wide margins.There are plenty of ways to court the youth vote. Young people care about combating climate change, and are eager for innovative solutions that will protect the environment. They want to hear policy platforms that will improve job opportunity and security and make health care, including reproductive care, more accessible for everyone.But coming up with a platform that addresses these issues takes real hard work. For many politicians, it\u2019s easier to do everything they can to ensure that young people simply don\u2019t get the opportunity to vote."

He is also a former senior policy adviser to Congress\u2019 Joint Economic Committee. Follow him on. The views expressed in this piece are his own. Viewon CNN.There\u2019s afrom conservative columnist and CNN political commentator Jonah Goldberg that gets at many Americans\u2019 views toward the border: \u201cMy preferred immigration policy is that we have one.\u201dWe don\u2019t. Polls show, even, emotions when it comes to immigration. Americans take pride in being a nation of immigrants, but also tell pollsters they fear an \u201c\u201d and want clear rules for those coming to our borders to follow.In alast summer, 69% of Americans said they wanted the level of immigration to stay the same or be lowered, while 70% also agreed with the idea that immigration was a good thing for the country. Yet researchers have found migrant surges at the southern border canin public concern around the topic.That\u2019s why theof pandemic-era border closures looms so large for the White House. Trying to balance the desire for a humanitarian solution at the border with the need for structure and security is difficult in the best of times. And the impending crisis on the southern border is far from the best of times.The pandemic-era policy known asgave immigration authoritiesto turn back border crossers without giving them a chance to apply for asylum. It was admittedly a blunt-force instrument, but one that gave the US Customs and Border Patrol and other immigration enforcement a quick and easy way of keeping the system from being overloaded.Opinion: Biden needs to admit his immigration policies have failedWhen Title 42 expires on May 11, US officials are bracing for a renewed surge of immigration to border facilities. Border personnel are already experiencing an increased number of crossings. Data fromshows apprehensions and expulsions rising in a familiar seasonal pattern, with 2023 crossings above even last year\u2019s elevated levels. According to reporting by the Wall Street Journal, an estimatedare believed to be in Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez, Mexico, waiting to cross into the US after the restrictions are lifted.Border personnel will likely be faced with either operating the kinds of overcrowded facilities that the Trump administration was repeatedlyfor, or potentiallyinto the country with no court date and no guarantee they\u2019ll be found again. Either option spells political trouble.There is plenty of blame to go around when it comes to the issue of immigration, and Republicans will certainly never be ones to let a crisis, real or perceived, on the US-Mexico border go to waste. But Democrats will be left holding the hot potato if they do not treat the end of Title 42 as a substantive policy problem to be solved rather than a political optics challenge to be managed. Doing so will require them to stand up to their left-most flank.On Tuesday, the Biden administration took an initial step toward recognizing the severity of the situation by assigningto provide logistical support to border enforcement. Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas has made a rhetorical push as well. \u201cLet me be clear,\u201dlast week. \u201cOur border is not open and will not be open after May 11.\u201d Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona has also been a leading Democratic voice backing aggressivein the wake of Title 42.Opinion: The US southern border is not a threat -- it's an opportunityThe Biden administration clearly hope this quells some of the rising tensions both at the border and in Washington, DC. Many of the White House\u2019s allies, who werea similar approach when it was undertaken by the Trump White House, have held their fire, though Sen. Bob Menendez of New Jersey released asaying the \u201cmilitarization of the border is unacceptable.\u201dThe Biden administration knows it must walk a careful line. Many progressives\u2019 approach to immigration focuses on the needs and rights of migrants and asylees, and tends totoward increased enforcement, as Menendez\u2019s statement indicates. Some centrist Democrats have found political success advocating for more, but many still find themselvesbetween public opinion and their more restive progressive base.Democrats may be tempted to respond to the end of Title 42 by turning to a familiar page in their political playbooks. They may blame the border on the foibles of the, focus on the amorphous need for \u201c\u201d or try toon other policy fights.But part of the downside of winning political elections is being held accountable for what happens under your watch. And if Democrats are seen as responding to a massive wave of pressure on the southern border predominately by blamingor complaining about, they\u2019ll be rightly pilloried. Border enforcement can be done humanely, but it must be done.As evidenced by the troop deployment, the Biden administration has at least some of the tools to mitigate some of the blowback. It can ramp up border enforcement, speed up deportation proceedings and consider reviving policies like the \u201c\u201d approach. If undertaken seriously, achieving stability on the border could help send a message to the Northern Triangle countries of Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador, where many of the migrants\u2019 journeys originate, that they should stop undertaking the perilous journey.But these types of steps will require being willing to take the slings and arrows of allies on theand pro-immigration groups. And too much rhetorical focus on \u201cmaking migration more safe, orderly and humane,\u201dof Secretary of State Anthony Blinken, threatens to obscure the more short-term objective of clamping down on unauthorized entries.Larger questions of how to treat immigrants already living in the United States, and how to treat those brought to the country as minors, will continue to rack our politics. But answering those presupposes a sense of control on the southern border. If the end of Title 42 spells an unprecedented surge in border crossings and asylum claims, Democrats will not only be facing a short-term political loss, but a dynamic that threatens any longer-term bargains over immigration reform as well."

        "text": "Editor\u2019s Note:When King Charles rumbles up the road from Buckingham Palace in his horse drawn carriage on May 6, off to his coronation, I will be nearby, protesting for the abolition of the British monarchy.I will be joined\u00a0by\u00a0many\u00a0other protesters, each of us determined to do two things: show the world Britain isn\u2019t a nation of royalists and tell the British people it\u2019s time we brought this nonsense to an end.The monarchy is always wrong in principle and is no good in practice. The support it has had until recently was sustained by the Queen,\u00a0byand by(the Royal Household is exempt from Freedom of Information requests).That support is now falling. According to a recent,\u00a0support for abolition \u2013 that is, Britain having an elected head of state \u2013 is close to a third. Even more so for young people under 35 years, where it\u2019s almost half.Importantly,\u00a0most peopleAfter a string of scandals \u2013 from(the Royal Household maintains that it complies with the provisions of the Equality Act)\u00a0to the(who has continually denied allegations of sexual abuse) \u2013 the monarchy is now reduced to an uninspiring\u00a0quartet: Charles and Camilla, William and Kate. These are not people to turn around those falling polls.Opinion: The Kings\u2019 coronation is a rare moment of togethernessBut while it is almost certainly the case that in Charles we have a head of state who would lose a free and fair election, opposition to the monarchy isn\u2019t about the royals. Yes, in my view the monarchy is, guilty ofand, albeit legitimized by the government.But more profound concerns lie behind the growing push for a republic. It is about recognizing the strength of democratic ideals and the failures of Britain\u2019s own democracy. It\u2019s about democratic reform that leaves no room for hereditary power and privilege.The monarchy not only forces us to compromise our values, to make intellectual room for hereditary public office and for an institution\u2013\u00a0it fails to deliver or defend a democratic culture or constitution.Quite the opposite, the monarchy is the wellspring of so much that\u2019s wrong with our politics. The Crown is the source of.\u00a0The courts exercise their power in the name of the Crown, as do government ministers.Over the past\u00a0300\u00a0years the powers of the monarch have simply been passed on to the government, allowing them to declare war, sign treaties and control parliament. Power is highly\u00a0centralized,\u00a0the government largely free to do as it pleases with.It is telling that royalists so often reduce the argument to economic costs and benefits, as more serious arguments never favor the monarchy. They may say monarchy defends us against tyranny, but this is palpably false. Yet so arewhich. According to research by my organization, there is no profit from the monarchy,.Cost to our nation\u2019s finances, certainly, but also to our democratic values and how our democracy plays out in practice.A parliamentary republic by contrast\u00a0would\u00a0give us checks and balances, disperse power between government, parliament and people and an accountable head of state \u2013 one of us who can genuinely represent us.Not running the government but guarding our constitution. It\u2019s a model which works well across Europe, most notably in Ireland.So, when we\u00a0shout\u00a0\u201cNot My King!\u201d\u00a0at Charles, it is a proud statement of democratic principle \u2013 that we recognise no person\u2019s claim to be above us because of birth. Instead, we demand a democracy that celebrates our noblest principles and greatest endeavours.On May 6 it\u2019s about saying very clearly, we want an election instead of a coronation, and a choice instead of Charles."

For, they have been held periodically to give prelates all over the world a chance to meet and discuss the major challenges facing the church.At the conclusion of the multi-day confabs, bishops present proposals to the pope. The pope then digests the proposals and produces a document that may incorporate some of their views if he agrees with them.Women have been present at these meetings, serving as. But the limited participation of women in synods has rankled female Catholics for many years. At the same time, sincea Synod of Bishops, with voting limited to ordained men, they largely tolerated their diminished voice.But in 2018, Francisto give the vote to two male members of the Franciscan order who were not ordained. The reason for the exception to the ordained-only rule? That the Franciscans were an important and historic order \u2013 an explanation that did not appease Catholic sisters, who took toto change the church\u2019s mind. It was obvious that women were not given the right to vote specifically because of their gender.Pope to allow women to vote at global bishops meetingThe gender barrier came down gradually. In 2021, Francis named, Sister Nathalie Becquart, to a post overseeing the synod. Her appointment gave her the right to vote. Now, it seems, the Vatican got the point that maybe one vote wasn\u2019t enough.Asked why the church was giving the right to vote to more women, Synod bossreplied, \u201cbecause that is the way our world is.\u201dBeing voting members, even if outnumbered, means women\u2019s voices will be heard and will count for something. It will make a difference not only at this synod, but at future synods, when the church will continue to grapple with major issues such as the future of the family, care for the planet and social justice, as well as the church\u2019s struggles with the ongoing crisis of child abuse.And while Francis hasthe door on the ordination of women to the priesthood, a future synod could reconsider that.The morality of artificial birth control and the church\u2019s views on abortion would be enriched if women played a significant role in future synods and had a sizable vote.The Women\u2019s Ordination Conference, which lfor voting rights, has hailed the pope\u2019s decision as atowards \u201cgreater co-responsibility and equity between women and men at the synod.\u201dAt the current Synod, having the votes of women might make the most impact on the issue of ordaining women to the diaconate, as is now. Deaconspreach at Mass, baptize people and witness and bless marriages, though they can\u2019t say Mass or hear confessions as priests can.Given theof priests in many parts of the world, and the evidence of women deacons in the early church, a decision to ordain women deaconsto Catholic women, writes historian Phyllis Zagano.But when you do the math, the results suggest that these women\u2019s votes will have little sway \u2013 and that it would be wise to resist any temptation to see this as a watershed that will give faithful Catholic women the role in the church that they deserve.When you do the math, the results suggest that these women\u2019s votes will have little sway \u2013 and that it would be wise to resist any temptation to see this as a watershed that will give faithful Catholic women the role in the church that they deserve.Celia WexlerThe Vatican\u2019s decision calls for half of the 70 \u201cnon-bishops\u201d \u2013 out of about 370 voting Synod participants \u2013 to be women. So, 35 women voting in this group. And then throw in anothervotes from women who represent female religious congregations who previously didn\u2019t have the right to vote. Forty female votes is a little under 11%!Even Cardinal Grechthat the revised rules constituted \u201can important change\u201d but were \u201cnot a revolution.\u201dAnd keep in mind that clerics will run the show when it comes to choosing these female voters. Conferences of bishops throughout the worldof 140 potential women voters.That means in the United States, the US Conference of Catholic Bishops, that bastion of conservatism,the choosing. Not very encouraging for us Americans. In nations where bishops are more progressive, things may be better. Of those nominated, the pope will choose the 35 sent to speak for the fairer sex.The only other requirement the pope has made is that these groups include. I\u2019m all for millennials. But what does that mean for the women who have dedicated their lives to the cause of greater inclusion of women in the life of the church?Will Zagano, who has written extensively about the role of women deacons in the early church, be given a vote? How about British theologian, who has worked tirelessly to amplify women\u2019s voices in the church?In 2014, Beattie founded, an international group of women focused on one goal: increasing women\u2019s participation in the life and governance of the church.Four years later, at the same time bishops were meeting to discuss the role of young people in the church, BeattieCatholic women \u2013 including me \u2013 from all over the world to air their views in a day-long symposium.The next day, many of us joined her in aoutside the gates of the Vatican. \u201cKnock, knock who\u2019s there? More than half the church,\u201d we chanted. Hardly a call to arms, particularly since we also sang hymns. Nevertheless, the Roman police were called.It was frightening and intimidating as the cops initially asked for passports. One officer was on horseback, and was particularly hostile. Another tightly grabbed the arm of one of the protest leaders, a petite young woman who was visibly shaken by the incident.Representation is a lot better than getting arrested, and it\u2019s unlikely women will be accosted by police when the Synod on Synodality meets this October.But it\u2019s difficult to believe that the presence of a few women, chosen by the hierarchy, will really make a difference. Women will need a lot more votes to wield real power in the church."

        "text": "Editor\u2019s Note:As a teenager, I was in favor of scrapping the monarchy for a republic. That had seemed simple common sense, at first. Why should the highest role in the land only be open to those who were born to it?My\u00a0parents came to the UK from Ireland and India \u2013 both became republics after securing their independence from Britain.Maybe I figured that,\u00a0ifwasn\u2019t going to be a republican, who on earth was?Fast forward a few decades and I will be one of those watching the coronation. I have changed my mind about the monarchy.The coronation of King Charles\u00a0is an important moment in history, part of a tradition that stretches back almost a thousand years \u2013 and the first time that most of us, everybody under 70, will get to witness this ceremony.So why did I change my mind?Realizing that most people did not\u00a0seem to\u00a0agree with my teenage self, I tried to think about why that was. A \u201cdemocratic monarchy\u201d may sound like a paradox \u2013 but a \u201cconstitutional monarchy\u201d\u00a0like ours\u00a0does have democratic legitimacy,\u00a0as long as it retains broad public consent.Opinion: We want a choice instead of CharlesOpponents often say this reflects pro-royal propaganda and media bias. But I don\u2019t find the idea that the public\u00a0is\u00a0duped into supporting the monarchy convincing.And the pro-republic case is\u00a0too much a\u00a0rational\u00a0tidying-up exercise \u2013 removing something distinctive about Britain, to make us that little bit more like everywhere else.I also came to think of our symbolic monarchy as largely harmless. It does not determine big questions \u2013 like Brexit or Scottish independence.The intuition\u00a0that it may\u00a0legitimize\u00a0inequality\u00a0seems weaker if you realize that some of the most equal societies \u2013 like Sweden \u2013 have monarchies,\u00a0while some of the most unequal \u2013\u2013 are republics.More recently, after a decade of stark political polarization, there should be\u00a0less emphasis on seeing the institution as a harmless symbolic decoration \u2013 and\u00a0more\u00a0on how it can be\u00a0socially useful.The monarchy\u2019s limited constitutional role is fixed, but its civic role can evolve.In a fast-changing society, symbols of tradition can be important sources of reassurance, especially if there is a proactive effort to reach across society.Sunder KatwalaIn an individualistic, somewhat fragmented era, there are not many things \u2013 beyond the biggest sporting events and major royal occasions \u2013 when 20 million of us are paying attention to the same thing. We should not give up lightly on one of the few\u00a0things\u00a0that we have in common.Rituals and moments that we share matter. In our free society, how people engage will be about choice, not compulsion.In a fast-changing society, symbols of tradition can be important sources of reassurance, especially if there is a proactive effort to reach across society.The monarchy could be particularly important in a Britain of rising ethnic and faith diversity. That is reflected in the King\u2019s desire to balance being head of the established church with articulating his sense of an additional duty to protect the diversity of this country.The King may have a challenge now to reach across the generations.\u00a0Many among the first generation of Commonwealth migrants to Britain\u00a0in the decades after 1948\u00a0spoke of their identification with the Queen.The Queen was less a symbol of the fading empire she was born into, than the Commonwealth links that she championed.\u00a0That commitment to the Commonwealth signaled that she recognized the history that explained their presence here. She knew why Britain\u2019s ethnic minorities were British.Younger British-born generations from both majority and minority groups may prove harder to reach. But a bridging Crown should make that effort.A constitutional monarchy needs broad consent, not universal acclaim. Thewho would get rid of the monarchy should get a fairer share of voice than they did during last Autumn\u2019s mourning period.After all,\u00a0democratic\u00a0dissent is not disorder. We should try to disagree well about the monarchy: the debate about why people want to keep it, to reform it, perhaps gradually, or even replace it illuminates ideas about who we are and who we want to be.Everybody should be invited to engage with this national occasion in whatever way feels right to them."

The opinions expressed in this commentary are her own. Readon CNN.As a recent immigrant to the United States, I am sometimes on the receiving end of compassionate efforts as people offer me their condolences for having arrived to the US as a student, no less, during such an economically tumultuous time. They\u2019re not wrong\u2014if my American and green-card-holder friends have anecdotally commented on how hard it is to find a job right now, us visa-less hopefuls are at theof the labor market food chain.In the past 12 months, prices in the US have risen at a brisk pace, a level most Americans \u2013 and the Federal Reserve Bank \u2013 consider far too high.\u00a0But for me, despite the gloom of economists, the sun shines just as brightly, spring smells just as sweetly and I wake up just as grateful to live in a country with 5% inflation.That\u2019s because I\u2019m from Buenos Aires, Argentina. The mention of my country makes people think of\u00a0wine, steak and Lionel Messi (or Diego Maradona, depending on who you\u2019re asking and how old they are). And while these may indeed be national treasures, to most Argentines our country\u00a0is also associated\u00a0with\u00a0a history of severe economic crises.Compared to Argentina, the US has nothing to worry about.5 ways to inflation-proof your finances in 2023, according to expertsJust last month, annual inflation in Argentinafor the first time since 1991, when the country was recuperating from 3,000%. Consumer prices rose 102.5% in March as the economymuch more than expected despite a glorious win in the Qatar World Cup in December.The government is on itssince July and isto stay up to date with the conditions set by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for its($44 billion). Inflation is so severe that some people have been papering their walls with 10-peso bills because it\u2019s cheaper than buying. Evenwas stumped when trying to analyze Argentina\u2019s economy.If this wasn\u2019t enough, two statistics put it even more bluntly. Since the 1950s, Argentina has spent more time in a recession thanexcept for the Democratic Republic of the Congo. And if you were, like me, born on or after the year 2000 in Argentina, you\u2019ve never lived without.Anyone who steps foot in Argentina has to deal with less-than-alluring hassles. There arefor the US dollar (including an exclusive rate for concerts called \u201c,\u201d probably due to that being the only band that dares make) and you must always and only\u00a0be\u00a0carrying $100 bills (they have\u00a0a bitthan $20s or, God forbid, $5s) because the peso has virtually no value. You must also be prepared to deal with a fluctuating dollar exchange rate. Because the government has a, it has exchange controls in place to prevent. This policy gave birth to the infamous \u201c,\u201d the illegal and popular parallel dollar rate which has no purchasing limit. When I first submitted this article last week, the dollar blue was at $408 pesos to the dollar. Today, it has.What was it like growing up with economic chaos as an intrinsic part of my life?\u00a0As early as primary school, I understood inflation\u2014something most adult Americans. My friends and I had a running bet of guessing what the price of our recess snacks would be the next week. I, having the most expensive taste, was 12 the first time my $10 peso bill couldn\u2019t buy my favorite, which I still remember once purchasing with coins. This made asking our parents for cash almost a daily habit\u2014so much so that we often felt guilty at our parents\u2019 disbelief that we were still asking for more. How could typical teenage activities like going to the movies or to a party cost so much and increase so often?UK inflation stays at 10% as bread rises at record clip. Here\u2019s why it\u2019s proving hard to beatWe quickly understood the very real consequences our country\u2019s economy could have on our lifestyle. We grew up discussing school, dating and politics, and often the latter way more than the others. For many of us, awareness of the feeble thread our economic security rested upon instilled a hustler\u2019s mentality. In my case, after two years of private tutoring, I was paying for my own trip to Europe at 18.Since the government limits purchasing dollars toat the official rate, when traveling abroad most people head to offices that act as a front for the illegal exchange market, also known as, to get their money\u2019s worth.The first time I went to one was to change my hard-earned dollars into euros. My friends and I had spent weeks closely following the exchange rates and talking to friends of friends to figure out what was the ideal date (especially if it was close to an election) and location to go to.I found myself in the cobblestone streets of Microcentro in Buenos Aires\u2014most accurately described by this TripAdvisor: \u201cIt\u2019s better not to go\u2026\u201d You would never have guessed that that\u2019s where theonce stood as you made a beeline for the so-called jewelry store closely hugging your coat and not making eye-contact with any of the characters that roam the streets. While officially illegal, the underground economy is so ubiquitous that the policemen escorted me to a cab on my way out\u2014for a bribe, of course.Living in a country that has, for virtually the last century, been in sociopolitical and economic turmoil shapes a person. Our minds are not structured for permanence. We live in a constant state of uncertainty, always needing to be a few steps ahead of the next ridiculous policy that will send our lives into turmoil.But for all the stress and frustration it entailed, the constant state of economic instability made me an incredibly adaptable person, and I wouldn\u2019t change that for the world. It\u2019s what\u2019s allowed me to move from Buenos Aires to Edinburgh to Michigan to New York, to make friends from scratch three times in my adult life and to be savvy in choosing what opportunities to pursue. Because when you don\u2019t take anything for granted, you\u2019re always awake, aware, alive.If you\u2019re currently struggling with the inflation rates in the US, my story is not meant to make you feel bad just because other people have it worse. It\u2019s meant to make you feel hopeful that you\u2019ll weather the storm. Reality for Argentines is always a constant struggle. You never work or save or hustle enough to be done with it, but you never stop trying either. And whether it\u2019s getting the internship of your dreams or working as a server until 1 a.m. (both of which I\u2019ve done), you have no idea where the next opportunity will take you."

        "text": "Editor\u2019s Note:Emmeline Ha, MD is a family physician and Miriam Bukhsh, MD is an emergency physician. They are health policy fellows at the George Washington University Department of Emergency Medicine. The opinions expressed in this commentary are their own. Read moreon CNN.Health care workers vividly remember the anxiety surrounding mask access in the early days of the pandemic. Thewere so severe that it was an all-too-common occurrence to walk into work, only to find that there were no available N95 respirators in your size.Hospitals did their best to come up with solutions to circumvent this shortage \u2013 including recommending repetitive use, performing ultraviolet light cleanings of used masks and simply rationing \u2013 but we still remember the stress of feeling physically under-protected.Thankfully, as we enter year three of the pandemic, access to masks in the health care setting has improved. However, the Omicron variant has led to some of the highestsince the start of the pandemic and many states are utilizing greater thanof their inpatient and intensive care unit beds. The rapidly infectious nature of Omicron has made many public health leaders reconsider thefor the general public.On Friday, the CDCfor preventing the spread of Covid-19. The agency provided additional information about the various types of masks that are available and in which circumstances each type is appropriate. Overall, it is recommended that individuals wear masks that \u201cfit well\u201d and that they will \u201cwear consistently,\u201d with the understanding that higher quality masks like N95s and KN95s will offer more protection than a simple cloth mask if worn correctly.What Justice Gorsuch's masklessness says about societyWhile higher quality masks provide better protection, multiple barriers prevent widespread public use of them. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) specifies that, when masks are required in the workplace, those masks must be approved by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH). This has led to false marketing of non-NIOSH-approved masks and prompted the CDC to publish a guide onOnthe prices for 20 N95s range from $27-$124. In addition to quality misrepresentation and financial limitations, proper size and fitting of these masks can vary from person to person.President Joe Biden announced Thursday that his administration would make high-quality masksfor Americans. Also last week, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sandersto provide three N95 masks to every American using the United States Postal Service for distribution and additional pick-up sites at community locations. While these are promising steps for increasing mask access, we strongly urge officials to value local partnerships in their initiatives.Ifand thehave taught us anything, it is that we need to be proactive in ensuring equitable access to these masks. While the administration hasthat the masks will be available at some local pharmacies and community centers, it will be critical to ensure that sufficient supply is available to those who have high risk exposure to the virus.For example, those who work outside of the home and interact with others may need more masks than those who work from home. In addition, if the method of signing up for free masks is similar to the current federal government\u2019sthat went up Tuesday, individuals with broadband access issues and limited English proficiency may be unable to navigate these services.We, therefore, recommend the following three venues for mask distribution that will address both equitable access and effective use.Counterfeit N95 masks are everywhere. Here's how to spot themThe first location is in established areas where people are already receiving medical care. These include the community centers and pharmacies that the administration has noted will be distribution spots, but the list should extend to primary care clinics, hospitals, medical and dental centers, Covid-19 vaccination sites and Covid-19 testing centers. By partnering with local places that the general public regularly uses and trusts with their health, effective education and prevention can be achieved. Ain Maryland is already pursuing this method and will soon be distributing high-quality masks at state-run testing and vaccination sites.The second location is the workplace. Individual companies could put in requests for masks based on their number of employees. Given that a \u201chigh-quality\u201d mask is one that is not wet or soiled, organizations would have to assess the likelihood of mask reusability depending upon the task the employee is hired to do and request masks for more frequent changing if needed.Especially after the recentblocking the general workplace vaccine mandate, masks can be a line of protection for vulnerable populations while at work. In Los Angeles, employers are alreadyto provide well-fitting medical-grade masks to employees who work indoors in close contact with others.The third location that would benefit from high-quality mask distribution is schools. We have argued in the past that school mask mandates play anin fighting the spread of this virus. For younger children who are not yet eligible for the vaccine or whose household members are immunocompromised or unvaccinated, high-quality masks may be their primary source of protection during the school day.There areand only certain KN95s and medical-grade surgical masks are made to fit children. Given the difficulties in purchasing these masks (including costs and supply availability), school partnerships would provide more equitable access. The number of masks needed could be identified through school rosters and then allocated appropriately. States like Colorado have been distributing free at-home Covid-19 testing kits throughSimilar processes to this can be used to plan for mask distribution.Compared to the early days of limited personal protective equipment, we have made great strides. When the administration releases their plans for mask distribution this week, we hope they take into account the lessons learned thus far from the pandemic. By distributing high-quality masks directly to the public where they are at, we can maximize protection against the SARS-CoV-2 virus \u2013 balancing equitable access and effective use for all."

        "text": "Editor\u2019s Note:As Russian forces fled a Ukrainian advance in occupied Kherson late last year, their behavior became synonymous with industrial-scale theft.The troops seized Ukrainian,\u00a0lootedand even loadedonto their tanks.In a surreal twist, footage appeared of one hulking soldier crowded into a child-sized, driving it away in the midst of a Russian convoy.Sadly, bizarre images like this aren\u2019t unique to Russia\u2019s 2022 invasion.Writing in 1914, historian Marian DubieckiMoscow\u2019s deportation of Polish children following the 18century.\u00a0He noted that Russian officers \u201cdid not hesitate to take loot for themselves even from children\u2019s toys.\u201dOver the course of Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine,. Few though, are\u00a0more devastating than the mass trafficking of children.In the summer of 2022, a disturbingappeared in occupied Mariupol depicting a Russian soldier holding a small, bewildered Ukrainian child draped in a Russian flag. The Russian soldier stands triumphantly on the bloody remains of a Ukrainian man, presumably the child\u2019s father.Yet again, it seems Moscow is using\u00a0stolen children to punish opposition to their violent control.Over the course of the war, at leasthave been forcibly transferred from their families in Ukraine to Russia or\u00a0Russian-occupied territories, according to Ukrainian officials.Opinion: A chilling insight into life for deported Ukrainian childrenThese callous crimes against children have resulted in the International Criminal Court issuingfor Russia\u2019s so-called \u201cChildren\u2019s Rights\u201d Commissionerand\u00a0President Vladimir Putin \u2013 only the third-serving president in history to be issued one.While the forced deportations have stunned global observers, from a historical perspective Russia\u2019s policy against Ukrainian civilians\u00a0is terribly logical and consistent.Moscow has regularly used mass trafficking of citizens, including,\u00a0over: to punish resisters, weaken community ties that could threaten the state and solve their ownRussia\u2019s pronounced\u00a0demographic crisis\u00a0has been well-known for years, and fears abound that children are viewed by the Kremlin as another resource to loot.Russia\u2019s workforce challenges are profound, with many thousands of military casualties and out-migration. With scores of deported Ukrainian children and adults sent toin Russia\u2019s poorest regions, patterns of Soviet forcible worker resettlement campaigns raise concerns of willful, coordinated\u00a0labor trafficking.The durability of this\u00a0strategy also\u00a0provides fresh insight into the staunch support of Ukraine\u2019s neighbors who suffered under similar policies. Poland, for example, has frequentlythe Western military alliance to provide more, better and faster weapons to Ukraine.Less commonly known is how the waves of hauntingly familiar mass deportations of Polish children shape the nation\u2019s staunch support of Ukraine.Historians\u00a0describe, after an uprising against the Russian Empire, as subjecting \u201cthe children\u2019s world\u2026 to terrible devastation.\u201dThe artist Piotr Michaelczewski (1807-1886) later captured another Moscow-directed mass deportation in his\u00a0haunting,\u00a0\u201cAbduction of Polish Children in Warsaw by Muscovites in 1831.\u201dWho would have imagined that centuries later,\u00a0International Criminal Court President\u00a0Piotr Hofma\u0144ski\u00a0\u2013 himself of Polish nationality \u2013 would read aloud arrest warrants echoing these very crimes against Ukraine\u2019s children.Beyond intimidating parents, Moscow authorities haveoperated for centuries from the belief that children can be \u201cre-educated\u201d to forget their families, deny their communities and forsake their identity for ideological loyalty to the state.In one 1864, an elderly man recounted that his only childhood memories were Polish songs, slowly realizing for the first time his childhood deportation to distant regions in Russia.\u00a0 Such children were completely immersed in Russian society, losing their native language, culture and memories.More recently,of rescued Ukrainian children recount extensive ideological coercion, often violent, while in Russian custody.One young teenagerhis group of captive children were forced to acknowledge a statue with the inscription \u201cPutin is king\u201d and sing the Russian national anthem to \u201cearn\u201d basic necessities like food and the opportunity to shower. Other forms of physical and sexualadd terrible urgency to rescuing each child.Beyond intimidating parents, Moscow authorities have consistently\u00a0operated for centuries from the belief that children can be \u2018re-educated\u2019 to forget their families, deny their communities, and forsake their identity for ideological loyalty to the state.Kristina Hook and Oleksandra GaidaiRussian perpetrators now demonstrate radicalization dynamicsto genocide scholars, and their dehumanizing ire has turned toward Ukrainian children.One\u00a0state TV\u00a0pundit openlyabout drowning or burning Ukrainian children. (He was suspended from RT for the comments. Though a Russian investigative committee later foundby the TV host).Elsewhere, another Russian legislator joked aboutto Ukrainian children as\u00a0their Christmas\u00a0gift.In rescued children\u2019s testimonies, a frightening\u00a0level of anger by their Russian captors emerges, with specialreserved for\u00a0kids\u00a0who speak Ukrainian, wear colors associated with their national identity or deny the superiority of Russian identity.Children are falsely told that their families have abandoned them and that they are \u201c\u201d forever.The small number of children rescued,, has involved the tireless work of contacts across Ukraine and\u00a0Russia. But\u00a0all-too-many cases rely upon individual circumstances, luck and the incredibleof the children themselves.These obstacles must not deter a global pressure campaign.Beyond the current ICC arrest warrants, more trafficking perpetrators must be publicly indicted and sanctioned. Wider networks involved in this mass kidnapping scheme must be\u00a0targeted, including Russian administrators of adoption services, ideological re-education, transport and logistics.Presently, the Ukrainian government, NGOs,\u00a0and private citizens work hard to bring Ukraine\u2019s children home,\u00a0with even journalistsone daring rescue of two teenage girls.Yet resource constraints exist. Wider financial and technical anti-trafficking support from the more than 150 UN Genocide, as well as UN agencies inside Russia like UNHCR and UNICEF, are needed. Secure communications for deported Ukrainians (and those whothem) are a practical first step.Finally, legal support for the families of trafficked children, as well as continued military aid to secure Ukrainian civilian safety and prevent future deportations, must remain global priorities.Every day brings fresh evidence of Russia\u2019s weaponization ofto terrorize Ukrainian civilians.But through such steps, the centuries-old cycle of Moscow\u2019s mass kidnappings of children can finally be broken."

        "link": "https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/03/opinions/fed-interest-rates-banking-crisis-zandi/index.html",
        "text": "Editor\u2019s Note:The Federal Reserve is gearing up for another interest rate hike on Wednesday. That would be a mistake. After an astonishing year of rate increases, it\u2019s time for the Fed to pause.The Fed misjudged and waited too long to begin normalizing interest rates coming out of the pandemic. The result was runaway inflation. It\u2019s unfair to be very critical given the extraordinary uncertainties that Covid-19 and Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine created. However, if Fed officials misjudge again and keep pushing up rates and precipitate a recession, that will be on them.The Fed rightly sees reining in inflation as its number one priority, but it is moderating., which peaked at 9% on a year-over-year basis lastbut has slowed to 5% this March, is expected to be just over 3% by the end of this year, according to Moody\u2019s Analytics, and at the Fed\u2019s 2% target by spring 2024. Yes, this is an uncertain forecast, but it is more certain than it has been since inflation took off.Most certain is the throttling back of growth in the,\u00a0theof most household budgets. Housing costs tie back to,\u00a0which have\u00a0a long lag given the many leases that renew only annually. Rents\u00a0surged when the economy reopened as more households started renting, pandemic-related supply chain and labor supply problems limited the supply of new rentals and. That translated into strong growth in housing costs.However, in recent months,have begun to decline on average; rental supply has picked up as supply chains and labor supply normalize. A record number ofwill be completed this year. There is also demand destruction: Even though rents have started declining, they are still too expensive for many potential households, and those households can\u2019t form, with young people opting to continue living at home. Weaker rents will translate into much slower growth in housing costs in coming months.Opinion: If you think the US has it bad, look to ArgentinaCar and truck\u00a0prices that have surged since the pandemic hit are also set to fall. Prices have been fueled globally by weak new vehicle production, particularly inand, due to pandemic-related supply chain problems. With inventories on dealers\u2019 lots depleted,took off.are up even more as the limited supply of new vehicles results in fewer used ones.But with supply chains finally up and running after China ended its zero-Covid policy earlier this year and global producers adjust to the disruptions caused by Russia\u2019s war with Ukraine,is picking up\u00a0and inventories are building. Competitive pressures will soon kick in, so manufacturers and dealers will offer bigger incentives and reduced prices.Most difficult to gauge is the persistence of inflation for services not related to housing. This so-calledreflects price increases in a range of labor-intensive service industries such as health care, hospitality and personal services. The Fed is especially focused on supercore, which most clearly reflects labor costs that monetary policy can influence as higher interest rates weigh on labor demand.Supercore inflation remains uncomfortably high, but the trend lines are encouraging. The Fed\u2019s aggressive rate hikes are starting to weaken, and businesses are pulling back on hiring. In fact, my own analysis shows that labor demand has fallen below labor supply for the first time since the pandemic shutdowns. Most telling is thathas peaked, and while still too strong to be consistent with the Fed\u2019s inflation target, it isn\u2019t too far off.When it contemplates more rate hikes, the Fed would be wise to put more weight on ensuring the banking system is on sound footing. The banking crisis that swept the nation since mid-March has been quelled, but only because of the government\u2019s muscular intervention, including the emergency liquidity the Fed provided to the banks and takeover of the most troubled banks. It is incongruous for the Fed to help banks raiseat the same time it is raising rates, which is also raising the cost of that funding.But while the, the economic fallout has only begun. Chastened banks with constrained liquidity and diminished capital will batten down the hatches. They\u2019re going to ratchet up, which were already tightening significantly. The tightening will be most pronounced for especially risky commercial real estate and commercial and industrial loans to businesses., reliant on small and mid-sized banks for credit, will suffer most.Inflation is headed back to the Fed\u2019s target with increasing certainty. The job market is easing. The banking system is fragile. This all means the Fed should pause its rate hikes. Investors are even pricing in a significant easing inbeginning this summer. Indeed, that would be consistent with the dour forecasts of the Fed\u2019s own economists. According to theof the March Federal Open Market Committee meeting, Fed staff economists now project a mild recession starting later this year.I\u2019m not as bleak, but to skirt a recession, the Fed must pause its rate hikes. It probably won\u2019t kill the economy if the Fed increases rates. But why take that risk?"

He is the author of \u201c,\u201d and is at work on a book investigating foreign lobbying in Washington. The views expressed in this article are his own. Readat CNN.SomeUS lawmakersto Secretary of State Antony Blinken last week, urging the Biden administration to press Russia for the release of imprisoned dissident Vladimir Kara-Murza.That correspondence probably won\u2019t prompt Russian President Vladimir Putin to free his longtime critic, but it just might help cast a spotlight on the plight of Kara-Murza, which deserves far more international attention than it has generally received.Much public notice justifiably has been paid in recent months to other individuals who have been unjustly imprisoned by Putin\u2019s ruthless regime. The outrageous detention last month ofhas prompted vocal demands for his release from his employer and from the US State Department and generated international headlines.Meanwhile, andocumentary has called attention to the terrible plight of imprisoned opposition leader, whoseis cause of grave concern.this week, he wrote that his situation may even be worsening, saying that Russian authorities told him they areon terrorism charges that could mean decades more in prison.While the West must continue to call for the release of those two high-profile political prisoners, it should not overlook Kara-Murza. Although he is respected for his work as aand has been honored with the\u2013 reaction to his plight as a Russian prisoner has seemed strangely muted.Russian authorities charged Kara-Murza with treason in October 2022, after being detained in April of that year. His arresthe gave the previous month to the Arizona House of Representatives in which he called out Western \u201cappeasement\u201d of Putin. After a, a Russian court sentenced him earlier this month to a staggering 25 years in prison, themeted out to a government critic since Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine last year.Opinion: How Putin\u2019s \u2018cat\u2019s paw\u2019 sunk into SudanSince his arrest, thefresh sanctions against Russian nationals. And last month, the USandDepartments announced a number of sanctions against those involved in Kara-Murza\u2019s prosecution and detention, accusing them of \u201cserious human rights abuse[s].\u201d But the response elsewhere has been surprisingly lackluster \u2013 especially by the United Kingdom Kara-Murza is a citizen of Britain, in addition to holding a Russian passport.Last week, after months of seeming inaction, the British governmentKara-Murza\u2019s conviction and sentencing. It announceds against various individuals it accused of having a hand in his detention and prosecution, as well as two FSB security service agents it said played a role in his.\u201cThe UK will continue to support Mr. Kara-Murza and his family. I call on Russia to release him immediately and unconditionally,\u201d Foreign Secretary James Cleverly said in a statement announcing the sanctions.But in various public statements, including in an interview with the BBC, Kara-Murza\u2019s wife Evgeniathat it took a draconian prison sentence against her husband to spur London to act.\u201cIt only saddens me that it took a year of unlawful detention, a horrific sentence of 25 years in a strict regime and a very concerning deterioration of my husband\u2019s health for the British government to move to a somewhat stronger response,\u201d Evgenia Kara-Murzathe British broadcaster.London\u2019s less-than-robust response points to a disheartening problem: An apparent lack of coordination among Western allies in responding to the incarceration of such a prominent opposition figure, as Russia lurches toward totalitarianism.The Biden administration launched its \u201c\u201d campaign aimed at highlighting the plight of political prisoners \u2013 including Kara-Murza \u2013 around the world. US lawmakers in the US Congress have issued a range of congressionalandhighlighting\u00a0 Kara-Murza\u2019s plight.Russia\u2019s Alexey Navalny says he faces new terrorism charges despite being in prisonBut efforts to call attention to the plight of those who are unjustly imprisoned and to undertake concerted action to help them have been, at best, scattershot. The disjointed Western response to Kara-Murza\u2019s plight only works to Russia\u2019s advantage.After more than a year of war, certain Russian officials and various oligarchs have been sanctioned by certain Western governments while others are not \u2013 a helter-skelter response which helps only them. And even when sanctions are applied, they don\u2019t always seem to have the desired effect, as we learned this week amid headlines about a Russian deputy defense minister whose socialite former wife apparently is\u2013 even though her ex-husband has been sanctioned.It\u2019s long past time to create a coordinating body to ensure that Western sanctions packages are aligned and airtight. Al for a Trans-Atlantic Anti-Corruption Council lays out the perfect\u00a0 framework for such a body. It would bring together officials and experts to further align anti-corruption policy on both sides of the Atlantic, and is precisely what\u2019s needed if America, Britain, the European Union and Canada are to present a unified front on the sanctions regime.We know that the threat of being sanctionedin the heart of Russian officials and oligarchs. It\u2019s possible that they recalled a similar case from over a decade ago, after the imprisonment and death in custody of Russian figure Sergei Magnitsky. That led US lawmakers to pass the well-known and broadly successful 2012 \u201c\u201d sanctions program which Russians came to revile.The law was signed by then-President Barack Obama as a retaliation against the human rights abuses suffered by Magnitsky, a Russian lawyer and auditor who discovered hundreds of millions of dollars in graft and fraud involving the Kremlin. Magnitsky, who was arrested without charge after blowing the whistle, ultimately died during his detention under suspicious circumstances.A 2016 measure, the, expanded on the original law, and has succeeded in targetingof corrupt individuals and entities around the world since its enactment, according to the US government. A number ofhave also passed their own versions of the Magnitsky Act.Somehow it seems \u2013 despite all the attention Moscow has drawn over the past year for its invasion of Ukraine and the increasingly authoritarian leadership of President Vladimir Putin \u2013 that the West still treads gingerly with the Russian dictator, even amid his egregious human rights abuses and blatant violations of international law.The US senators have gestured at least toward trying to help Kara-Murza, a man who had survived two poisonings suspected to have been carried out by the Russian regime, and who as a result has.The letter by US lawmakers is a small step, but it is at very least, a start. Washington should now follow it up with more robust action, including declaring Kara-Murza \u201cwrongfully detained.\u201dThe US government should encourage Western allies to take similar stringent measures against Putin\u2019s regime and to pledge to improve coordination on sanctions moving forward. It might yield results in the form of fewer detained dissidents \u2013 and could even lead to the long-overdue freedom from prison for Kara-Murza."

Ukraine has announced repeatedly that it\u2019s planning, a push to retake Ukrainian territory captured by the Russian occupiers.Russia\u00a0is\u00a0nervous\u00a0about this new imminent stage of the war. And, frankly, Ukraine\u2019s allies are, as well.not only Russia but their friends with their fierce defense, holding their own in a conflict that many expected they would lose in a matter of days. But defending territory is different from retaking land that has already been captured, especially when Russia has had months to fortify its positions.A trove of highly classified\u00a0Pentagon materials that was recently leaked included pessimistic assessments of Ukraine\u2019s ability to press an offensive, with\u201cRussia\u2019s grinding campaign of attrition in the Donbas region is likely heading toward a stalemate.\u201dThe tone of the analysis is at odds with the upbeat assessments coming from London and Washington.

In addition to the carnage, it could end up dashing Ukraine\u2019s\u00a0hopes for retaining its territory.Ukraine has been building up for what it hopes is a campaign that transforms the war and gives it the upper hand. If that doesn\u2019t happen, its supporters in the West could lose patience and demand that Kyiv make concessions to Moscow.For now, Ukraine\u2019s allies have been pouring in\u00a0military resources. So far, Ukraine has proven\u00a0their\u00a0initial\u00a0pessimism\u00a0wrong.

Ukrainian soldiers would contend with heavily mined fields, deep anti-tank ditches and trenches. Satellite images confirm Russia has builtin areas where Ukraine is expected to attack, from the east\u00a0and across the south toward Crimea.It all adds up to a rising level of nervousness ahead of a season of intensified combat. It is against this backdrop that the Kremlin accused Kyiv of trying to assassinate Putin.The incident is mysterious. Would the image-conscious Putin deliberately show the mighty Kremlin compound is so vulnerable? Would Ukraine gamble on a decapitation strike?The Kremlin is so uneasy about what lies ahead, that the Victory Day celebrations have beenacross the country. The bleachers are already going up in Red Square, but the celebrations will be very different this year.Citing security concerns, authorities have cancelled some of the most moving traditions for this May 9, including large gatherings and parades honoring those who died in Russia\u2019s wars.

        "text": "Editor\u2019s Note:Holly Thomas is a writer and editor based in London. She is morning editor at Katie Couric Media. She tweetsThe opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author. View moreon CNN.In incredible news for everyone who has found the last year and three months since season 1 came out a bit much, \u201c\u201d is back.In tragic news for my mum, Reg\u00e9-Jean Page \u2013 aka Daphne Briderton\u2019s new husband and reluctant baby daddy, the Duke \u2013 isn\u2019t returning with it. Fans will have to make do with Anthony Bridgerton, Daphne\u2019s hotheaded eldest brother played by Jonathan Bailey, as their new leading man.In this, Anthony takes center stage, as of course does his love life. This focuses quickly on two sisters, Edwina Sharma (Charithra Chandran), who is the season\u2019s belle and therefore the ideal choice, and the older, marriage-averse Kate (Simone Ashley), to whom the Viscount Bridgerton is naturally, immediately attracted. Having spent season 1 either in bed with his now-ex girlfriend or channeling his frustrations at their forced estrangement by dueling his best friend, Anthony has sworn off romance in favor of a resigned, clinical approach to marriage. With the prospects of his younger siblings to consider, he has vowed to find a mate appropriate to care for them and the future Bridgerton line \u2013 a choice that must be weighed independently of love. It\u2019s a fluffy, addictive, entirely watchable disaster waiting to happen.Anthony was the bad boy in season 1, in many ways the shagging, chaotic, antithesis of the stoic, simmering Duke. Every time I watched the show, at least one viewing companion would huff when Anthony came on screen, dismissing \u201cthat prick\u201d before heaving a gratified sigh upon the Duke\u2019s next appearance. It was an understandable response. What indeed would be the point of a show whose entire m.o. is, if we didn\u2019t embrace Page\u2019s concupiscent allure?In the extenuatory spirit of \u201cBridgerton,\u201d however, I think it\u2019s worth giving Anthony a little more credit \u2013 or, at the very least, enough to justify our inevitable transference of affections this spring. It\u2019s a low bar, but Anthony isn\u2019t actually more problematic than the hero of season 1 \u2013 and doesn\u2019t benefit from the years of Regency romance novel programming that, I\u2019d argue, largely explain the audience\u2019s more immediate sympathy for the Duke.While the Duke is a distracting, enticing fantasy, Anthony is essentially making it up as he goes along, masking his passions and fears behind bravado and stomping. Unlike the most famous Regency heroes, the \u201cPride and Prejudice\u201d and \u201cEmma\u201d crowd who tend to be passively courted by mothers and daughters determined to snag advantageous matches, or harbor depths utterly at odds with the face they show the world, Anthony wears his goal plainly, crassly on his sleeve, and has set about fulfilling it himself.The Duke\u2019s habitual silence and harboring of secret demons very much fits the Mr. Darcy-style template every Jane Austen fan is hardwired to eat up. We\u2019re primed to anticipate hisand ultimate union with Daphne, so we view his behavior leading up to that point charitably. He lies about the reason he won\u2019t have kids? Of course he does, his dad was mean to him! Gaslights the woman who loves him when she calls him on that lie? He\u2019ll make it up to her! Characterizes the barest hints about masturbation as a full debrief on sex and reproduction? He did his best! And he looked incredible!Poor old Anthony is messier. While the Duke\u2019s \u201crakish\u201d past is primly referred to in gentlemen\u2019s clubs and during \u201cpromenades\u201d in the park, our first introduction to Anthony sees him making vigorous love to a woman against a tree. We don\u2019t learn until later that she\u2019s his girlfriend Siena, who he secretly supports financially. Anthony\u2019s lust is framed from the get-go as an evasion of responsibility, while the Duke\u2019s is just part of his red-blooded charm.Though both men initially eschew marriage, Anthony\u2019s relationship to the institution is more authentically tortured than the Duke\u2019s in season 1 \u2013 his own mother\u2019s great love with his now-dead father looms over the action like an ideal he fears he can never live up to. As the show proceeds, Anthony\u2019s lack of any recognizable endgame exposes his flaws in a far harsher light than the Duke. But though he also acts clumsily on selfish impulses, Anthony is much more honest about his feelings and motivations.When the Duke appears to have taken up with Daphne, Anthony tells him that though they\u2019re good friends, family has to come first \u2013 and he\u2019s just not keen on his little sis dating someone he knows to be a total, ahem, \u201crake\u201d during her all-important first season. After he challenges the Duke to a duel, he goes right to Siena to give her the heads-up on his potential change of circumstances, and when it turns out he can\u2019t run away with her after all, he offers to support her anyway.Though he\u2019s constantly messing up, Anthony learns from (some) past mistakes \u2013 especially when it comes to letting Daphne choose her own mate and lecturing his younger brothers about their own romantic choices. He then gets a pretty rough deal when his mom orders him to give up Siena, even though she tells Daphne emphatically that she only cares about her marrying for love, but he shoulders it alone. His upfront, emotional approach in the first season having ended in heartbreak, and the fate of his family still weighing heavy on him as its head, it\u2019s no wonder Anthony is resigned to manage his life along more practical lines thereafter.It\u2019s important at this juncture to stress just how rooted in fantasy \u201cBridgerton\u201d is. It suggests that a strikingly bigoted country \u2013 one which failed miserably to accept a non-White royal in the 21st century, let alone the 19th \u2013 has managed to dismantle structural racism in a generation, all because the king made a Black woman his queen. Lady Danbury, played by Adjoa Andoh, refers to the fact her family is accepted by society thanks to this unprecedented union \u2013 which doesn\u2019t really tally with its presumably long-established noble lineage, but sounds encouraging.How much of 'Bridgerton' is forgivable?All this to say, literally nothing is beyond the redemptive power of love in this show. As far as its audience is concerned, Anthony should be no exception, not least because of how familiar he is. As a man \u2013 an early 19th century one at that \u2013 who is not allowed by society to show vulnerability, it\u2019s no wonder that his many insecurities manifest as arrogance.Privileged, immature, impulsive, brain-in-their-pants Anthonys are everywhere. He\u2019s a damn sight more real than a romantic hero like the Duke, whose deceit is \u201creally understandable, when you think about it,\u201d and who improves if you just give him enough space. In real life, men who habitually lie by omission tend not to change. Half-grown guys like Anthony on the other hand, might \u2013 especially once they learn to communicate their emotions in a less explosive way. This would definitely take longer than a summer season in reality, but in magnolia-scented fictional Mayfair, anything is possible.Men whose wealth and status have allowed them to do as they please their entire lives always remain emotionally infantile. Patriarchy hurts men too, albeit so much less than women, and it\u2019s inevitable that men who fall victim will turn other people into scratching posts for their confusion and frustrations. The glossy, candy-cane world of \u201cBridgerton\u201d offers an infinitely safer forum for Anthony to work through his demons than real life might, but he\u2019s still a randy, confused man-child with seven siblings to father. And, as they would in real life, the classism, sexism and puritanical values that hurt everyone are hurting him too."

        "text": "Editor\u2019s Note: Jill Filipovic is a journalist based in New York and author of the book \u201c.\u201d Follow her on. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely her own. Viewon CNN.On Tuesday, President Joe Bidenhe is running for reelection. And he appears to be running largely unopposed in his party. Yes, there are a fewwho have tossed their hats in the ring, but no prominent Democrat has yet to step forward.That\u2019s understandable \u2013 at a moment of, and in the face ofa redo of the 2020 presidential election, Democrats who care more about the nation than about power are wise to line up behind Biden.I count myself among those Democrats. While I would love to see a progressive in the White House, I amof another Donald Trump presidency. And I just don\u2019t see any Democrat in the field whose victory seems assured enough, or who is even enough of a known entity, to roll the dice on.But Biden\u2019s lack of major opposition is also frustrating. He is a lifelong moderate, but thanks in part to promiseson the campaign trail in 2020, he\u2019s been a surprisingly progressive president, particularly when itthat help the working class. By many measures, he issince Franklin D. Roosevelt.But with no progressive Democratic challenger, there\u2019s no one pushing him left in this election cycle. With a Republican likely running to the far right, Biden\u2019s impulse may be to hew to a middle that has been pulled rightward.That\u2019s bad news for Americans. We hear a lot about \u201cpolarization\u201d and \u201cextremism,\u201d but the truth is that it\u2019s largely one party that has grown extreme: the GOP. According to Pew Research Center,than Democrats have moved to the left. And while both parties have fewer elected moderates than they did a few decades ago, the Republican Party has become far more conservative.Opinion: Biden picks a lucky day to launch his campaign. Is it OK that he\u2019s superstitious?At the same time, conservatism has been taken to further extremes. According to an analysis in the Journal of Democracy. Data compiled by the Center for Strategic and International Studies, and thenin 2021, showed that from 2015 \u2013\u00a0the year Trump announced his candidacy \u2013 to 2021, \u201cright-wing extremists have been involved in 267 plots or attacks and 91 fatalities.\u201d By contrast, left-wing extremists were involved in 66 incidents, which were associated with 19 deaths.For as much as conservatives and some moderates hand-wring about the extreme left, there are virtually no left-wing extremists in elected office. While some on the right claim the progressive congresswomen of \u201cthe Squad\u201d are extremists, their views are well within the normal right-left spectrum seen in most economically stable democracies, including this one.These congresswomen do not cheer on political violence, encourage the overthrow of the government, push for an authoritarian system over a democratic one or argue that American economic and political systems should be crushed and replaced with communism. At their most radical, they argue for European-style social democracy, with more aid to the American people and more taxes and checks on corporations and the wealthy.By contrast, the Republican Party is teeming with people who have views far more extreme than even those of many conservative voters, whether the issue isororor. The GOP tolerates members who stand accused of,and spout conspiracy theories that range from the simply bizarre to the.And a troubling number of Republicans have utterly failed to uphold American democracy when it faced its most significant challenge in years: A Trumpian conspiracy theory that the 2020 election was stolen, followed by a violent attack on the Capitol in an attempt to overturn the results of a free and fair election. In this crucial moment, 147 Republicans in Congress.Opinion: If Biden\u2019s so unpopular, why isn\u2019t any Democrat posing a serious challenge?Whatever you think of the policy positions held by progressive Democratic congresswomen, there is simply no comparison here, which is what makes the 2024 election so important.If Biden spends the next year and a half running against a Republican \u2013 instead of competing in a Democratic primary \u2013 the incentive will be for him to move right in an effort to capture Republican and Republican-leaning independent voters. But it would be better for the country if Biden staked out a solid position on the center-left, which would better represent the interests of both the Democratic base and the moderates who want to see democracy restored.There is also the age question. Biden is elderly, and while plenty of people can work into their 80s, Biden is already the nation\u2019s oldest president ever at 80. There are real concerns about how effective any person can be \u2013 physically and cognitively \u2013 when they are working one of the world\u2019s most demanding jobs.And finally, there\u2019s the problem \u2013 a big one \u2013 that Biden just isn\u2019t all that popular. According to a new, 70% of Americans say that Biden shouldn\u2019t run again, with about half saying that his age is a major factor. Fewer \u2013 60% \u2013 say the same about Trump.That said, while Biden lacks the fervent base that Trump enjoys, he also lacks the red-hot hatred that so many liberals and moderates feel toward Trump. Biden isn\u2019t all that inspiring, but he\u2019s also not all that polarizing.And perhaps most importantly: Who else is there?Right now, the two leading Republican candidates are Trump and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, the latter of whom has not even officially declared he is running. Either of them would make for a catastrophic presidency, and both pose an existential threat to American democracy. Trump has already demonstrated just how dangerous he can be; he\u2019s already gearing up forround two.Opinion: The campaign promise that could elect the next American presidentAnd DeSantis has used his power in Florida to go on a spree of anti-intellectualism,, curtailingand, while also doubling down on authoritarian overreach, including strippingandof their fundamental rights to their own bodies.For Democrats, there\u2019s no other obvious superstar, and no one who I\u2019d bet on in a contest for the future of the country. Vice President Kamala Harristhe Democratic base, and her time as the number two has yielded few noteworthy accomplishments. The US Senate is a stale, and the few inspiring potential candidates in that chamber (Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts) are elderly or, in the case of Warren, haveto make headway with primary voters in the past.Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer is an exciting figure, but, remains relatively marginal on the national scene.\u00a0 Wes Moore, the newly-elected governor of Maryland, is similarly inspiring, but a presidential run too soon could turn him into a quick has-been rather than a rising star. \u00a0And, in any case, Whitmer and Moore aren\u2019t going to risk their reputations and the party\u2019s goodwill to run against Biden.Now that doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t see room to critique Biden\u2019s first term. His response to the Supreme Court\u2019s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade has left much to be desired, and while his administration hasn\u2019t been totally absent, it alsoto secure abortion rights for as many people as possible. Hisshamefully left behind far too many people who risked their lives to aid the United States or to advocate for democracy and human rights in their own country. And hishave been human rights disasters.He, like every president before him, has utterly failed to provide American parents with much-needed paid leave or universal childcare, even if hetry. And when he believes that bigger goals like combating climate change and reducing US dependence on fossil fuels are in conflict with American jobs (a conflict that progressives say is a false choice), he tends to choose American jobs \u2013 approving, for example,.And yet, despite all of that, Biden has beenthan I anticipated he would be. While Covid-19 is not over, Biden has transitioned the country out of the stage of acute emergency, helping Americans have a financial cushion and rolling out vaccines. He has taken action on climate change, on prescription drug prices, on infrastructure and on student loans. He\u2019s appointed severalto the federal bench.Simply put, Biden gets stuff done \u2013 and it\u2019s stuff that overwhelmingly helps average Americans and the working class, not wealthy donors.In a perfect world, Biden would face a progressive primary contender\u00a0\u2013 someone who actually stood a chance of winning. That would give the Americans who vote in Democratic primaries a chance to send a clear signal: Do they want more of Biden, or do they want to see the nation move more to the left? And in that same perfect world, the best candidate would go on to soundly defeat Trump, or whoever the Republican candidate may be.But we live in the real world, where a hyper-competent and highly-qualified woman who was not a far lefty and was only marginally more progressive than Biden was already beaten by a right-wing candidate who bullied and barked. Given the stakes, and the nation\u2019s historical preference for incumbents, it makes sense for progressive Democrats to sit this one out and for the rest of us to bet on Biden \u2013 even if he is far from our ideal horse to put in the race."

Nothing changes this weekend, which comes eight months after Prince Charles became the king immediately following the death of his mother, Queen Elizabeth II. The ritualistic crowning, which is, is an archaic event thathave done away with.It\u2019s ironic that the country claiming to be thehas clung so fervently to the tradition.

The British monarchy, on the other hand, has a plethora of () royal jewels,, a 100-plus-carat symbol of imperial plunder from India.Publichave been shifting with modernity, and the coronation doesn\u2019t seem to be helping to keep them positive. According to the British government, the event represents a \u201c,\u201d which made sense when Brits believed in the. But given that the, and presumably even fewer believe that Charles derives his authority from God, such a bells-and-whistles church production seems entirely unnecessary.More generally, adays before the coronation found that a massive 70% of Brits aged 18 to 35 said they are \u201cnot interested\u201d in the royal family (overall, 58% weren\u2019t). It also found that a plurality of 45% believe Charles is \u201cout of touch\u201d with the experiences of the public.Opinion: The hidden meaning in the anointing of King Charlesto make public the true cost of the coronation, and a spokesperson said in a statement, \u201cOne of the lessons from Her late Majesty\u2019s funeral was how a national occasion like this, a great State occasion, does attract huge global interest that more than repays the expenditure that goes with it, indeed it vastly exceed it in terms of the boost to our economy and to our nation\u2019s standing.\u201dIt is often argued that the. However, these tourist dollars might well continue whether or not the royal family does. The most-, both in a country, France, that. It is entirely plausible that Buckingham Palace would welcome more paying visitors if the royals no longer lived there.Either way, to force British taxpayers like me to pay for Charles\u2019 vanity party is disrespectful to the will of the people, especially when the new sovereign\u2019s enormous wealth could sponsor the event multiple times over.Following his mother\u2019s death, Charles($19.1 billion). On that massive sum, he didn\u2019t have to pay the 40% inheritance tax a member of the general public would have had to. Add to that the king\u2019s regular income, starting with the sovereign grant \u2013 an annual payment from the British governmentAnotherflows from the Duchy of Lancaster estate, which produced \u00a324 million ($30 million) in income for Charles in the most recent financial year.\u00a0He is also the beneficiary of a $500 million\u2013 that the public is bankrolling.The sovereign grant was introduced in 1760 by\u2013 the same ruler whose policy ofhelped ignite the US war of independence. The grant\u2019 budgets by a staggering amount. (The Spanish monarchy, for example, has an annual budget of around $9 million.) Maybe if a tighter budget is applied to the British royal family, Charles rather than taxpayers will be paying the next time he opts to board ato attend a James Bond premiere.While the UK is unlikely to join France as a republic anytime soon, the least Charles and the rest of the royal family could do \u2013 if they care about the fate of their country as much as they claim \u2013 is shoulder the cost of ceremonial events that come as the.I, for one, couldn\u2019t care less about glamorous royal PR stunts. In fact I\u2019ve gone abroad to escape what feels like forced patriotism in London, and I\u2019m not alone. Travel agents across Britain have reported aas Brits take advantage of the Monday they are being given off as part of the festivities. Bloomberg reported that the extra public holiday could help trigger a 0.7%. We should make sure to add that to His Majesty\u2019s tab."

        "text": "Editor\u2019s Note:Lately, I\u2019ve been nostalgic for the Quiet Car.In a world filled with hustle and noise, Amtrak\u2019s dedicated space for non-talkers, readers and introverts was a deeply satisfying breath of fresh air, and I always felt a certain kinship with my fellow quiet-seeking passengers. Almost always, though, there\u2019d be somebody who didn\u2019t get the message, and \u2014 despite the signs and the announcements \u2014 yammered blithely on their phone while the rest of us exchanged neighborly side-eyes.Often, I was willing to be the person who sidled over to remind them, as politely as possible, that this was a communal minimal-noise space. After I left New York City, I lived vicariously through like-minded bossy friends (you know who you are, fellow journos) who recounted Quiet Car adventures on social media.Though fairly low-stakes in the grand scheme of things, the Quiet Car was a valuable metaphor for the way humans can create beauty in community. I find conflict anxiety-inducing, but I was also interested in standing up for our collective rights. And isn\u2019t this how a functioning civilization works? We learn to exist, together, and to be willing to engage in debate about what defines our shared space, about how to respect the rules and how to honor our shared humanity.And hey, if you\u2019re a loud talker? No worries, the majority of the train is reserved just for you! There\u2019s room for everyone here. Or there used to be.You wouldn\u2019t find me sticking my neck out on the Quiet Car today.\u00a0This spring has seen aagainst citizens who\u2019ve made minor overtures of one sort or another to neighbors or complete strangers.

And I\u2019m not trying to minimize the body count by invoking the Quiet Car. On the contrary, I think we can use the metrics of how people treat one another in such mundane situations as a bellwether for the state and sanity of the nation.I\u2019m a longtime student of the school of good manners. (Manners being different from the elitist practice of, as discussed on aof the podcast \u201cWe Can Do Hard Things.\u201d) In evolutionary biologist Amy Alkon\u2019s\u201cGood Manners for Nice People Who Sometimes Say F*ck,\u201d she explains one foundational principle I like a lot.She says that society \u201ccan\u2019t turn back the clock to a world where we all live in a small village and everybody knows everybody and the blacksmith. What we can do is take steps to re-create some of the constraints and benefits of the small groupings we evolved to live in\u2026 We could dial back a lot of the ME FIRST!/SCREW YOU! meanness permeating our society if we do just three things: Stand up to the rude. Expose the rude. Treat strangers like neighbors.\u201dAlkon acknowledges that it\u2019s inherently uncomfortable for most people, but counters that learning to call out rudeness is an exercise in \u201cchoosing to live connected instead of alienated. Choosing to be a neighbor instead of a bystander.\u201dI\u2019d add a corollary to her 2014 writing, which is that calling out rudenessis the goal; social-media shaming, while effective, can spiral out of control way more quickly than the shamer intended. And in a moment when the US surgeon generalabout how isolated and disconnected Americans are, thinking about the choices to be connected to each other \u2014 or not \u2014 take on national significance.For most of my adult life, I subscribed to this philosophy. I always believed our society, although a complete mess in many ways, was capable of weathering prickly negotiations between people about how we should collectively conduct ourselves.Sara StewartOne memory that rings particularly chilling to me right now is the time my husband and I asked our then-next-door neighbors to stop shooting at songbirds in the backyard. What happened next? Well, they stopped. That evening, one of them even surprised us by coming by to apologize.But when the response to asking someone not to shoot an AR-15 at 11 at night, near other people\u2019s houses, while a baby is sleeping,\u00a0might be?\u00a0I\u2019m not sure how we move forward from that. And the torrent of events isn\u2019t slowing: literally, as I am writing these words, I\u2019ve learned of more: Ain Colorado following an altercation between two Tesla owners at an electric-vehicle charging station. It was just a week ago when one neighbor allegedlyfor complaining about the noise of a leaf blower.Then there were the people who weren\u2019t even braving what they thought might be an argument:, shot in Missouri for knocking on the wrong door., shot after mistaking a stranger\u2019s car for their own., fatally shot when the car she was riding in made a wrong turn into an upstate New York driveway. Six-year-old, shot along with her parents in North Carolina after her basketball rolled into a neighbor\u2019s yard., teenagers shot at in Florida after trying to deliver Instacart groceries to the wrong address.Opinion: I can\u2019t look away from the house where Ralph Yarl was shotOne of the effects of this heartbreaking series of events will be to further quash any citizen instinct to reach out when in need of basic assistance, to put forth a hand in attempted connection with another person, or to speak up for others. If you think this is an exaggeration, consider another recent headline:of pastor\u00a0Anthony Watts,\u00a0a Good Samaritan in Mississippi.None of this is an accident. A number of well-documented, decades-long campaigns have created a populace that\u2019s stewing in anger and comfortable dehumanizing other people.

        "text": "Editor\u2019s Note: Jacob J. Lew served as\u00a0US\u00a0Treasury secretary from 2013 to 2017 and director of the Office of Management and Budget from 2010 to 2012 and from 1998 to 2001. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own.\u00a0Viewon CNN.Earlier this week, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellenthat based on the receipts from recent tax filings, the United States may be unable to pay all of its bills as early as June 1 \u2014 less than one month from now. Congress must act now to extend the debt ceiling to clear the path for fiscal negotiations and to avoid default, a self-inflicted wound that would hurt our economy, burden hard-working Americans and damage our influence internationally.The risk of defaulting\u00a0on America\u2019s debt\u00a0is even greater today than it was in 2011, when I was director of the White House Office of Management and Budget, and in 2013, when I was secretary of the Treasury. Washington is even more polarized, and House Republicans\u2019 demands are\u00a0more extreme. The House passed a bill\u00a0last month\u00a0that they know is unacceptable to both theand the,\u00a0yetthat they will not support a less extreme final bill.Even approaching default has very real consequences. In 2011, we reached an agreement at ther, but the brinksmanship led to a. And today, as the country approaches default,\u00a0interest rates are already going up and demand down forthat would mature in the period when the debt ceiling could hit.Higher interest rates mean higher costs, both for taxpayers who foot the bill for billions of dollars in higher interest costs, and private borrowers who face higher rates for their mortgages and personal loans. And for the Treasury market, the deepest and most liquid in the world, less demand means both higher cost and a risk that there will not be buyers for debt\u00a0that matures in the window.In 2011, the US saw more than $1 billion in higherand real anxiety around the world \u2014 and that was a case in which the US did not actually default. The cost and loss of confidence would only be greater if a default were to actually happen.Opinion: The real out-of-control college costs aren\u2019t where you thinkDefault is not an option. Failing to make interest and principal payments to bondholders would be a credit default. And it would also be default if the US government fails to pay its other bills \u2014 benefits to American families, funding owed to states and localities for things like school or health care, and payments to businesses for work already done and goods already delivered.Congress authorized spending that is already underway\u00a0and set the tax policy that falls short in terms of revenue collected. Failure to raise the debt ceiling would mean defaulting on one obligation or another, because there simply will not be enough money in the Treasury to pay all the bills.This is not an economic crisis; it is a manufactured political crisis. It is not a question of whether the government of the United States is fiscally sound; with the debt ceiling raised, the US remains the safest investment in the world. The definition of risk-free investing is to buy a US Treasury bill or note.It is a question of whether our political system still works.The House bill is not a solution, or even a serious negotiating position. It would repeal most of President Joe\u00a0Biden\u2019s signature, the most significant US effort to address this existential threat. The House bill says it freezes appropriated spending, but after exempting defense and veterans programs, it would reduce funding for everything else \u2014 education, health research, child care and other critical services \u2014, with cuts growingover time.The bill also would jeopardize the health and well-being of low-income Americans byand income assistance (for the very poorest children) when adults are not able to prove that they meet a rigid work requirement or qualify for an exemption, creating a wall of red tape that hasin states that tried a similar approach. And the list goes on.Negotiations over whether to raise the debt ceiling and protect America\u2019s good credit should never be on the table, but negotiations\u00a0over fiscal policy are surely appropriate. With\u00a0Republicans\u00a0takingoff the table and\u00a0Democrats and Republicans\u00a0agreeing that areas like Social Security, Medicare andare\u00a0off limits this year, that leaves a relatively small share of the budget as the fiscal decision for this year.\u00a0And that decision needs to be made so Congress can write spending bills for the fiscal year that begins on October 1.Neither side will be entirely happy with the outcome, but that is how decisions on budgets are made when parties with very different views need to work through the differences.\u00a0And the sooner the better.\u00a0That\u2019s whyto the White House to discuss the budget next week.But those negotiations take time and cannot take place under threat of default. Time is running out, and Congress should immediately extend the debt ceiling until after the next\u00a0presidential\u00a0election so budget negotiations are not clouded by the looming threat of default. If that is not possible, the debt ceiling should be suspended until the\u00a0White House and Congress can reach a regular budget agreement.If they\u00a0fail to reach an agreement by October 1, that would raise the risk of a government shutdown. Bad as that would be, it is far less dangerous than default."

        "text": "Editor\u2019s Note:For much of its history, the USkept its banks local and sector-specific. The Founders had known first-hand the evils of concentrated metropolitan banking \u2014 ignorance of local\u00a0borrowers and economic\u00a0conditions, focus on short-term profits\u00a0rather than long-term investments, and related problems.\u00a0They understood the importance of fostering a continent-wide economy as diversified acrossas it was across. And so they kept our banks focused on, not.This began changing during the 1980s and 1990s, when Congress repealed all previous, as well as the oldon mixing productive lending in the real economy with financial speculation on Wall Street. We were left with a banking system ever more nationally concentrated.To end, and perhaps even partly reverse, this ongoing process of concentration, which recent bank failures since March have accelerated, Congress must pass legislation that lifts deposit insurance caps.Regional, community and sector-specific industrial banks like Silicon Valley Bank\u00a0lent\u00a0\u201cpatient capital\u201d to startups and small businesses \u2014 the incubators of future industrial renewal. In other words, the banks were willing to wait years before expecting their startup borrowers to turn profits \u2014 essential in industries that require time to scale up before they can become profitable.They stood ready to fuel the new growth where it was needed, knowing as they did both the special needs of their clients in particular sectors \u2014 like tech, for example \u2014 and economic conditions in the locales where their clients did business.Capped deposit insurance is now destroying these banks.Federal deposit insurance coverage is currently\u00a0limited to\u00a0$250,000. That would be plenty for you and me, but the startups and other small businesses on which our industrial recovery depends have large payrolls and weekly operating expenses. For them, $250,000 is mere chump change.They are thus faced with a Hobson\u2019s choice, especially in times of banking distress like the present: Retain the advantages of regionally focused, client-sensitive, sector-specific Main Street banking at risk of losing deposits in bank runs, or flee to the safety of too-big-to-fail, one-size-fits-all global Wall Street banks that know nothing of their regions\u2019 or businesses\u2019 special conditions or needs.\u00a0That flight is now well underway, with JPMorgan Chasein deposits since late March alone, leaving it with\u2014 far in excess of the 10% bank antitrust limit.There isto force this choice on our producers. Federal deposit insurance isand volume-indexed \u2014 that is,. This means there\u2019s literally no purpose for arbitrary, which are a holdover from the days when deposit insurance wasn\u2019taccording to bank lending behavior and deposit volume.Congress must accordingly pass legislation to lift the caps. The only alternative, as we watch small bank deposits continue their exodus to\u00a0JPMorgan Chase CEO\u00a0Jamie Dimon\u2019s welcoming Wall Street arms, is an economy with one or two megabanks more excited by short-term speculative profits on global capital markets than by steadily rebuilding America one sector and region at a time."

Viewon CNN.President Franklin Roosevelt launched a war against the Great Depression. President Lyndon Johnson launched a war against poverty. President Ronald Reagan launched a war against communism. Gov. Ron DeSantis \u2013 a potential 2024 candidate \u2013 has decided to launch his war against Disney, one of America\u2019s most iconic companies and a crucial source of revenue for his home state of Florida.The conflict between the up-and-coming Republican and the company behind Mickey Mouse started when Disney, responding to, criticized the \u201c\u201d bill limiting discussions about sexual and gender identity in the classroom.DeSantis, who signed the bill into law, decided to take punitive action, stripping the company of its privileged tax status and creating a new board to oversee Disney\u2019s special taxing district. Not to be outfoxed, Disney struck a multi-decade deal with the outgoing board members days before the new, DeSantis-appointed one took over.After the new board rendered the agreement null and void, Disney struck back with force andagainst the governor and his oversight board, claiming that he weaponized his political power to punish the company for exercising its free speech rights. With each side digging its heels in, the conflict is turning into a.For DeSantis, this has been a terrible political move. As former President Donald Trump ramps ups his campaign, DeSantis is.\u00a0With his war on Disney, the governor has taken yet another step away from being the \u201cmost electable\u201d Republican of the pack.Disney has a \u2018strong case\u2019 against DeSantis over his \u2018retaliatory campaign,\u2019 First Amendment experts sayWhy is the decision so damaging?For one, DeSantis is boxing himself in as a right-wing cultural warrior. Initially, one of his biggest political assets was his ability to build the kind of coalition others in his party found so difficult, having made significant inroads amongin Florida.DeSantis also touted his executive record of promoting economic growth and his handling of the pandemic. During the 2022 campaign, DeSantis released an ad\u00a0\u2013 reminiscent of Reagan\u2019s famousof 1984 \u2013stressing how people went to work and kids went to school when many other states shut down during the.By picking a fight with Disney, however, DeSantis ends up distracting voters from his governing abilities and ends up looking like a slightly more polished version of Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene.\u00a0While many Republicans love the culture wars, it is far from clear that it is a winning strategy in a national election.It\u2019s also not a great look for a potential Republican presidential candidate to go after corporate America. Despite all the talk about, the reality is that big business remains a central constituency of the GOP. The party\u2019s supply side and deregulatory economic policies have always been at the heart of the political coalition the GOP built since Reagan\u2019s presidency.Trump\u2019s GOP rivals struggle to break through as former president cements frontrunner statusDeSantis seems to be playing into the GOP\u2019s rhetoric about populism while overlooking the reality that wealthier Americans and business executives make up a key component of the base. Watching a governor go after a major company in his own state \u2014 at the same time that House Republicans are creating unnecessary economic instability bythe debt ceiling\u00a0\u2014 will certainly rattle corporations that want stability, predictability, hands-off government and profit. They certainly don\u2019t want to be thinking about a possible president who seems willing to take punitive action against a company for saying something that could suddenly be branded as \u201cwoke.\u201dIt\u2019s also odd that DeSantis has chosen to go after a company that is one of the most iconic cultural products of modern American history. Disney is in many ways a symbol of the very wholesome family values that Republicans try to align themselves with.And if the point is to demonstrate that he is a fighter, the governor will never be able to match Trump on this front. Trying to take the former president on in this manner is a fool\u2019s errand. As so many other Republicans before him have learned, this is one arena where Trump is almost impossible to defeat and very few voters will be convinced that DeSantis can ever match him in the realm of political combat.Highlighting many of the pitfalls of DeSantis\u2019 feud with Disney, Republican presidential candidate: \u201cHey @Disney, my home state will happily accept your 70,000+ jobs if you want to leave Florida. We\u2019ve got great weather, great people, and it\u2019s always a great day in South Carolina! SC\u2019s not woke, but we\u2019re not sanctimonious about it either.\u201dDeSantis\u2019s decision on Disney has been a self-inflicted wound that will do irreparable damage to a potential campaign. He is very quickly joining the long list of politically promising governors, such as Texas\u2019s Rick Perry and Florida\u2019s Jeb Bush, who flame out under the glare of the national spotlight."

Viewon CNN.Former President Donald Trump\u00a0is considering sitting out one or both of the first two Republican primary debates,.\u00a0During a campaign event in New Hampshire this week, Trump pointed to his recent poll numbers andwhy he would participate in the debates given his lead over the other GOP candidates.Meanwhile, the Democratic National Committee\u00a0(DNC)\u00a0doesn\u2019t\u00a0have any primary debates scheduled \u2013 a move that helps President Joe Biden and hurts his challengers Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Marianne Williamson. It\u2019s clear the DNC doesn\u2019t see Kennedy or Williamson as serious contenders, and Biden seems to prefer a Rose Garden strategy, where the focus of his campaign revolves around being the president and showing the country how he does the job.Having fewer debates, however, is not necessarily a bad thing. But quantity is not the issue here. Quality is.Of course, the number of debates\u00a0for each party\u00a0is subject to change. Trump, for instance, could simply be bluffing to add some intrigue.\u00a0And a more serious Biden challenger could enter the race, prompting the DNC to schedule a debate.But, at this rate, it\u2019s possible that\u00a0the debates\u00a0will play a much smaller role in 2024 than they did in 2016 or in 2020.\u00a0And if the two parties end up nominating Biden and Trump, many Americans may\u00a0also choose to\u00a0tune out any debates, thinking they are already\u00a0quite\u00a0familiar with both candidates.That would be a departure from the norm, since debates have been a big part of presidential politics since World War II. Richard Nixon famously squared off against John F. Kennedy in 1960, with an estimated 70 million Americans tuning in to the first of a series of live televised debates between the two major presidential candidates. Nixon seemed nervous and sickly next to the young senator, whose charisma and good looks became the.Opinion: The border surge is Biden\u2019s problem to solveIn 1976, tens of millions of Americans watched as a technical glitchand forced President Gerald Ford and former\u00a0Georgia\u00a0Gov. Jimmy Carter to stand in awkward silence for 27 minutes while the cameras continued to roll.In 1980, Ronald Reagan, who decided to pay for a Republican primary debate in New Hampshire with his own campaign funds after the Federal Election Commission ruled against a newspaper-sponsored debate, famously snapped at a moderator,: \u201cI am paying for this microphone.\u201dDebates also played a huge role in the 2016 campaign. Democratic candidates Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders participated in, duking it out over the principles that should define the party.Meanwhile, the Republican primary debates in 2016 often felt like professional wrestling matches as Trump hammered away. Through name-calling, insults and lacerating quips, Trump took down each of his opponents, one by one. Not only were these primetime events, but clips of these attacks were posted and reshared over and over again on social media.The 2020 debates were not quite as thrilling, even though they continued to play a key role in the election. Biden had to survive a number of tough moments in the Democratic primary debates, like when then-Sen. Kamala Harris criticized him for hisas a means of desegregation\u00a0in the 1970s.\u00a0(he supported school integration, but opposed busing because he thought it had a negative impact.)On the Republican side, Trump. When it came time to face off against Biden, voters got a taste of each candidate\u2019s demeanor. Biden, who was sharper than many expected, showed that he could land a good punch, while Trump continued to display his in your face, say anything, chaotic approach.Things might play out differently in 2024. Trump has very little incentive to debate, especially since he can command plenty of attention with his campaign events and social media outbursts. And if he continues to poll well above his opponents, he won\u2019t feel the need\u00a0to\u00a0grant them opportunities to gain more exposure. Biden, meanwhile, would rather focus on showing he can govern, as opposed to engaging in verbal combat, which has never been his forte.This isn\u2019t to say debates have no value.\u00a0Debates,\u00a0if and when they happen,\u00a0should serve the purpose of informing voters about the candidates. The organizers and hosts of these events should figure out a way to take this responsibility seriously \u2013 that means pushing back on the theatrics and showmanship in real time, asking candidates to answer policy questions and pressing them to demonstrate their ability to govern. Too much is at stake, from an unstable economy to continued war in Europe, to get this wrong in 2024."

        "text": "A few weeks ago, I bought a young Black homeless man a chicken sandwich and a drink. I was on Eighth Avenue, just a few blocks down from Madison Square Garden, when I saw him holding the door open to the fast-food restaurant. He made it clear, not with words but with a quiet nod, he was hoping one of the entering customers would buy him something to eat, so I did.I don\u2019t know what that sandwich did for that man. For me, I felt as though my efforts amounted to a drop in the bucket. I wanted tohim, treat him as the full-complex human being he is \u2014 a man made in God\u2019s image just as I have been made in God\u2019s image \u2014 but instead walked away not sure whether I had belittled us both. I felt ethically impotent \u2014 knowing that I alone couldn\u2019t lift him into a better life \u2014 and morally bankrupt, knowing that I had the resources to offer more than just a chicken sandwich and a drink.Truth be told, I don\u2019t know why I bought him the sandwich. A sense of duty? He caught me in a giving mood? Truth be told more fully, when I initially saw him, I considered finding another restaurant, not wanting to be disturbed by his existence. It was one of many encounters I had with the homeless I remembered when I heard what happened to, a 30-year-old homeless Black man who was a well-known Michael Jackson impersonator in New York City.On May 1, Neely boarded the F train and shouted\u00a0that he was hungry, thirsty and tired of having nothing before a\u00a0Marine veteran\u00a0placed him in a chokehold (later saying,, that he felt Neely posed a threat to passengers).at a hospital. (The Manhattan district attorney\u2019s office is investigating, and no charges have been brought.) Though New York City\u2019s medical examiner said the direct cause of death, I can\u2019t shake the feeling that I was among the indirect causes.Jordan Neely, the man killed in chokehold on NYC subway, is remembered as an entertainer shattered by his mother\u2019s murderWhen I got to New York in late December, I largely went along with the status quo, an acceptance of the routine dehumanization of fellow human beings, fellow human beings like Neely and an estimated. I wasn\u2019t protesting in the subway station where Neely was killed, like, to raise awareness and a sense of urgency. Instead, I quickly perfected the art of rendering the homeless all but invisible, much more concerned about my own convenience \u2014 will the train get me to my destination on time? \u2014 than their plight.I\u2019m not new to homelessness. I grew up in the small town of St. Stephen, South Carolina, where my mom essentially turned our house into a de facto, one-stop shop for homeless and mentally ill men and women, and others down on their luck. She did that, even though we needed food stamps and free government cheese to survive. I grew up helping her help them.As a professional journalist, I had a breakthrough story about the growing homeless population in Myrtle Beach, one of the top resort areas in the country. A photojournalist and I spent several nights over a few weeks inside a homeless shelter, and on the streets with the unhoused, getting to know them, their habits, their wants and their dreams.Maybe that\u2019s why I wasn\u2019t expecting the issue of homelessness to gnaw away at me like it did in New York. But I wasn\u2019t so much bothered by the presence of homeless people as I was bothered by my own feelings of helplessness.It was impossible not to see them, not to be reminded that we\u2019ve accepted an enormous amount of inequality in the wealthiest country in the world, even in the heart of the banking capital of the world. (Poverty is the fourth-leading cause of death of Americans behind only heart disease, cancer and smoking, according to.)I bought a young Black man a chicken sandwich and drink \u2014 but only after walking past a couple dozen other homeless people that day whom I didn\u2019t even bother to look in the eye, like I did every day. I gave others money \u2014 dollar bills, $10s, $20s \u2014 convinced none of it made much of a difference.Opinion: Outrage and fear about homelessness never seem to lead to the obvious choiceOne Sunday afternoon, I saw a man splayed out on the sidewalk where I had seen people let their dogs pee and defecate, his left arm bent at a 45-degree angle, his left hand operating as a pillow. His skin was as dark and leathery as my father\u2019s.I just walked past him, like everyone else. Ihe was alive, just sleeping. I didn\u2019t consider how he could be somebody\u2019s father or grandfather, somebody\u2019s uncle or cousin, somebody\u2019s lost love. I tried not to think about what condition had led him to that sidewalk, whether it was mental illness, bad money management, alcoholism, bad timing in the stock market, gentrification, New York\u2019s rapidly rising home prices and rent, the legacy ofor just bad luck. It was easier not to think about men and women like him.I was living a contradiction and knew it. I think most New Yorkers know they are, too. Intellectually, I thought it was good, necessary even, to make all of humanity\u2019s complexity visible. I appreciated that about New York. It\u2019s why I disagree with US Rep., who proclaimed that \u201cthere\u2019s so much crime in the city\u201d and that it \u201csmells badTo me, a man from South Carolina, New York City doesn\u2019t smell bad. New York smells like honesty. Homeless men and women mingling on the sidewalk with the rich and middle class is a kind of honesty often avoided where I\u2019m from. It\u2019s the kind of honesty that smokes out hypocrisy.But it was hard not to feel like I was a hypocrite in New York, where it was routine to accept a large number of hurting people, including the Black woman I saw walking around in black socks on a 35-degree day and few of us even looked her way, let alone thought to help. New York may smell like honesty and present itself as such, but it has hypocritical bouts of apathy, too.Being in New York exposed my own hypocrisy. It\u2019s true that not once did I consider putting a homeless man in a chokehold, especially not for several minutes, no matter how uncomfortable they sometimes made me.Neither do I want homeless people to be hidden from public view or rounded up by police, taken to jail or forced to languish in institutions. But my default response to them in real time revealed that in uncomfortable moments I would rather not have to confront the ungodly high level of decades-deep inequality we\u2019ve allowed to take root into our society \u2014 with no end in sight \u2014 when all I want to do is get to my apartment after a long day of work.In South Carolina, it\u2019s not hard to avoid the presence of homeless. Though they make an occasional appearance at the stoplight near a Walmart or on the Myrtle Beach boardwalk, they are largely concentrated in areas I can avoid by refusing to stop while cruising in my Chevrolet Colorado.In New York, at least in Manhattan where I spent much of my time, I encountered homeless people on most street corners and train stations. And yet I had in short order become conditioned to believe it was best to ignore them nonetheless.It\u2019s why when I think of Neely, I\u2019m convinced he wasn\u2019t dehumanized simply because he wore dark skin, though race may have played a role, or because he might have been in the midst of an outburst caused by a mental illness that made others uncomfortable. Before he stepped on the F train, most of us had treated him like the walking dead, an empty body life had escaped long before that day.I\u2019m angry that Neely was killedwho did not appearto prevent his death.\u00a0I\u2019m just not certain my actions over the past several months were much better than theirs.All I did was buy a homeless Black man a sandwich and a drink and gave others a few dollars to feel better about my daily acceptance of their routine dehumanization. I didn\u2019t kill Neely. But I didn\u2019t do much to save him, either."

        "text": "Can the first coronation in 70 years inspire patriotism in a nation facing a vastly reduced role on the global stage and a growing awareness of the ongoing harmful legacy of imperialism in the United Kingdom and beyond?For King Charles III,Saturday at London\u2019s Westminster Abbey\u00a0was\u00a0the culmination of a lifetime spent preparing to ascend to the throne. The British monarch is, in theory at least, a neutral figurehead with no political affiliations, no manifesto and no discernible allegiance to any side in the so-called culture wars.As such, Charles\u00a0must have hoped\u00a0that these three days of coronation celebrations\u00a0would enable\u00a0the 150 million inhabitants of the UK and 14 otherover which he reigns to revel in a shared sense of identity and destiny.\u00a0But have they?\u00a0In the four nations of theand,to Saturday\u2019s spectacular ceremony appear to have ranged widely from bemused indifference to proud delight to downright outrage.For many British people, exasperated by recent royal controversies and scandals such as those involving Princesandand distracted by a, the most important moment in Charles\u2019 life\u00a0will have hadlittle or no impact on theirs. Although plenty of citizens won\u2019t let growing levels ofabout the monarchy and its rituals prevent them enjoying some good-naturedthrough Monday, some may well ask themselves what it actually means to be British in 2023.Opinion: King Charles is making his subjects pay for his vanity party. How old-fashionedI know many of my close British friends and colleagues are pondering that very question. This is especially true of those whose skin is Black or brown and of their allies in the struggle for racial equality. The coronation ceremony, updated to include the leaders of a range of faiths and attended by guests of various ethnicities, was carefully orchestrated to reflect what Buckingham Palace has called \u201c.\u201dHowever, it is difficult to buy into this parading of cherished diversity fully when report after report has revealed the shocking levels ofthat blight every aspect of life for underserved minority communities in the UK, fromtoand.At the same time, new historical research (much of which has been carried out by The Guardian newspaper) is highlighting a spider\u2019s web of direct links between the transatlantic slave trade and many of the pillars of British society.,,, entireand many wealthy\u2014 including the\u2014 are being shown to have taken part in commissioning, organizing, funding and/or profiting from centuries of human trafficking. The terrible legacy of this manufacture of trauma on a grand scale is still with us.Many of the closely intertwined global problems we face today \u2014 the gulf between the poorest and richest nations, the disproportionate impact of(and brownest) inhabitants of our planet, widespread racial and social injustice \u2014 can be traced back to the European empires of which Britain\u2019s was the largest.Meanwhile, the royal family\u2019s vast wealth is being unfavorably exposed toin a process that is shining a spotlight on many priceless treasures, some of which were shamelessly pillaged from British colonies around the world.Opinion: Why Britain is so weirded out by pledging allegiance to CharlesIn the UK, patriotic spirit has long drawn heavily on a fuzzy, idealized sense of the \u201cglories\u201d of this small island nation\u2019s past, rooted in the imperial era when Britannia ruled the waves in the name of the monarch of the day.The late Queen Elizabeth II\u2019s coronation in 1953 took place against a backdrop of anxiety about what the loss of empire would mean for postwar Britain. Over the course of her reign,of the former Commonwealth realms became republics.Caribbean countries are now thought to be likely to follow the same path soon. Urgent calls, for example from the intergovernmental organization,\u00a0for the UK to engage with reparatory justice, are multiplying and are rapidly becoming impossible to ignore.We all have the urge to belong to something bigger than just ourselves, our family or our immediate community. But when the weight of your country\u2019s history becomes more like a burden than a badge of honor, how do you reconcile that with the desire to bond with your fellow citizens over a shared love of your homeland and of each other?As a Black American, this is a struggle with which I have long grappled. It is hard to feel loyalty toward the nation that enslaved your ancestors or committed atrocities in your ancestors\u2019 name. The answer, for me, has always been threefold: acknowledgement, reparation, hope. It means facing up to the wrongs of my country\u2019s past while experiencing great pride in my fellow Americans\u2019 efforts to put those wrongs right and never losing faith in our collective ability to build a more perfect union.While institutional structures and the British state need to be held to account for the atrocities of Britain\u2019s colonial past, the new monarch holds a unique dual position.If not as head of state, then at least as head of his own family, King Charles should now move beyond mere expressions of \u201c\u201d and acknowledge the role of his predecessors in colonialism and slavery by issuing a formal apology. He should then seek to repair the damage done by embarking on a transparent process of reparatory justice such as.Someof slave owners have already taken similar steps. If the sovereign joins them, other such families, organizations and eventually the UK government\u00a0()\u00a0will surely follow suit.If that happens, Charles might yet, like his mother at the time of her coronation, become the living embodiment of a nation\u2019s hope for a better, fairer future at home and abroad. And perhaps his son\u2019s coronation will take place in a country in which patriotism is honest and forward-looking, diversity is a source of genuine pride untainted by racial injustice and all the king\u2019s subjects know what it means to be British."

        "text": "Investigators have identified Gold Medal flour as the source of a salmonella outbreak that has infected at least 13 people in 12 states, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Monday.General Mills announced last week that it\u2019s recalling 2-, 5- and 10-pound bags of bleached and unbleached all-purpose Gold Medal flour that have a \u201cbetter if used by date\u201d of March 27 or 28, 2024.Of eight people interviewed by health officials, seven reported eating raw dough or batter,. \u201cAll six people who remembered the brand of flour they used reported Gold Medal All-Purpose Flour, and [the US Food and Drug Administration] found the outbreak strain in Gold Medal flour collected from a General Mills facility in Missouri.\u201dGeneral Mills issues voluntary recall for some types of popular flour brandThree people have been hospitalized in connection with the outbreak, but no deaths have been reported. The CDC notes that the true number of illnesses is probably higher because some people who recover without medical care don\u2019t get tested for salmonella and because it usually takes weeks to link illnesses with an outbreak.Salmonella usually causes diarrhea, fever and stomach cramps within six hours to six days of consuming the bacteria. Most people recover without treatment within a week, but those who are younger, who are older or who have weakened immune systems may develop severe illness.Consumers who have the recalled flour should throw it away or return it to the point of purchase, and wash any surfaces or containers that may have come into contact with it.every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.General Mills spokesperson Mollie Wulff said in a statement last week, \u201cWe are continuing to educate consumers that flour is not a \u2018ready to eat\u2019 ingredient. Anything made with flour must be cooked or baked before eating.\u201dMost flour is raw and hasn\u2019t been treated to kill germs that cause food poisoning, according to the CDC. Salmonella bacteria dies when it is cooked or baked, but people can get sick when eating or tasting foods that include raw flour. Raw dough used for crafts and play clay also pose a risk.The CDC advises baking or cooking any foods made with any brand of raw flour before eating. Thoroughly wash hands, bowls, utensils and surfaces after using raw flour. If making play dough at home, use heat-treated flour."

        "link": "https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/06/opinions/equal-rights-amendment-equality-impossible-bianco/index.html",
        "text": "Editor\u2019s Note: Marcie\u00a0Bianco is author of the forthcoming book \u201c\u201d The views expressed here are her own. Readon CNN.The\u00a0Equal Rights Amendment (ERA),that equal rights under the law cannot be denied on account of sex,\u00a0has been in a perpetual state of limbo for 100 years. Originally written by suffragists Alice Paul and Crystal Eastman and first introduced into Congress in 1923, last week in the US Senate, there were not even enough votes toto lift the 1982 deadline\u00a0for full ratification by the states\u00a0for its adoption into the US Constitution.In the intervening years since 1977, whenstates required to amend the Constitution\u00a0ratified the ERA, six states (Idaho, Kentucky, Nebraska, Tennessee, South Dakota and West Virginia) rescinded their ratifications, rendering the ERA\u2019s constitutional validity questionable even if the Senate had mustered the requisite 60 votes to waive the deadline.In the US, an equal rights amendment may never become law. And worldwide,\u00a0those dreaming of gender equality will have to wait another, according to the latest United Nations estimates. Arguably, billionaires will land on Mars before we achieve gender equality.With odds like those, it\u2019s well worth asking: What does \u201cachieve gender equality\u201d even? Laws can exist on the books, but how they are implemented and practiced determine their collective impact. It\u2019s past time to give up the ghost of equality and pursue a goal that has hope of transforming women\u2019s lives for the better: freedom. Doing so means accepting that achieving equality is impossible.Equality isn\u2019t impossible simply because the people in power won\u2019t give it to us. It is impossible because it cannot be faithfully implemented in supremacist and capitalist institutions created by men, for men. Our institutions are fundamentally conservative and were established to preserve the status quo.Including women in our existing institutions does not fundamentally change those institutions but only expands them, swallowing women and demanding we conform to the rules and values of those institutions.\u00a0As feminist writer Jill Filipovic, \u201cWomen can\u2019t flourish in a system that needs us as support pillars for someone else\u2019s building. We\u2019re here to prop it up, not live in it. This is not a place that was built for us to thrive.\u201dEven when equality is written into the Constitution \u2014 say, in the form of two amendments granting enfranchisement for all citizens (18 and older and who have not been incarcerated) \u2014 it is not guaranteed or protected in practice. From the moment the Fifteenth Amendment gave Black men the right to vote, there have been state-sanctioned and citizen-led efforts to prevent them from voting and from their votes counting, from gerrymandering to voter restrictions, tointimidating voters at polling sites.\u00a0This isn\u2019t to deny the\u00a0tangible benefits of the law, but we must acknowledge that White supremacy remains firmly rooted in our institutions and our society in ways that compromise the promise of even so-called \u201cconstitutionally protected\u201d rights, from voting to abortion.Opinion: We won\u2019t win the CHIPS race if women and people of color stay on the sidelinesWe suffer from an equality mindset that has resulted in a shortsighted politics that feels so deeply detached from people\u2019s needs, especially in light of the increasing number of legislative attacks aimed at eradicating and limiting our freedom, from the freedom to control our bodies to the freedom to move and cross state lines in search of health care. In service of the status quo, equality has\u00a0become the political cudgel of conservatives\u00a0seeking to undermine the human dignity and self-determination of women and marginalized people.Recent legislative and judicial trends indicate equality\u2019s increasingly overt weaponization. Take, for example, thethat have banned trans athletes from participating in school sports. Such legislation leverages a gender-essentialist interpretation of Title IX \u2014 which prohibits sex discrimination in federally funded educational institutions\u2014 to claim that allowing trans girls to compete in sports discriminates against cisgender girls because, the essentialist argument goes, gender is biological and therefore immutable. Hence we see the language of equality, primarily that of \u201c\u201d in the name of \u201cprotecting\u201d or \u201csaving\u201d girls\u2019 sports, as a defining feature of these bans.Meanwhile, Democrats and progressives have largely failed to translate equality legislation into lasting change in people\u2019s lives, through either continued structural supports or cultural messaging.\u00a0And that\u2019s when their legislation even becomes law in the first place \u2014 Democrats in the Senate in recent years have lacked the collective will to pass legislation inor, for instance. For years, some progressivesabortion rights as a niche issue\u00a0(even at times refusing to say the word),\u00a0while othersthe staggering vulnerability left by pinning abortion-rights efforts to federal, not state, access.Regardless of party affiliation or political ideology, the equality mindset too often consists of a one and done \u2013 or won and done \u2013 mentality, a belief that once an equal right is \u201cwon,\u201d there is little to no effort required to do the work necessary to\u00a0make it a practical reality. But rights only have meaning and impact in their doing and in their living.All of these realities only sharpen the need to ask:Why are we fighting for inclusion into systems and institutions that were built upon our oppression? Why have we limited the scope of our political vision and ethics to equality, as men have defined it?Why are women waiting for men \u2014 who are the majority of our politicians, justices and judges \u2014 to benevolently bestow equality unto us?We could stop playing by men\u2019s rules. We can decide that equality isn\u2019t good enough.Many feminists and proponents of the ERA cite abortion as central to their fight for the amendment\u2019s passage. But\u00a0abortion and issues pertaining to bodily autonomy, self-determination and human dignity of historically oppressed and marginalized people are not equality issues. Rather, these are matters of freedom.I do not mean the type of American freedom understood as the unfettered pursuit of one\u2019s desires, no matter their impact or consequence \u2014 what writerand historianhave called \u201cwhite freedom.\u201d I mean freedom defined as the ongoing process of self-creation and world-building rooted in accountability and care, because freedom is collectively \u2014 not individually \u2014 realized and experienced.Opinion: The cruel twist that harms women in the militaryFreedom is not carelessness but, and requires we hold ourselves accountable to care for each other. As Audre Lorde, echoing generations of Black freedom fighters and Black feminists before her,: \u201cI am not free while any woman is unfree, even when her shackles are very different from my own.\u201d My freedom is not limited by yours but broadened by it.And, our freedom is situated \u2014 distinct for each of us \u2014 based on the conditions of our lives.\u00a0Freedom acknowledges the reality that we\u00a0are not treated equally in society and in our institutions, and we are not born and do not die on equal terms.Practicing freedom is available to all of us, daily, in our choices and actions in how we engage with other people and choose to account for their human dignity.This looks like respecting people\u2019s human dignity, allowing them to fashion and become, for example, the woman of their\u00a0dreams, rather\u00a0than policing their gender identity and expression. Whereas an equality mindset reinforces the gender binary and limits women to a small box in opposition to men, a freedom mindset understands that the inclusion of trans athletes, for instance, elevates the competitive level of all women, and celebrates self-creation as the pinnacle of freedom.Practicing freedom is being careful with our words, both on and offline, because we understand that our words have power \u2014 our words affect other people. It is acknowledging that we are responsible for our own actions.While a politics of equality might argue that the best way to solve for mass-shootings in schools is to give teachers guns (so that everyone has a gun), a politics of freedom begins with the recognition that guns threaten our freedom and, specifically in the context of education, threaten children\u2019s ability and willingness to learn in school.Freedom work within our conservative institutions will inevitably face pushback. We witnessed this just last month with the\u00a0\u201d,\u201d who took to the floor of the Tennessee House of Representatives to petition their colleagues to take real action against gun violence in light of The Covenant School shooting in Nashville. Two of the three representatives \u2014 who are young\u00a0Black men \u2014 were expelled from the House for \u201c.\u201d (Both have been reappointed to their seats by their local officials.) Whereas equality efforts are complicit with institutional norms and values, freedom work is institutional defiance.From a freedom mindset grounded in accountability and care, abortion becomes part of reproductive health care. It isn\u2019t oversimplified as an equal right to make a single \u201cchoice.\u201d Abortion is never based on one choice but rather determined by a person\u2019s circumstances, personal and financial supports, age, aspirations and dreams for how they want to build their own family.All of this necessitates letting go of equality and an equality politics, built upon the patriarchal gender binary, of complicity and reliance on governments institutions to create a freer and more just world.\u00a0 It requires asking new questions. How might our politics change if we, finally, relinquish equality? How might doing so liberate us to become the women we want to become, on our own terms?"

        "text": "Many do not realize the defining role the Republican Party has played in our nation\u2019s history. It\u2019s a party built by visionary and, at times, rugged and individualistic leaders with bold ideas, such as President Abraham Lincoln\u2019s, President Dwight D. Eisenhower\u2019sand President Ronald Reagan\u2019s \u201c\u201d doctrine.These leaders motivated the American people to believe in themselves and to reach high to achieve their own American dreams. In doing so, they embodied the tenets of what is considered a classically conservative platform: limited government, fiscal responsibility, opportunity for all and the protection of individual liberties.Over the last eight years, we \u2014 as a party and as a nation \u2014 have forgotten the type of individual our forefathers intended the president of the United States of America to be. We have forgotten what it\u2019s like to live under the leadership of a president who looks forward, leads by example, instinctively puts the country before the party and has no issue setting ego aside to get things done.The actions taken by former President Donald Trump demonstrate that he has chosen not to govern by honoring our shared conservative values. Instead, he has undermined the fabric of our democracy by questioning theandto stir protesters on January 6, 2021.The problem? Once we started down that dark path, we, as Republicans, quickly lowered our standards. However, it\u2019s not good enough to occasionally stand on our principles. Rather, our principles should serve as our north star without exception.Opinion: The thing Republicans had better learn fastBut that\u2019s not the only way we\u2019ve lowered our standards. We\u2019ve done so when it comes to matters of public discourse. We should expect more from both our elected leaders and the Fourth Estate, the news media.We must no longer accept blatant bias and partisan bickering as the norm from politicians or media personalities. This starts by moving past the misguided notion that the media is an, a falsehood perpetuated by certain Republican leaders, like Trump, in recent years.Unfortunately, we have created a culture where many Americansjournalism for its pursuit of truth and knowledge. But the reality is journalists used to be giants in our society. They carried a mandate to inform the public, derived from their objective purpose: to hold the government accountable while seeking the truth. And they still carry that mandate today.At this moment in our nation\u2019s story, we cannot afford to elect leaders who are focused only on themselves or onwith political opponents. We need a consistent conservative who understands the limited role of government and believes in America as the beacon of freedom \u2014 including a free press \u2014 across the globe.If both parties intentionally repeat the 2020 presidential election by nominating Joe Biden and Trump, respectively, they will only perpetuate the current state of affairs in our country.I am a problem-solving conservative seeking the Republican nomination for president of the United States. However, the essential mantle I wear is that of an American willing to serve.Opinion: I don\u2019t love Biden, but I\u2019m terrified of TrumpThroughoutacross the country, I have found that the majority of the American people want the government to return to protecting liberty, spending tax money responsibly and understanding the more limited role it should play within their lives. I agree with that sentiment.I also believe that America is not defined by one person, just as one person does not represent the Republican Party. Instead, both America and the GOP are informed by a platform of policies, a legacy of leadership and a tradition of truth that empowers the American people to hold their government accountable, just as our Founding Fathers intended.Our system of government \u2014 the Great American Experiment \u2014 empowers we, the people, to elect someone to embody the values we share and apply them to shape policy for the greater good. If the peaceful transfer of power has taught us anything, it is that we elect leaders to represent our will, not to impose their own upon our lives.That is what sets the United States of America apart and has made us the envy of the free world. I am ready to serve as the leader who Americans \u2014 and the international community \u2014 can trust. I stand willing and able to protect our traditions and way of life at all costs.America deserves leadership focused on what lies before us \u2014 just over the horizon \u2014 rather than what is in our rearview mirror. The next president of the United States must be forward-focused to ensure prosperity for ourselves and our children.I am running for president of the United States of America because I believe that governing through the concept of being consistently conservative is not a complicated one; it is common sense.It is vitally important that we return to commonsense solutions rather than divisive rhetoric. This will once again elevate the level of debate within our country and offer a course correction for the Republican Party.The American people will measure our character and positions while considering who should be the next leader of our country. They will weigh the motives that drive us to run for public office. I hope the voters will make a judgment based on a new vision for America and the shared values that got us to this moment in history.Our future as a free country is unlimited, but much is still at stake."

        "text": "Editor\u2019s Note:The views expressed in this commentary are his own. Readarticle on CNN.I arrived in Sudan from my home in Pittsburgh on April 12 to bury my father, one day after he passed. At my mother\u2019s house in Khartoum, friends and family kept us company, mourning with us and exchanging stories late into the night.On April 14, in the final week of Ramadan, we gathered in our yard to break our fast when the sun set. A few hours later, we were jolted awake by a sound that shook the entire house.It was nothing more than an accident, I thought. After all, my family lived on one of the busiest streets in a packed city. Accidents happen all the time.But the explosions kept coming, one after another. I looked outside to try to make sense of the commotion, when I saw dozens of Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) pickup trucks racing past us towards the airport, with dozens more belonging to their rivals, the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), in close pursuit. Only then did I realize that my family and I were trapped in the middle of a war zone in the heart of Khartoum.Sudan had suffered for decades under the heavy hand of autocratic rule. In 2019, an uprising by the Sudanese people spurred the SAF and RSF tolongtime dictator Omar al-Bashir from power.At long last, there was a glimmer of hope for democracy in Sudan. Yet that, too, was snuffed out when the SAF and RSFthe civilian prime minister with whom they shared power as part of a purported transitionary phase toward democracy.Ever since, the SAF and RSF have jointly ruled with continuous tensions between the two factions. Both groups continued toa new agreement that would revamp the process to put Sudan on the path to civilian rule.As part of the final resolution being negotiated alongside Sudan\u2019s political parties, it was decided that the RSF, which essentially operated independently as an armed militia, would fold into the army under the banner of the SAF. Eventually, those simmering hostilitiesinto an all-out conflict.Sudan\u2019s warring military factions to meet face-to-face for first time since conflict beganOnce the bombs started falling on April 14, the next 10 days would mark the defining moments of my life. If my experience in Sudan is any indication, the US response to this catastrophe has been slow, haphazard and insufficient at every level. But it\u2019s not too late to change course.We lost electricity almost immediately, while the strikes became more and more ferocious. We learned to differentiate each terrifying sound of war: screaming fighter jets in the skies, attack helicopters buzzing overhead, sprays of automatic gunfire rippling through the neighborhood.The RSF indiscriminately lobbed\u00a0anti-aircraft missiles that crashed into homes and onto the streets. Every time I heard those earth-splitting explosions, I was convinced that our house was hit until proven otherwise.We all huddled on our living room floor: My mom, my two brothers and two sisters, my aunt and uncle. Out of sheer necessity we would reassure each other, telling ourselves that somehow, some way, this would pass and we would be okay. But like clockwork, air fighters would resume their attacks at dawn, so we stayed put.I looked for any distraction I could find, throwing myself into my work coordinating the Sudanese American Physician Association\u2019s (SAPA) operations supporting health care facilities countrywide.The field reports I received from my colleagues were harrowing: Hospitals bombed to rubble, ambulances dodging gunfire, mounting civilian deaths. One colleagueto manually pump oxygen into a patient after the power was cut; tragically, 24 hours of frantic pumping wasn\u2019t enough to save him.The seventh day of fighting was the day I thought we were going to die. Gunfire and explosions roared all around us for 18 hours straight. My sisters cried all day. I frantically texted my wife back home in Pittsburgh, telling her everything I knew about our assets and accessing life insurance. US citizens that I know desperately tried to reach US\u00a0embassy officials and received the same copy-and-paste response:\u00a0We\u00a0can\u2019t help you now, shelter where you are.Sudan\u2019s first professional stage actress killed in shelling in KhartoumSomehow, again, we made it through the night, and at a moment of relative calm, I found our front yard littered with dozens of bullet shells. I collected each one and hid them from my family; that was the last thing they needed to see. I decided then and there that the US was not coming to save us \u2013 it was time to flee Khartoum or die trying.We called everyone we could think of to arrange transport in hopes of boarding a ship in Port Sudan. The one driver willing to take us insisted we meet him on the outskirts of the city. We scrambled to find a van, buckled up, and began driving for the longest 45 minutes of our entire lives.For those 45 minutes traversing the city, I got the full picture of the destruction wrought by the warring sides, both content to burn Khartoum to the ground for the sake of power. The silence was haunting, a scene out of a horror movie: abandoned cars ablaze; scores of dead bodies rotting in the streets; RSF soldiers glaring and pointing their guns directly at us.When we reached the bus driver, he told us to hide our identification cards \u2013 if the RSF discovered that I was a doctor, they would kidnap me and force me to treat their wounded. Over the course of the 11-hour journey to Port Sudan, we were stopped at gunpoint four times, with RSF soldiers threatening to shoot us if they found we belonged to their rival side. By the grace of God, we arrived intact.US officials had assured us personally that we would be able to evacuate by ship. But one day passed, and then another, and then another. There were no American ships to be found. The humanitarian situation deteriorated by the day, with thousands of refugees flooding into the city. People were sleeping on the streets and collapsing from dehydration, with nowhere to turn for help.Five days later my family and I managed to squeeze our way onto a ship arranged by the Royal Saudi Navy and Saudi embassy. I write this sitting safe and sound in Saudi Arabia. Even after all of that heartache and terror, I am one of the lucky ones.As a resident of the United States, this entire experience has been confounding. Not once did US\u00a0officials clearly communicate, provide useful guidance, or make any effort to protect us. While other countrieson the first ceasefire to start evacuating citizens, the US initiallyonly embassy staff and diplomats.Meanwhile, the entire health care sector in Sudan is on the brink of collapse. SAPA and our partners are doing everything we can to keep people alive, but we desperately need support. We are running out of medical supplies that make the difference between life and death \u2013 providing basic emergency kits would be but a drop in the bucket for the US.On the diplomatic front, the US\u00a0has significant leverage among the warring factions and Sudan\u2019s neighboring countries. It\u2019s time to use it. Egypt, one of theof US foreign aid, isan untold number of refugees on the border. Why would we tolerate such callous behavior from a so-called ally?Then there is the matter of those still left languishing in Sudan. While US officials have in recent daysefforts to evacuate those fleeing, there are stillof Americans waiting to be rescued. And their initial response left so many of us to fend for ourselves under the most horrific conditions.When I encountered fellow US\u00a0residents and Americans along my journey, we wondered aloud why the US\u00a0government had abandoned us. The only explanation we could come up with is that even as patriotic Americans and health care workers \u2013 honest and hardworking taxpayers who give back to our communities \u2013 we are considered third-class citizens. I pray that the Biden administration will do everything in its power in the weeks and months to come to prove us wrong."

        "text": "Come spring, avid gardeners dig into the new growing season ready with careful cultivation plans they dreamed up over long winters. But even city-dwelling non-planners can benefit from year-round botanical bounty. They just need to learn what, where and how to harvest the wild foods growing in lawns, parks and scrubby backlots.Chickweed, dandelion and dock provide delicious, nutrient-rich greens, while daylilies, lilacs, honeysuckle and roses can add floral overtones to syrups, jellies and baked goods. Protein-packed wild plants and plant parts include purslane, acorns and brown dock seeds. Teas and tinctures made from ground ivy, gingko and golden rod, along with many other \u201cweeds\u201d and invasive species, can serve various medicinal purposes, once properly prepared.Here's how many times you need to reuse your reusable grocery bagsIn her book \u201c,\u201d herbalist and expert forageroffers guidance on safely identifying, gathering and preparing edible flora that grow wild in most major US cities.\u201cGathering your own food to make dinner can help instill a sense of place,\u201d she said. She maintains that highlighting the role of wild plants in our food system can teach us to heal our soil, our waterways and our own public health. In this way, urban foraging creates new potential for greener, healthier and more sustainable ecosystems.\u201cOh my gosh, you can EAT those?\u201d pretty much sums up the thrill of urban foraging. Showing people all the edible plants that grow in cities helps connect them with the natural world.It\u2019s revolutionary to think differently of the unloved weeds and see opportunity in the neglected spaces that people pass by. The most fun, engaging thing is to get back outside and reconnect with the happiness that a dandelion flower can bring. Reinhabiting our 8-year-old, judgment-free selves allows us to recognize an elemental, earthly kind of beauty without the preconceived notions.Plus, wild plants have a unique function in the ecosystem. Even so-called invasive species can remediate the soil and water. They help to repair areas that have been leveled and left open to erosion by creating a structure that keeps the soil from blowing away. Soil is the building block of human health, and it needs a rich, diverse base of organic material to be able to give us nutritious food.My family is from Flint, Michigan. I take soil and water contamination issues very seriously. The first steps to safe urban foraging are knowing where to harvest \u2014 including researching the history of the land, if possible \u2014 and learning which plants and plant parts may be more likely to contain contaminants like heavy metals or pollutants.Nettles, for example, are apt to take up heavy metals like lead. So, I recommend harvesting these only from places free of soil contamination. The key is to take caution and be judicious. But remember, given the realities of our industrialized food system, the plants available at a commercial supermarket often have layers of pesticides. We don\u2019t live in a perfect world.Also, it sounds silly, but when it comes to plants or mushrooms, if you don\u2019t know what it is, don\u2019t pick it, and definitely don\u2019t put it in your mouth!As you observe an environment and learn what plants could be edible, make the effort to learn further: Is this endangered? Threatened? An invasive species? We want to consider, ethically, the plant\u2019s distribution and the habitat.I rarely feel badly when I pick my garlic mustard. It\u2019s going to come back. But when it comes to foraging by greengrocers and restaurants, it\u2019s important to consider that there\u2019s only so much the ecosystems can offer at that retail level. Where are these items coming from? How do I ensure no habitat destruction happens under the name of foraging trends? We have a long way to go in creating regionally based food systems that would help all of us, including our restaurants and grocers.It\u2019s impossible to decouple social justice from human health. Food-system inequities have a massive impact on access to nutrients and effects on human health.An organism used as fire starter for centuries could replace some plastics, study findsAbout\u2014 a wicked problem that foraging, gardening and local food systems cannot solve alone. But, restoring foodways \u2014 even simply refining how to cook basic things \u2014 can play a powerful part in increasing food access. Urban foraging is an effort to democratize the wild plants to make them more available to more people. You don\u2019t have to be classically trained as a botanist at university. These are basic human skills.Not significantly, given the current populations and designs of our cities. It\u2019s inconceivable and unethical for me to suggest that all of Manhattan go and use Central Park as their greengrocer. But intentionally designing more green space can create the possibility for more available food for city communities within a smaller footprint.Yes! Harvesting must be done in context of your growing zone, of course, but part of the endeavor is to recognize what your landscape can provide. Even on frigid January and February days, foragers can find bark, buds and sap. Consider how, for millennia, indigenous communities supported a basic diet with fresh and stored wild foods. In many traditions, for example, acorns \u2014 high in carbohydrates and protein \u2014 played a significant role in helping to extend harvests to provide food for the winter.Acorns are a quintessential forager\u2019s food that can be used in soups, pulverized into a nut butter or ground into flour for baking. Every fall, I process enough acorns to make 10 to 15 pounds of flour, with the help of neighbors who drop off bags full or team up to shell them while we chat over cocktails and cheese. Later, we share the acorn bread I bake, which is kind of my signature.Makes 1 loafIngredientsInstructionsPrepare the flourBake the breadWe\u2019ve arrived at a big crossroads. At no other time has our human population had to face and address a rapidly changing climate across the globe. This affects our water systems, our food systems, even determining where we can live \u2014 as evidenced by migrations of people moving away from the shores of lakes and oceans.Saving water can help us deal with the climate crisis. Here's how to reduce your useUrban foraging for wild plants helps us rethink how we live alongside the natural world, looking at habitat loss. We can learn a lot simply by honing our ability to observe the little dandelion or the patch of cattails along the riverside. How might we add back our green spaces that can build soil, support the biodiversity that we need and bring forward our pollinators?You can\u2019t be what you don\u2019t see. If you don\u2019t have a connection to the water, a farmers market, a vegetable garden or to considering what that dandelion might be doing in the soil, how could you ever become a climate-conscious Earth protector, a steward of the ecosystem?Foraging helps us pay closer attention, which helps us to reestablish a more caring and less extractive relationship with the natural world."

        "text": "The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services is investigating two hospitals that \u201cdid not offer necessary stabilizing care to an individual experiencing an emergency medical condition, in violation of the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA),\u201d according tofrom US Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra.Under EMTALA, health care professionals are required to \u201coffer treatment, including abortion care, that the provider reasonably determines is necessary to stabilize the patient\u2019s emergency medical condition,\u201d Becerra said Monday in his letter to national hospital and provider associations.Biden administration says federal law preempts state abortion bans when emergency care is neededThe, which said in a statement that it filed the initial EMTALA complaint on behalf of Mylissa Farmer, identified the hospitals as Freeman Hospital West of Joplin, Missouri, and the University of Kansas Health System in Kansas City, Kansas.The patient was nearly 18 weeks pregnant when she had a preterm premature rupture of membranes, Becerra wrote, but she was told that her pregnancy wasn\u2019t viable.\u201cAlthough her doctors advised her that her condition could rapidly deteriorate, they also advised that they could not provide her with the care that would prevent infection, hemorrhage, and potentially death because, they said, the hospital policies prohibited treatment that could be considered an abortion,\u201d Becerra wrote.Becerra added in a statement Monday, \u201cfortunately, this patient survived. But she never should have gone through the terrifying ordeal she experienced in the first place. We want her, and every patient out there like her, to know that we will do everything we can to protect their lives and health, and to investigate and enforce the law to the fullest extent of our legal authority.\u201dHHS secretary says 'everything is on the table' in response to medication abortion rulingAbortion is banned in Missouri, with limited exceptions, such as to save the mother\u2019s life. State law requires counseling and a 72-hour waiting period. In Kansas, abortion is generally banned at or after 22 weeks of pregnancy, with a 24-hour waiting period and counseling required.Passed in 1986, EMTALA requires that hospitals provide stabilizing treatment to patients who have emergency medical conditions, or transfer them to facilities where such care will be provided, regardless of any conflicting state laws or mandates.Changes to state laws in the wake of the US Supreme Court decision that overturned the right to an abortion have left many hospitals and providers uncertain or confused about the steps they can legally take in such cases. HHSlast year reaffirming that EMTALA requires providers to offer stabilizing care in emergency cases, which might include abortion.Hospitals found to be in violation of EMTALA could lose their Medicare and Medicaid provider agreements and could face civil penalties. An individual physician could also face civil penalties if they are found to be in violation.Texas challenges HHS guidance that pharmacies can't turn away people who have a prescription for a drug that may end a pregnancyHHS may impose a $119,942 fine per violation for hospitals with more than 100 beds and $59,973 for hospitals with fewer than 100 beds. A physician could face a $119,942 fine per violation.The National Women\u2019s Law Center says the new actions are the first time since Roe v. Wade was overturned that EMTALA has been enforced against a hospital that denied emergency abortion care.\u201cThe care provided to the patient was reviewed by the hospital and found to be in accordance with hospital policy,\u201d the University of Kansas Health System said in a statement to CNN. \u201cIt met the standard of care based upon the facts known at the time, and complied with all applicable law. There is a process with CMS for this complaint and we respect that process. The University of Kansas Health System follows federal and Kansas law in providing appropriate, stabilizing, and quality care to all of its patients, including obstetric patients.\u201devery Tuesday from the CNN Health team.Freeman Hospital did not immediately respond to CNN\u2019s request for comment.An HHS spokesperson told CNN that both hospitals are working toward coming into compliance with the law.In the law center\u2019s statement, Farmer said she was pleased with the investigations, \u201cbut pregnant people across the country continue to be denied care and face increased risk of complications or death, and it must stop. I was already dealing with unimaginable loss and the hospitals made things so much harder. I\u2019m still struggling emotionally with what happened to me, but I am determined to keep fighting because no one should have to go through this.\u201d"

        "name": "What kind of justice will Ketanji Brown Jackson be?",
        "link": "https://edition.cnn.com/2022/02/25/opinions/scotus-justice-ketanji-brown-jackson-opinion/index.html",
        "text": "Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson is an eminently qualified public servant with distinguished experience as a federal judge, and her historic nomination promises an end to the erasure of Black women from our most sacred legal institutions. She brings extensive litigation experience at every level of the federal court system, including distinguished service as a federal public defender. As a district court judge, she ruled on over 550 cases and is renowned for her careful, methodical approach to ensuring equal justice under the law on reproductive rights, disability rights and workers\u2019 rights.Frankly, this is a nomination that should unite the country. Diversity strengthens the integrity of the institution to the broader public and, in particular, the many Black women who face many of the harshest injustices of our system today. It\u2019s critical for the US Supreme Court to understand the impact of its rulings in the real world, and it can\u2019t do that until it reflects the country it governs. Jackson will move us closer to a more fair and just system for women, for Black Americans and for everyone on the side of equality before the law.It is incumbent upon US senators to give her a fair and timely confirmation without obstruction, honoring their constitutional duty to advise and consent \u2013 and their moral duty to treat her with the respect and dignity she deserves.First things first: it\u2019s about time. It\u2019s long past time. For the first time in the history of the US Supreme Court, a Black woman has been nominated as a Justice.And, to be clear, you will not find athan Judge (likely soon-to-be Justice) Kentaji Brown Jackson. She graduated from Harvard, both undergrad and law school. She clerked for a federal district court judge and then, in a nice bit of symmetry, nabbed a mega-prestigious clerkship with Justice Stephen Breyer, who she now stands to replace.Shein private practice and for the US Sentencing Commission before she became a federal district court judge in 2013. Last year, she was nominated as a, winning confirmation with 53 votes, including three Republicans. I haveon the bench, and I came away exceptionally impressed. In the case I covered, she was prepared, sharp, incisive and fair.Senate Republicans can act one of two ways in the wake of Jackson\u2019s nomination. They can dig in and oppose it, but they don\u2019t have much of substance to work with \u2013 and they\u2019ll likely lose anyway, given the current Democratic Senate majority (which will presumably be coupled with the votes of three Republicans who supported her federal appellate judgeship).Or Republicans can pick their battles and throw their support behind Jackson, given her qualifications and the seeming inevitably of her confirmation. Maybe it seems quaint \u2013 Breyer himselfby an 87 to 9 vote back in 1994, which now seems impossible \u2013 but it also could be smart politics.In selecting Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson to fill Stephen Breyer\u2019s seat on the Supreme Court, President Joe Biden has fulfilled histo nominate the first female African American justice.Biden selected Jackson for additional reasons, of course. Jackson has impressive credentials, and Biden likely feels confident that Jackson will implement the results-oriented, make-it-up-as-you-go-along  \u201cliving constitutionalism\u201d that progressives espouse.Biden has already demonstrated that differences in judicial philosophy justify efforts to oppose the confirmation of the first female African American justice. Back in 2005, he evenPresident George W. Bush\u2019s possible nomination of DC Circuit judge Janice Rogers Brown to the Supreme Court.The left is likely to make accusations of racism and sexism in response to any concerns expressed over Jackson\u2019s vision of the judicial role. But if Senate Republicans assess Jackson on the basis of judicial philosophy, and don\u2019t succumb to political pressure because of her race and sex, they will responsibly fulfill their constitutional duty to advise and consent.The Democrats have control of the Senate, albeit slim control, so Jackson will almost certainly be confirmed. The process will probably be rather quiet. But Senate Republicans should use the opportunity to emphasize that judging is a craft that is distinct from policymaking. They can reinforce the message that the duty of a Supreme Court justice is to discern and apply the meaning that constitutional and statutory provisions bore when they were adopted, not to rewrite those provisions to advance an ideological agenda.For me, the power of seeing a Black woman nominated to the highest court in the land is without equal. But what is also extraordinary is that she will be a former federal public defender \u2013 a position she held for\u2013 in a country with a legal system still aspiring to be a justice system.As a prosecutor, I wielded a tremendous amount of power in the exercise of my discretion to pursue (or decline to pursue) charges and autonomy in the way I met my burden of proof. But like the power held by a co-equal branch of government, the power of prosecutors must be checked \u2013 not to disrupt the pursuit of justice but to further it. In a country where race and bias are far too frequently elevated above fairness, public defenders are the welcome foil to balance the system.The relationship between public defenders and prosecutors may be necessarily adversarial, but it is always symbiotic. Prosecutors get all the credit (and blame) for ensuring accountability, as if they alone believe in it.The public may mistakenly view those who represent the accused as soft on crime. Indeed, if past is prologue, I expect such an absurd talking point to emerge during Jackson\u2019s confirmation hearings. But public defenders are not soft on crime \u2013 they are hard on injustice, which is precisely where we as a society must be. And precisely where a Supreme Court justice ought to be.I sincerely hope Jackson is afforded the dignity she ensured for the presumed innocent: due process, fairness, equal protection from an abuse of power and a meaningful opportunity to be heard. After all, it\u2019s the US Supreme Court.One thing that\u2019s always said when there\u2019s a US Supreme Court nomination is that presidents are often surprised by how their choices turn out. Presidents think the future justice will vote one way, and they wind up voting another way.Don\u2019t believe it. Especially in recent years, the art of picking Supreme Court justices has been refined to a science. All nine of the current justices largely vote in ways that would please the presidents who nominated them. That\u2019s likely to be true if Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson is confirmed as well.The myth of the surprised president dates principally from the presidency of Dwight Eisenhower, who nominated Earl Warren and William Brennan to the Supreme Court and found, to his dismay, that they were both powerful and outspoken liberals.Here\u2019s one thing to know about the Eisenhower administration: it was a long time ago. In those days, the court was not the public political battleground that it has become, and Eisenhower\u2019s choices were motivated more by politics than ideology. (Eisenhowerthe seat to Warren, then the governor of California, and heBrennan to appeal to Catholic voters on the eve of his 1956 reelection.)It\u2019s true that President George H.W. Bush\u2019s appointment of David Souter in 1990 ranks as a modest surprise, but his behavior as a moderate on the court was consistent with both his own earlier record as a judge and Bush\u2019s overall approach to social issues. Also, 1990 was a long time ago.In recent years, though, as the court has become the focus of fights on such issues as abortion, guns and affirmative action, ideology has become the main criteria for selections. Presidents (as well as their advisers and supporters) care a great deal about the possibility of ideological mistakes. So they don\u2019t make them. President Joe Biden wanted a judicial liberal, and that\u2019s what he will get with Jackson. She will not surprise him, or us.Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson\u2019s nomination is an important step in addressing the injustices in the US judicial system, but it\u2019s not the only step we need to take. America\u2019s legal system has always looked different for Black women, who have historically been discriminated against. That will not change until we see more Black women jurists like Jackson in positions of legal power, and that begins with empowering Black women to be the leaders  they deserve to be.Jackson is the ideal role model in this regard. Her record is one that has championed equity and justice . She fought to defend the rights of incarcerated individuals, issued rulings that protected labor and women\u2019s rights and upheld the integrity of our constitution when it was under attack by the Trump administration.Along with her wealth of judicial expertise, she also brings with her experiences and identities that have never been enjoyed by another Supreme Court justice \u2013 and have been sorely missed in the highest court in America. I look forward to her swift approval process through the US Senate and hopefully to her being seated on a bench that doesn\u2019t require her to bring her own folding chair.President Joe Biden simply could not have done better than his choice of Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson for the United States Supreme Court. In the world of law, credentials don\u2019t get better than hers. A graduate of Harvard College and Harvard Law School, she clerked for judges in the federal district court and the federal court of appeals. She was also a clerk for Justice Stephen Breyer, who she is now poised to replace. Jackson has had extensive experience in a variety of settings and has served as a federal judge since 2013.She also brings to the court experiences and perspectives the current justices lack. Most obviously, she is the first Black woman to be nominated to the Supreme Court. If confirmed, Jackson will also be the only justice on the current court to have worked as a public defender. She has significant experience as a trial judge, something only Justice Sonia Sotomayor has among those now on the high court.As I think about what makes for a great justice, Jackson has it all: keen intelligence, enormous experience, unquestionable integrity, a terrific judicial temperament and a vision of justice. She should be confirmed swiftly by the Senate and start what will hopefully be a long career on the Supreme Court. Many will rightfully point out the fact that she won\u2019t change the current ideological balance of the court by replacing Breyer. But if Jackson is still a justice in 2040 and 2050, she may be a stabilizing force on a very different court.Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson, President Joe Biden\u2019s nominee to fill the retiring Justice Stephen Breyer\u2019s seat on the Supreme Court, has it all. She is a highly accomplished lawyer and an experienced jurist with the sterling educational and clerkship credentials expected of someone about to ascend to the pinnacle of the legal profession. And, as a Black woman, Jackson will bring a historic perspective and important representation to the nation\u2019s highest court.Jackson shares all of the above characteristics with the other two final candidates Biden was considering:and.  All three women are also 55 or under; nominating someone relatively young has become close to mandatory in recent years for Supreme Court nominees of presidents of both parties since justices can serve for life. But what distinguishes Jackson from the others, and what very well may have led to her selection, is her service as a criminal defense lawyer, both as a. She offers the kind of professional diversity that has become one of the calling cards of Biden\u2019s judicial nominations strategy.Biden is right to prioritize elevating judges who bring different backgrounds and experiences to the courts, especially to the Supreme Court, where not a single justice has Jackson\u2019s experience defending criminal cases. The Supreme Court needs more diversity, of all kinds; hopefully Jackson will be the first step in making that become a reality.The legal profession is plagued by elitism. It\u2019s easy for me to say this, having attended Ivy League schools myself, but prestigious academic institutions do not confer much of anything that can\u2019t be gained from other schools.Of the nine justices currently on the Supreme Court, however, eight have degrees from Harvard or Yale. If confirmed, Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson, who has two Harvard degrees, will perpetuate the Ivies\u2019 dominance on the Supreme Court.While I will be the first to argue that the Supreme Court desperately needs justices with more varied educational backgrounds, in Jackson\u2019s case, her credentials from an elite institution are a good thing.Here\u2019s why. Shortly after President Joe Biden announced he would fulfill his promise to put a Black woman on the court \u2013 an uncontroversial statement givencommitments to make barrier-breaking nominations  \u2013 a US senator went on the record to call the eventual nominee a \u201c\u201d of affirmative action. Another senator expressed doubts about whether the nominee\u201ca law book from a J. Crew catalog.\u201d A prominent conservative took to Twitter and predicted the nomineea \u201clesser black woman.\u201d (He later deleted the tweets and apologized, calling it \u201cinartful.\u201d)At their cores, each of these statements was a manifestation of disbelief that \u2013 gasp! \u2013 a Black woman might be just as qualified as any other previous nominee to serve on the Supreme Court.Black people face enough barriers in workplaces as it is. For instance, job applicants with \u201cBlack-sounding\u201d names areto get interviewed than their White counterparts, and Black women with natural hairstyles are seen as. I speak firsthand in saying that being Black and successful in America is a constant exercise in having to prove you are worthy. That struggle doesn\u2019t end in the marble halls of the Supreme Court.If, today, Jackson\u2019s having two Harvard degrees and an otherwise airtight resume is what it takes to quiet at least some of the criticism, then so be it.In Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson, President Joe Biden has put forth a US Supreme Court nominee with impeccable credentials and a stellar legal background.In addition to her degrees from Harvard College and Harvard Law School, she brings diverse professional experience to the high court; she has worked at large and small firms, as a public defender, and served on the US Sentencing Commission, where sheto reduce federal drug trafficking sentences. This type of varied experience will serve her well on a court that often seems out of touch and has seen its public approval rating drop.According to, the majority of African Americans say it\u2019s very or extremely important that a Black woman serves on the Supreme Court, and the President has now delivered on a key promise.Jackson will likely earn support fromas well, as our communities have much in common in the struggle for civil rights and social justice.Jackson\u2019s rulings on immigration are also important, as congressional inaction and legal challenges to immigration policy have given the Supreme Court an outsized role on this issue.Although in several cases shethe rights of migrants, she alsoto Trump\u2019s border wall \u2013 so no one can accuse her of favoring \u201copen borders.\u201d Most importantly, whether ruling for or against migrants, Jackson has avoided using terms like \u201cillegals\u201d or \u201caliens.\u201d As the National Immigration Law Center, this acknowledges the basic humanity of immigrants.The Supreme Court holds immense power over our daily lives, on issues ranging from health care to the environment to reproductive and voting rights. At a time when many Americans have lost faith in institutions, Jackson will help restore trust and stability to the high court. Her historic nomination deserves bipartisan support.President Joe Biden\u2019s nomination of Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson as the first Black woman Supreme Court nominee in the court\u2019s history is a tremendous moment for America. After a rigorous process, Jackson has proven that she has the experience and character to do this vital job.As a Black woman, I am thrilled for what this means for me, my daughter and my community.While I rejoice in the historic nature of her nomination, I also want to celebrate the incredible qualifications Jackson brings to this role. A, she went to Harvard Law School, has served in nearly every part of our legal system and brings that kind of well-rounded experience that we need on the highest court. It\u2019s no wonder that she has beenon a bipartisan vote.Unfortunately, even being an impeccably qualified nominee who has been praised by bothfor being an \u201cunwavering voice for justice and fairness\u201d and by, who gave her \u201cunequivocal\u201d praise for her integrity and intellect, Jackson will almost certainly face racist and sexist comments that come with being the first.At EMILY\u2019s List, we have seen far too many history-makers and ground-breakers have their accomplishments questioned and their qualifications undermined. But we know what Jackson\u2019s example proves: to be the first and to break the mold, you bring qualifications, experience and character that is unrivaled.I am proud to support her and look forward to the legacy she will hopefully create on the court.Every US Supreme Court nomination presents an opportunity for Americans and our elected leaders to reflect on the court\u2019s crucial, singular role in American government: to decide cases under the rule of law, according to the constitution and laws of our country.Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson was recognized as the frontrunner for this seat because she is a respected judge on one of the nation\u2019s most important courts. Her discussions with US senators, in visits and in the public hearing, will be an ideal forum for serious constitutional debate.Judicial nominees are rightly reluctant to prejudge issues, especially when the nominee is a sitting judge. If Jackson follows this tradition, then senators will have all the more incentive to ask her about the bigger picture: her view of the court\u2019s role in government and its responsibility to faithfully interpret the laws as written.In an era when the Supreme Court is enduring partisan attacks on its legitimacy, and facing dangerous threats to pack the court for partisan purposes, it is crucial for senators \u2013 and all Americans \u2013 to know that the next justice is committed to preserving the rule of law and the court\u2019s indispensable constitutional role.The nomination of\u2013 the first Black woman ever nominated to the US Supreme Court \u2013 is an historic and exciting moment.She is an immensely qualified judge who will bring a new, much-needed and long-overdue perspective to the court. Not only that, Jackson has a demonstrated record of upholding, a critical consideration with the right to abortion facing unprecedented attacks.Jackson\u2019s nomination comes at a pivotal moment for the court. Her confirmation won\u2019t change the balance of the court or the outcome of the looming decision in\u2013 the case directly challenging Roe v. Wade and the constitutional right to abortion. However, we must seize this chance to confirm a justice who will work to protect our most cherished rights and freedoms and help to shape the future of our country in the decades to come.The anti-choice movement and its political allies spent decades working to install their ideologues on our nation\u2019s highest court. The confirmations of Trump\u2019s justices to the Supreme Court cemented a majority that is unmistakably hostile to abortion, and that won\u2019t be easily undone. But confirming justices like Jackson is how we move closer to a future in which all of our families and communities thrive \u2013 a future in which there is equal justice for all of us.With so much on the line, we can\u2019t leave anything on the table in our fight to confirm Jackson to the court.\u200b\u200bWith Russian troops on the march in Ukraine, Americans have not been sitting on the edge of their seats, waiting to see whom President Joe Biden will nominate to the US Supreme Court.Instead, they are glued to their television sets wondering if Russian President Vladimir Putin is crazy enough to trigger World War III in his quest to rebuild the former Soviet Union.Biden\u2019s attempt to change the subject from war, inflation and the economy to the Supreme Court may hurt Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson\u2019s confirmation prospects. The timing of this announcement means the White House has lost an important opportunity to rally the public behind Jackson before Republicans go on the offensive.No doubt, Biden\u2019s nominee is highly qualified for the position. Jackson checks all the right boxes \u2013 she holds a Harvard Law degree, clerked for federal judges and served as a public defender. She now sits as a federal appellate judge on the prestigious DC Circuit Court. She appears to be widely respected in the legal profession, and progressives have already applauded Biden\u2019s decision to nominate her. Republicans, on the other hand, are likely to say that she is too radical for the Supreme Court.Ironically, her biggest obstacle to a swift confirmation is more likely to be Putin than Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell. With Americans more focused on the war in Ukraine than the Supreme Court, Jackson\u2019s confirmation is unlikely to get the attention it deserves. Americans will need an opportunity to get to know Jackson, and the initial publicity surrounding any nominee serves an important educational purpose. Without that public support, Jackson could be more vulnerable to damaging attacks from the GOP.Announcing Jackson\u2019s nomination at this moment, given the current crisis in Ukraine, is a rookie mistake for a president languishing in the polls. As a former chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Biden seems to have forgotten that even in the selection process for Supreme Court nominees, timing is everything."

        "text": "One key to fighting addiction may be exercise, according to a new study.Researchers undertook a review of the existing literature around physical activity and its relationship to substance use, and they found that regular exercise was associated with lowered use in about 75% of the studies investigating that question, according to the analysis.The, looked at 43 studies with more than 3,000 total participants. In addition to a reduction or cessation in substance use, the studies also found improved markers of physical health and decreased depressive symptoms, the study said.\u201cPeople think that during treatment people should only do psychotherapeutic treatments \u2026 but that\u2019s not what we\u2019ve seen in our study,\u201d said lead study author Florence Pich\u00e9, a doctoral student and researcher at Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al in Canada. \u201cIt\u2019s very beneficial to do physical activity in addition to the treatments.\u201dThere are limitations to the findings. The review found that most of the studies the researchers examined had a high risk of bias, meaning more research is needed to confirm their findings, said Dr. Aaron Kandola, research fellow at Medical Research Council Unit for Lifelong Health and Ageing at University College London.The studies were also not directly comparable enough to build a comprehensive and generalizable understanding of the relationship, Kandola said in an email. Kandola was not part of the research.However, the findings were still significant and useful, he added.\u201cSubstance use disorders are a major public health problem lacking low-cost, evidence-based solutions,\u201d he said, adding that substance use disorders are worsening in many high-income countries \u2014 including the United States.Finding more accessible solutions to this disorder is especially important because it often occurs with other mental health problems such as depression and anxiety, which disproportionately affect people with fewer socioeconomic resources and areas with higher deprivation, he said.Physical activity may be a useful and accessible part of a treatment plan for substance use disorder, said Dr. Mark Smith, professor of psychology at Davidson College in North Carolina. Smith was not part of the research.\u201cI think there\u2019s now a sufficient amount of data to indicate that various forms of physical activity and exercise are generally effective at reducing substance use in individuals seeking treatment,\u201d he said.Most people can benefit from engaging in physical activity, Kandola said.One benefit the studies found is improvements in physical health such as cardiovascular endurance or muscle strength, Smith said. And although that may not be the primary goal of the research, he said this finding is important because it shows the physical activity is doing its job to promote physical health.Chronic stress can affect your health. One activity can helpThe research also showed physical activity to be linked with increased self-efficacy, self-esteem and self-confidence, which are known to be protective against substance use, Smith added.And there\u2019s more: Physical activity has been shown to reduce anxiety and depression, which are major risk factors for substance use, Kandola said.Why might a little sweat go such a long way? Exercise produces dramatic changes throughout the brain, Smith said.When you exercise, you are engaging neural pathways that are also affected by substance use. There is a lot of evidence that exercise can help to normalize the changes that occur to those pathways when using substances, Smith added.Although the recent study highlighted the benefits of exercise, it did not find an amount or intensity at which a person needs to exercise to see the benefits, Smith said.The current Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans does recommend that adults get 150 minutes of moderate-intensity physical activity and two days of muscle-strengthening activity.Another question that needs to be asked: Does more exercise mean more benefit?Gardening has taken off. Here's why the popular activity can replace your gym workoutEven without solid answers to those questions, it is a good idea for people with all kinds of health concerns to start, Kandola said.If you don\u2019t have an exercise habit already, start light with light activities like brief walks around the block, he said.\u201cSmall amounts of physical activity are still beneficial and help you to build your fitness by gradually increasing duration and intensity over time,\u201d Kandola said. \u201cThe biggest health benefits are seen in people moving from low to medium levels of physical fitness.\u201dYour exercise should also be fun, Smith said. Liking what you are doing is a great way to reduce substance use.\u201cIf you give individuals an alternative activity that they enjoy, then by default, substance use will decrease. They have something else to do with their time,\u201d Smith said.\u201cNow, this doesn\u2019t necessarily have to be, you know, running for hours on a treadmill. You know, it could be going outside and playing basketball or tennis or pickleball, or whatever your favorite sport is,\u201d he added.\u201cIt may require some trial and error, but finding the right type of physical activity (or activities) for you will increase the chances of sticking with it for longer,\u201d Kandola said in an email. \u201cIt can also be a good way to meet new people or explore new areas.\u201d"

        "text": "Heart disease is the leading killer of men and women worldwide, according to the, but there are ways to significantly reduce your risk.Along with regular exercise and not smoking, a healthy diet is a key way to keep heart disease at bay. But which diet best meets the dietary guidelines of the American Heart Association?Changing your diet could add up to 13 years to your life, study saysIn a new scientific statement, leading experts in nutrition ranked 10 popular diets on their ability to meet the AHA\u2019s evidence-based, published in 2021.The winner?, which was 100% aligned with AHA goals for. DASH stands for Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension; high blood pressure is a major contributor to heart disease and stroke.The pescatarian diet, which allows dairy, eggs, fish and other seafood but no meat or poultry, was 92% aligned with the AHA guidelines. The lacto-ovo-vegetarian diet, which allows dairy and eggs, and variations that include one or the other, were 86% aligned.The award-winning Mediterranean diet was 89% aligned with the AHA dietary recommendations. The popular diet came in third mostly because it recommends a small glass of red wine each day and doesn\u2019t limit salt, said lead author Christopher Gardner, a research professor of medicine at the Stanford Prevention Research Center in Californiawho directs its Nutrition Studies Research Group.\u201cThe American Heart Association says no one should drink alcohol if they haven\u2019t started,\u201d Gardner said. \u201cAnd if they do drink, to do so minimally.\u201dResearch has linked the Mediterranean diet to reduced risk for diabetes, high cholesterol, dementia, memory loss, depression and breast cancer as well as weight loss, stronger bones, a healthier heart and longer life.But all of these diets share so much in common they can really be grouped together as a top \u201ctier\u201d of eating patterns, Gardner said.'Keto-like' diet may be associated with a higher risk of heart disease, according to new research\u201cWe basically were trying to say a diet doesn\u2019t have to be 100 to be good,\u201d he said. \u201cAll of the diets in the top tier are plant-based, and if they are off base a bit aren\u2019t hard to fix. Paleo and keto, however, really can\u2019t be fixed. You\u2019d have to completely overhaul them.\u201dVery low-carb diets, such as Atkins, and various keto diets, such as the well-formulated ketogenic diet, or WFKD, were in the bottom tier of heart-healthy eating patterns, due to their emphasis on red meat, whole dairy and saturated fats, as well as limited fruit and vegetable intake.A vegan diet that incorporated more than 10% fat and low-fat diets such as volumetrics were in the second tier \u2014 both met 78% of the AHA dietary guidelines, according to the statement.Very low-fat diets with less than 10% fat, which applies to some vegan lifestyles (72%), and low-carb diets such as South Beach, Zone and the low-glycemic index (64%) were less aligned and made up the third tier of diets.While people concerned with heart health can and should use the new AHA ranking of the 10 diets, the scientific statement was written for physicians, Gardner said. The goal is to get doctors up to speed, since nutrition is not often prioritized in medical school.\u201cIt\u2019s a cheat sheet for doctors,\u201d Gardner said. \u201cWhen they do ask about diet \u2014 which I don\u2019t think is all that often \u2014 and a patient says, \u2018Oh, yeah, I\u2019m paleo. I\u2019m vegan. I\u2019m keto or I\u2019m DASH,\u2019 I don\u2019t think they really know what that means.\u201dThat\u2019s absolutely true, said preventivecardiologist Dr. Andrew Freeman, director of cardiovascular prevention and wellness at National Jewish Health, a hospital in Denver.\u201cWe surveyed 1,000 cardiologists five or six years ago, and it turns out about 90% of us know almost nothing about nutrition,\u201d said Freeman, who was not involved with developing the AHA statement.Yet patients need their doctors to be discussing nutrition with them during regular checkups, Freeman added.\u201cIf you asked me in my heart of hearts do I think we should have been banging the drum about nutrition for the last 100 years? Yes. So every time we can bang the drum a little more, I\u2019m always in favor,\u201d he said.Now, with a color-coded chart in hand, doctors will be better informed to discuss the foods on those diets and which to emphasize, limit or avoid, Gardner said. Instead of talking about the benefits of specific heart-healthy nutrients and foods, advice should focus on a overall pattern of eating.\u201cWhen it was a single heart-healthy nutrient, you could just inject that nutrient into food and claim it\u2019s healthy food, which it wasn\u2019t,\u201d he said. \u201cOr if there\u2019s a superfood like chia seeds, you could take a really unhealthy food and sprinkle chia seeds on it and say, \u2018Ah, I\u2019m now protected.\u2019 No, it needs to be part of an overall healthy pattern of foods.\u201dTo that point, Gardner stressed that each diet in the rankings was evaluated as it was intended to be eaten, not as people might actually do in real life. The new statement provides information on how doctors might counsel patients who are not eating as optimally as possible, either due to cost, lack of time or other stresses.8 myths about diet, exercise and sleepHowever, fixing those concerns may take more than individual willpower, Freeman said.\u201cIt\u2019s hard to adhere to a diet in a society which allows ultraprocessed comfort foods like bacon-on-a-stick to be the norm, and asking society to change a major tenant of everyday living is going to be very challenging,\u201d he said.\u201cBut I would also tell you the plant-based food movement is the fastest-growing food movement in the country,\u201d he said. \u201cSo there\u2019s hope.\u201d"

        "text": "Cruising at a depth of 8,336 meters (over 27,000 feet) just above the seabed, a young snailfish has become the deepest fish ever filmed by scientists during a probe into the abyss of the northern Pacific Ocean.Scientists from University of Western Australia and Tokyo University of Marine Science and Technology released footage of the snailfish on Sunday filmed last September by sea robots in deep trenches off Japan.Along with the filming the deepest snailfish, the scientists physically caught two other specimens at 8,022 meters and set another record for the deepest catch.Previously, the deepest snailfish ever spotted was at 7,703 meters in 2008, while scientists had never been able to collect fish from anywhere below 8,000 meters.\u201cWhat is significant is that it shows how far a particular type of fish will descend in the ocean,\u201d said marine biologist Alan Jamieson, founder of the Minderoo-UWA Deep Sea Research Centre, who led the expedition.Scientists are filming in the trenches off Japan as part of a 10-year study into the deepest fish populations in the world. Snailfish are members of Liparidae family, and while most snailfish live in shallow water, others survive at some of the greatest depths ever recorded, Jamieson said.During the two-month survey last year, three \u201clanders\u201d \u2013 automatic sea robots fitted with high-resolution cameras \u2013 were dropped into three trenches \u2013 the Japan, Izu-Ogasawara and Ryukyu trenches \u2013 at varying depths.In the Izu-Ogasawara trench, footage showed the deepest snailfish hovering calmly alongside other crustaceans on the seabed.Jamieson classified the fish as a juvenile and said younger deep sea snailfish often stay as deep as possible to avoid being eaten by bigger predators that swim at shallower depths.Another clip shot at between 7,500 and 8,200 meters in the same trench showed a colony of fish and crustaceans munching at bait tied to an undersea robot.Images of the two captured snailfish \u2013 identified as\u2013 provide a rare glimpse of the unique features that help the deep sea species survive the extreme environment.They have tiny eyes, a translucent body, and their lack of swim bladder, which helps other fish float, works to their advantage, Jamieson said.The professor said the Pacific Ocean is particularly conducive to vibrant activity due to its warm southern current, which encourages sea creatures to go deeper, while its abundant marine life provides a good source of food for bottom feeders.Scientists would like to know more about creatures living at extreme depths, but cost is the constraint, Jamieson said, adding that each lander alone costs them $200,000 to assemble and operate.\u201cThe challenges are that technology has been expensive and scientists don\u2019t have a lot of money,\u201d he said."

        "text": "You had a little too much to drink last night, and now you\u2019re nursing that dreaded morning aftermath \u2014 a hangover.Global study finds surprising results for alcohol consumptionWhat seemed like great fun at the time is now causing your hands to shake, your head to pound and your heart to race, not to mention other unpleasant symptoms such as dizziness, nausea, vomiting, light sensitivity and excruciating thirst.Why are you suffering? Because the liquor that smoothly passed your lips is now wreaking havoc in your body, causing dehydration, stomach distress and inflammation. These ailments peak about the time all the alcohol leaves your body.There is no scientifically proven way to cure a hangover, but experts say you can prevent one \u2014 or at least keep that morning-after misery to a minimum. Here\u2019s how.Forget a late-night meal after a night of drinking \u2014 that\u2019s much too late, experts say. Instead, eat before your first drink and keep noshing as the night goes on.\u201cFood in the stomach slows gastric emptying and can reduce hangover symptoms,\u201d said Dr. Robert Swift, a professor of psychiatry and human behaviorat Brown University\u2019s Warren Alpert Medical School in Providence, Rhode Island.Why does food help? Because most alcohol isn\u2019t absorbed by an empty stomach but via the intestinal tract just below it, Swift said.\u201cIf somebody does shots on an empty stomach, for example, all that pure alcohol is not diluted by the stomach and is passed to the intestine very quickly,\u201d said Swift, who has studied alcohol abuse since the 1990s.\u201cIf the stomach contains food, however, there are gastric juices and enzymes that mix the food and the alcohol, and only small amounts of food are passed into the intestine,\u201d he said. \u201cNow the alcohol is diluted in the stomach,and only a small quantity of alcohol is absorbed at any time.\u201dThe same principle applies to water and other nonalcoholic beverages, Swift said. \u201cIf alcohol is mixed with fluid, it\u2019s diluted, so when it goes into your intestines,it\u2019s not as irritating. You\u2019re less likely to have inflamed intestines or an inflamed stomach lining.\u201dThere\u2019s another benefit to downing water between drinks, said Dr. John Brick, former chief of research at theCenter of Alcohol Studies, Education and Training Division at Rutgers University in New Jersey.\u201cThe primary cause of hangovers is dehydration and the loss of fluids, along with vitamins and minerals,\u201d said Brick, who authored \u201cThe Doctor\u2019s Hangover Handbook\u201d and published scientific papers on the biobehavioral effects of alcohol and other drugs.Pandemic fueled alcohol abuse, especially among women, but there are treatment optionsDowning just 3\u00bd alcoholic drinks can result in the loss of up to a quart of water over several hours, Brick added. \u201cThat\u2019s a good amount of water that has to be replenished.\u201dDehydration from alcohol may affect a woman even more, and she is more likely to suffer a hangover, even if she drinks less than a man, Swift said. That\u2019s because a man has a higher percentage of body water than a woman of the same height and weight, so the same amount of alcohol will be more diluted in a man, he said.\u201cThe woman will have a higher concentration of blood alcohol because her body contains less water to dilute it,\u201d he said. \u201cWomen are much more susceptible to the deleterious effects of alcohol (and they)get more intoxicated and develop alcohol liver disease sooner in life than men do.\u201dThe alcohol we drink, called ethyl alcohol or ethanol, is the byproduct of fermenting carbohydrates and starches, usually some sort of grain, grape or berry. We use byproducts of fermentation in other ways: Ethanol is added to the gasoline in our cars, and methyl alcohol or methanol \u2014 a toxic substance \u2014 is used as a solvent, pesticide and alternative fuel source. Also called wood alcohol, methyl alcohol made by bootleggers.Stress can be good for you, and here's whyThat\u2019s not all \u2014 the list of byproducts or chemicals added by manufacturers for flavor and taste can read like a list of supplies at an industrial warehouse: ethyl formate, ethyl acetate, n-propanol, isobutanol, n-butanol, isopentanol and isoamyl alcohols. While these congeners, as they are called, are added in small, nontoxic amounts, some people are overly sensitive to their effects.Overall, dark-colored beer and spirits tend to contain more congenersand thus may be more likely to cause hangovers, experts say. Ainvestigated the intensity of hangovers in people who drank the darker-colored liquor bourbon versus clear vodka.\u201cCongeners in bourbon \u2026 significantly increased hangover intensity, which is not too surprising since bourbon has about 37 times the amount of congeners as vodka,\u201d Brick said.Want to live longer? Be an optimist, study saysChemical preservatives called sulfites, known to cause, are also a natural byproduct of fermentation insmall quantities. However, many manufacturers of beer and wine add sulfites to their products to extend shelf life. (Sulfites are also added to soda, cereals, sweeteners, canned and ultraprocessed foods, medications and more.)Sweet and white winestend to have more sulfites than red, but red wines contain more tannins, which are bitter or astringent compounds found in the skin and seeds of grapes. Like sulfites, tannins can trigger allergic reactions in people who are sensitive.As a result, limitingyour drinking to light beers, clear liquors and white wine might help keep hangovers at bay.In the end, however, experts say there is only one true preventive \u2014 or cure \u2014 for a hangover: Don\u2019t drink.\u201cThere\u2019s no simple cure because there are so many complex factors that are producing the multiple symptoms of a hangover,\u201d Swift said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s why the only real cure for a hangover is to not drink alcohol or drink such a low amount of alcohol that it won\u2019t trigger a hangover.\u201dCorrection: A previous version of this story misstated the process through which alcohol is absorbed in the body."

Adam was not involved in the new study.Toxic chemicals may be in fast food wrappers and take-out containers, report says\u201cAs adults, around the world, we take extra precautions when it comes to our children. We buckle them into car seats, make sure they wear helmets,\u201d Adam said. \u201cWhen it comes to packaged foods, the food industry is doing the opposite: actually promoting less healthy foods to the most vulnerable members of society.\u201dAnd the problem might be even worse than the study shows. Mulligan noted that the study looked only at products in one point in time.\u201cWe are likely underestimating just how much marketing children are exposed to on food packages in real time \u2014 and packaging is just one of the ways that food companies target children with food marketing,\u201d she said.A large body of research shows that children are marketed these products from all sides, whether that be on television or social media, at sports practice or at community centers \u2014 even at school, she said.\u201cThis is important for readers to understand, because seeing all of this marketing is impacting how children eat, and the poor dietary habits that kids are developing will carry forward throughout their lives and impact their health in the long term,\u201d Mulligan said.The study was conducted in Canada, but the problem is global, Mulligan said.And governments will need to step in to regulate companies\u2019 ability to target children directly when marketing products that can harm their health, she added.\u201cThese policies need to be strong and comprehensive so that they effectively protect children from these harmful marketing practices in all the places that kids live, eat and play,\u201d Mulligan said.\u201cIt\u2019s clear that product packages are used by companies to market their products to children. This is why groups like Heart and Stroke are calling for the inclusion of all types of marketing, not just television and digital media, in the regulations planned for Canada,\u201d said Manuel Arango, director of health policy and advocacy with the Heart and Stroke Foundation of Canada.But in the meantime, there are ways to make changes at home, starting with becoming more aware of the ways children are being exposed to advertisements for products that could be harmful to them, she said.An easy way to start is by cooking more at home, Adam said.\u201cFor those meals, you control the amount of fat, sugar and salt in your children\u2019s food,\u201d she added.Cooking and eating at home is also shown to improve mental and emotional health and academic performance, Adam said.Mulligan recommends talking to kids about how companies use marketing and how it might influence their choices.\u201cThis can also be a great opportunity to get children involved in family grocery shopping and help them learn about how to choose, make and eat healthy, delicious foods,\u201d she said."

The research,on Wednesday, revealed intriguing details about its ancient wearer and is the first time scientists have successfully isolated ancient human DNA from a Stone Age artifact.Excavated from Denisova Cave in southern Siberia, the pendant was worn by a woman who lived between 19,000 and 25,000 years ago, according to the analysis of human genetic material preserved in the pendant. She belonged to a group known as Ancient North Eurasians, which have a genetic connection toThe new method will hopefully allow scientists to learn about the sex and genetic ancestry of the Stone Age makers, wearers and users of an array of bone tools and ornaments unearthed from digs around the world.\u201cIt\u2019s amazing. It means that we\u2019ll be able to answer very simple questions such as what tasks males and females were doing at that point time,\u201d said study coauthor Marie Soressi, a professor and chair of human origins at Faculty of Archaeology of Leiden University in the Netherlands. \u201cWe actually will have a direct line of evidence to tell us.\u201dAncient DNA reveals secrets of empire that pushed China to build its Great WallThe technique may also, for example, be able reveal whether a tool was used by a Neanderthal or our own Homo sapiens ancestors, she added.Human DNA was likely preserved in the deer bone pendant because it is porous and therefore more likely to retain genetic material present in skin cells, sweat and other body fluids.Typically, researchers would use a small drill to extract bone powder from an artifact or bone. Lead study author Elena Essel, a molecular biologist at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology, in Leipzig, Germany, described the newly developed technique as a \u201claboratory washing machine without the movement.\u201dThe pendant was submerged in a sodium phosphate buffer solution while gradually increasing the temperature. This allowed the DNA to be released into the solution, where it was isolated, purified and sequenced using existing tools.\u201cIf we want to stay in this image of the washing machine, it\u2019s the wash water that was exciting for us,\u201d Essel explained.While bone tools and artifacts are rarer than stone ones, they are still much more common in the archaeological record than humans remains, opening up new avenues for research.Oldest DNA sheds light on a 2 million-year-old ecosystem that has no modern parallelThe pendant study, however, is essentially a proof of concept, and it\u2019s not clear how easy it will be to extract ancient human DNA from other bone ornaments and tools.The technique, at least as it stands, only worked on freshly excavated material and where archaeologists had taken steps to ensure that the artifact is \u201cclean\u201d \u2014 i.e. not contaminated with modern human DNA \u2014 by wearing gloves and a mask and making sure the object was sealed in a bag immediately after being unearthed.The technique didn\u2019t identify ancient DNA when applied to a set of  bone tools from the French cave Quin\u00e7ay excavated back in the 1970s to 1990s \u2014 when nobody had any idea that genetic material could be preserved for so long.Nor was it possible to extract ancient DNA from three freshly excavated tooth pendants from Bacho Kiro Cave in Bulgaria, home to some of the earliest known modern humans in Europe, according to the study.\u201cRight now, it\u2019s like this one sample. I would be really interested in learning more about how often we can can extract ancient human DNA and if it\u2019s like a specific type of artifact that is more promising or if it works equally well for (bone) tools,\u201d Essel said.It\u2019s not known why the deer tooth pendant contained such a large amount of the ancient woman\u2019s DNA (about the same amount as a human tooth) \u2014 perhaps it was well-loved and worn close to the skin for an exceptionally long period of time, Essel said.\u201cHow we think it works is that the longer there was close body contact, the higher the chances that a lot of DNA is in the material \u2026 but we have no idea if we\u2019re talking about days or months or years or decades.\u201d"

And what else are you putting on your plate?\u201d she said. \u201cYou don\u2019t need that much to gain the positives from it.\u201dWhich cheese is healthiest? The answer depends on your specific body and its nutritional needs, but here are some pointers from experts.Both Castro Mortillaro and Emily Martorano, a registered dietitian with NYU Langone\u2019s weight management, agree on ricotta being a winner in the healthfulness department.The name of the cheese translates to \u201ccooked-again,\u201d and Castro Mortillaro explained that authentic ricotta is produced by treating the whey that is leftover after milk (such as sheep\u2019s milk) is coagulated to produce cheese (such as pecorino).Ricotta has a high concentration of whey protein, which is easily absorbed by the body.\u201cWhey protein is one of the most absorbable forms of protein and it contains a very wide range of amino acids,\u201d Martorano said. \u201cSo this is the best bet for someone who\u2019s looking to build muscle, build strength while also losing fat and weight.\u201dCastro Mortillaro also pointed to ricotta\u2019s potential sustainability benefits, as it puts to use the leftover byproducts of cheesemaking.\u201cThat\u2019s very Tuscan,\u201d she added.Castro Mortillaro believes harder cheeses such as Parmigiano, pecorino or gouda are also among the healthiest options, when consumed in moderation.Because they contain less water and are more concentrated, \u201chard cheeses are going to be higher in calcium, and you\u2019re probably going to be satiated with smaller amounts, so you tend to not to over-consume,\u201d she said.However, because they are more concentrated, harder cheeses also might have a higher sodium content than softer ones.\u201cIf you\u2019re hypertensive, or you really need to control your sodium intake, or maybe you have renal issues, then probably going for a softer cheese would be better,\u201d Castro Mortillaro said.If you\u2019re watching your weight, protein is the name of the game. It keeps you full longer, and helps you build muscle.Cheeses that are rich in protein and lower in fat are great options for folks looking to manage their weight, Martorano said.Europeans were enjoying blue cheese and beer 2,700 years ago, ancient poop showsA good way to determine which cheeses fall in this category is to consider a 1:10 ratio of protein to calories, according to Martorano.\u201cFor every 100 calories, there should be at least 10 grams of protein \u2013 that will tell you if it\u2019s a good source of protein and in turn a healthier cheese,\u201d she explained.Some cheeses that she recommended based on this are light Swiss cheese, light cheddar cheese and ricotta.If possible, steer clear of the highly processed stuff, including cheese in a can, individually wrapped slices and those blocks that don\u2019t even need to be refrigerated.\u201cSqueezable cheese, American cheese, even cream cheese, provide minimal protein for a much higher fat and sodium content,\u201d Martorano said.Some of the processed cheese varietals are not even technicallyas \u201ccheeses\u201d by the US Food and Drug Administration, but as \u201cpasteurized process cheese foods\u201d or \u201cpasteurized process cheese products,\u201d depending on the percentage of actual cheese they contain along with other ingredients.\u201cFresh is always better,\u201d according to Martorano.Dietary trends come and go, and Castro Mortillaro remembers the \u201cfat-free phase\u201d in the 1990s and early 2000s.\u201cWe had fat-free cheese and fat-free mayonnaise, and all this other kind of stuff, and it was just highly processed,\u201d she said.Castro Mortillaro thinks that unless your specific goal is to lose weight, full-fat cheese should have a place in your diet.\u201cIt\u2019s better to have a smaller amount of something that is just more wholesome, if you\u2019re in that neutral category, and enjoy it,\u201d she said.Some cheeses can also be a good source of probiotics, according to Martorano, who pointed to feta, goat cheese and cheese made from raw or unpasteurized milk as great options.The artisanal cheese varieties, however, can cost a pretty penny.\u201cNot everyone can afford to buy the most fancy cheese. When it comes to packaged cheeses, they\u2019re all fine in moderation,\u201d Martorano said.It\u2019s best to think of cheese as a flavoring agent rather than as a meal in itself, according to both Martorano and Castro Mortillaro.\u201cInstead of using cheese as the main source of nutrients, it really is a side,\u201d Martorano told CNN.\u201cIf we\u2019re pairing that cheese with something else \u2013 a vegetable, a whole grain \u2013 that\u2019s what\u2019s going to make it more of a satisfying, filling meal,\u201d she explained.Ricotta for breakfast, paired with some oatmeal and fruit, could be a healthy start to the day, Martorano suggested.An afternoon snack with Swiss cheese and vegetables, or a whole grain cracker, would also be a good idea, she said.Ultimately, unless there are specific concerns you need to keep in mind, the healthiest cheese is your favorite one, enjoyed sparingly as the delicious occasional treat that it should be.\u201cAt the end of the day, if there\u2019s a cheese that someone likes and they want to have it in moderation, it\u2019s better to have the one that you like. So always pick the one you enjoy the most,\u201d Martorano said."

A native of Baltimore, Maryland, he\u2019s completed one prior spaceflight, a 165-day trip to the International Space Station that had launched aboard a Russian Soyuz rocket in 2014. Most recently, Wiseman served as chief of the astronaut office before stepping down in November 2022, making him eligible for a flight assignment.Wiseman will serve as commander of the Artemis II mission.Hansen, 47, is a fighter pilot who was selected by the Canadian Space Agency for astronaut training in 2009. From London, Ontario, Hansen is one of only four active Canadian astronauts, and he recently became the first Canadian to be put in charge of training for a new class of NASA astronauts.He will be the first Canadian ever to travel to deep space.is a 46-year-old naval aviator who returned to Earth from his first spaceflight in 2021 afterand spending nearly six months aboard the International Space Station.\u201cIt\u2019s so much more than the four names that have been announced,\u201d Glover said during the Monday announcement at NASA Johnson Space Center in Houston. \u201cWe need to celebrate this moment in human history. \u2026 It is the next step in the journey that will get humanity to Mars.\u201dGlover, born in Pomona, California, served in several military squadrons in the United States and Japan in the 2000s, and he completed test pilot training with the US Air Force. When he was selected for the NASA astronaut corps in 2013, he was working in the US Senate as a legislative fellow. All told, Glover logged 3,000 flight hours in more than 40 aircraft, over 400 carrier arrested landings and 24 combat missions.Glover\u2019s first mission to space was as part of the SpaceX Crew-1 team, which launched to the International Space Station in November 2020 for a six-month stay on the orbiting laboratory., 44, is a veteran of six spacewalks \u2014 including the. She holds the record for the longest single spaceflight by a woman, with a total of 328 days in space. Koch is also an an electrical engineer who helped develop scientific instruments for multiple NASA mission. Koch, a native of Grand Rapids, Michigan, also spent a year at the South Pole, an arduous stay that could well prepare her for the intensity of a moon mission.The Artemis II mission will build on Artemis I, anthat sent NASA\u2019s Orion capsule on a 1.4 million-mile voyage to lap the moon that concluded in December. The space agency deemed that mission a success and is still working to review all the data collected.If all goes to plan, Artemis II will take off around November 2024. The crew members, strapped inside the Orion spacecraft, will launch atop a NASA-developed Space Launch System rocket from NASA\u2019s Kennedy Space Center in Florida.The journey is expected to last about 10 days and will send the crew out beyond the moon, potentially further than any human has traveled in history, though the exact distance is yet to be determined.The \u201cexact distance beyond the Moon will depend on the day of liftoff and the relative distance of the Moon from the Earth at the time of the mission,\u201d NASA spokesperson Kathryn Hambleton said via email.After circling the moon, the spacecraft will return to Earth for a splashdown landing in the Pacific Ocean.Artemis II is expected to pave the way for the Artemis III mission later this decade, which NASA has vowed will put the first woman and person of color on the lunar surface. It will also mark the first time humans have touched down on the moon since the Apollo program ended in 1972.The Artemis III mission is expected to take off later this decade. But much of the technology the mission will require, includingfor walking on the moon and ato ferry the astronauts to the moon\u2019s surface, is still in development.NASA is targeting afor Artemis III, though the space agency\u2019s inspector general has already said delays will likely push the mission to.The space agency has been seeking to return people to the moon for more than a decade.

        "name": "How promising are new drugs to treat obesity and who should \u2014 and shouldn\u2019t \u2014 use them? Our medical analyst explains",
        "link": "https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/05/health/obesity-diabetes-medication-wellness/index.html",
        "text": "Thelast week that a medication developed to treat diabetes, tirzepatide, also had a substantial effect on reducing weight.Among the more than 900 adults with obesity and diabetes in a study, tirzepatide not only controlled their blood sugar but also helped those on the higher dose lose an average of 34 pounds, which was nearly 16% of their starting weight, according to a company news release. The participants took the drug for a year and five months.Novo Nordisk limits Wegovy doses for new patients as demand outpaces supplyEli Lilly plans to file for approval by the US Food and Drug Administration to market tirzepatide for treating obesity.Another pharmaceutical company, Novo Nordisk, manufactures the medication semaglutide, which the FDA has already approved to treat diabetes under the brand name Ozempic and to treat obesity under the brand name Wegovy. Celebrities, and its widespread use has triggered medication shortages.How exactly do semaglutide and tirzepatide work? How promising are they to treat obesity? What are the side effects? Who is eligible? What if someone wants to lose a few pounds for a wedding or event \u2014 should they take them?To help us with these questions, I spoke with CNN Medical Analyst Dr. Leana Wen. Wen is an emergency physician and professor of health policy and management at the George Washington University Milken Institute School of Public Health. She previously was Baltimore\u2019s health commissioner.Both of these injection medications were initially developed to treat type 2 diabetes. In the process of doing clinical trials, research also found that they have a substantial effect on weight loss.Ozempic prescriptions can be easy to get online. Its popularity for weight loss is hurting those who need it mostSemaglutide mimics a digestive hormone called glucagon-like protein-1, or GLP-1, that\u2019s released by intestines when we eat. This hormone promotes insulin production, which encourages cells to take up glucose and therefore to reduce blood glucose levels. GLP-1 also slows gastric emptying and prolongs the sensation of feeling full. In addition, it suppresses appetite, resulting in people wanting to eat less and inducing weight loss.Tirzepatide mimics GLP-1 as well as another hormone released by the gut to stimulate insulin production called glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP). While GIP isn\u2019t as well studied as GLP-1, it appears to have a similar effect to it. Tirzepatide has this dual effect on GLP-1 and GIP, while semaglutide targets just GLP-1. It\u2019s important to note that we do not have study results comparing these two medications side by side.Of the two medications, semaglutide is the one that\u2019s better studied. A 2022 study, published in, found that study participants\u2019 mean weight loss after taking it for three months was 6.7 kilograms (14.8 pounds), or 5.9% body weight reduction. After six months, it was 12.3 kilograms (27.1 pounds), or 10.9%.Another study, published in, found a mean loss of body weight of 14.9% from baseline to more than a year later in the semaglutide group, compared with 2.4% in the placebo group.According to, it appears that the company achieved a very high rate of weight loss as well. For those taking the higher dose of tirzepatide, patients lost an average of 15.6 kilograms (34.4 pounds), which was equivalent to a 15.7% body weight reduction, at over a year of treatment. These results are not yet published in a peer-reviewed publication, but if they hold up, these would be really excellent results as well.I think the key to emphasize here is that obesity is a chronic medical condition that increases the risk of developing many other diseases, including heart disease, diabetes, high cholesterol and many forms of cancers. Patients with obesity also experience higher rates of sleep apnea, arthritis, back pain and depression, and they are at higher risk for early mortality. It is really important to treat obesity as the disease that it is \u2014 and having effective medications to do so is crucial.Virtually all medications and therapies have side effects. These are no different.The most common side effects are gastrointestinal discomforts, such as nausea, diarrhea, vomiting and constipation. The medications have been associated in rare cases with pancreatitis and gallbladder problems, and some patients may experience low blood sugars while taking them. Some animal studies have linked them to thyroid tumors \u2014 and although this has not been seen in humans, patients are advised against using either of these medications if they or their family members have had a type of thyroid cancer known as.WeightWatchers jumps into the prescription weight loss drug businessIn addition, these are injection medications. As such, there could also be pain, swelling and redness at the injection site. And because these medications are relatively new, long-term effects are not known, and it is also not known as to how long people should continue taking them.Anecdotally, many patients have had their weight rebound back soon after stopping.Semaglutide is marketed under the brand name of Ozempic for treatment of diabetes and Wegovy for treatment of obesity. For Ozempic, it is approved only to treat type 2 diabetes. For Wegovy, patients are eligible if they have a body mass index, or BMI, at or over 27. They are to use it together with lifestyle modifications, including increased physical activity and improved diet.Tirzepatide, also known as brand name Mounjaro, is only approved by the FDA to treat type 2 diabetes. However, like other prescription medications, it can be prescribed for what\u2019s called off-label use by physicians. Some physicians prescribe Mounjaro and Ozempic for treatment of obesity, even though (they are) not approved by the FDA for this purpose.Well, you just described the type of person who should not take these medications. Type 2 diabetes and obesity are serious medical conditions. These medications should be reserved for individuals with these conditions.As the market for new weight loss drugs soars, people with diabetes pay the priceThese are not medications to be taken by nondiabetic people who do not have obesity. In addition, individuals who are considered overweight or to have obesity based on BMI may not need these medications. In general, just like for other chronic conditions of hypertension and diabetes, people should try lifestyle modifications first. Only if these modifications do not work should medications be considered in consultation with your doctor, and even then, the lifestyle changes should continue.I want to emphasize that these are not medications to be used for vanity purposes. Someone who is trying to lose a few pounds for a wedding or event should not take them for several reasons. First, it\u2019s very likely that once that person stops taking the medication, the weight will come right back. Second, there are better ways to lose weight, and, more importantly, to maintain good health. Third, this is not what the medication is intended for. Given the medication shortages that have occurred, a person taking it for this kind of short-term use could be taking it away from patients who really need it for their medical conditions."

        "text": "Drug overdose deaths in the US rose to record levels during the Covid-19 pandemic, and a newfrom the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention details the deadly rise of fentanyl.Typically, the CDC reports overdose data by broader drug categories. Fentanyl, for example, is grouped with other synthetic opioids like tramadol and nitazenes. But for Wednesday\u2019s report, researchers took a closer look at the specific drugs that are included on death certificates for people who died of overdoses, highlighting demographic differences.Nearly 70,000 people in the US died of drug overdoses that involved fentanyl in 2021, almost a four-fold increase over five years. By 2021, about two-thirds of all overdose deaths involved the potent synthetic opioid, according to the report. Multiple drugs can be reported on one death certificate, and fentanyl is often found along with others, according to the CDC.Biden administration declares fentanyl laced with xylazine 'an emerging threat' in the USSpecific information about the drugs involved in deadly overdoses is critical to assess the effects of drug policy and to guide treatment programs, experts say.\u201cWe need to know exactly what people are dying from so we know what services they need to stay alive,\u201d said Caleb Banta-Green, a research professor at the University of Washington School of Medicine\u2019s Addictions, Drug & Alcohol Institute who was not involved in the new report.Understanding different drug sources \u2013 such as prescription tramadol vs. illicit fentanyl \u2013 and modes of ingestion are essential factors, he said. They can give additional information about who is using and the relative addiction and overdose potential.Pharmaceutical fentanyl is a synthetic opioid intended to help patients, such as those with cancer, manage severe pain. It is 50 to 100 times more potent than morphine and typically prescribed in the form of skin patches or lozenges. But most recent cases of fentanyl-related harm, overdose and death in the United States are linked to illegally made fentanyl, according to the CDC.Fentanyl is significantly more likely to be involved in a deadly overdose than other common drugs, according to the new CDC report.In 2021, fentanyl was involved in about 22 deaths for every 100,000 people \u2013 more than twice as many as the age-adjusted death rate from overdoses involving methamphetamine or cocaine, and more than seven times higher than those involving heroin.New approach gets newborns with opioid withdrawal out of the hospital sooner and with less medicationFentanyl was the most common drug involved in fatal overdoses across age groups, race and ethnicity groups and genders in 2021.For people younger than 25 and older than 65, the rate was not significantly different than it was for other drugs. But it was exceptionally high among ages 25 to 44.The rate of overdose deaths involving fentanyl was highest in the Northeast. In the Northwest, however, overdose deaths involving methamphetamine were similar to those involving fentanyl.This tracks with long-term trends in the US, where drug use has followed distinct patterns in the West and the East, said Dr. Nora Volkow, director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse.As with fentanyl, rates of overdose deaths involving methamphetamine increased significantly between 2016 and 2021, according to the CDC report.Overdose deaths from cocaine also jumped between 2016 and 2021, while deaths involving heroin and oxycodone decreased, according to the CDC report.every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.Overall, the findings in the report aren\u2019t particularly surprising, Volkow said. Fentanyl is overwhelmingly mentioned in reports from emergency rooms, treatment programs and law enforcement.\u201cIt\u2019s just so widespread,\u201d she said.But the quantitative data corroborates anecdotal reports and offers a path forward.\u201cThese are some very clear statistics that I found very, very useful,\u201d Volkow said. \u201cUnderstanding these differences is crucial, because then you can target intervention to address the risk.\u201d"

A lot of them can \u201cdo more harm than good,\u201d according to registered dietitian Angie Asche, owner ofand author of \u201c.\u201d Asche said cleanses can be dehydrating and contain herbal supplements with potentially negative side effects and contraindications with certain medications. What\u2019s more, some of these regimens don\u2019t deliver on their promise, according to the. \u201cMost are missing key nutrients that are necessary for your body to naturally detoxify,\u201d she explained.Live longer with these dishes from 'blue zones' in AmericaFiber, found in plant foods, is the key to safe and efficient cleansing, according to Asche. She advises eating five to nine fruits and vegetables daily for bowel regularity and weight management. \u201cNot only do plant foods like nuts, seeds, legumes, whole grains, fruit and vegetables contain antioxidants,\u201d Asche said, \u201cbut the more variety of plants we have in our diets, the better for the diversity of our.\u201dWith your focus on eating more real, whole foods rich in fiber, Asche also recommends limitingsuch as cookies, candy, crackers, baked goods and fried foods. These foods are full of saturated fat, sodium, sugar and preservatives while being devoid of nutritional value.Hydration can significantly impact your physical health, study findsHow much water you drink affects all the functions of your body \u2014 including your mental performance; a body water loss of just. To promote, Asche advises drinking at least half your body weight in ounces daily but said the amount can vary depending on a person\u2019s activity level.Asche said that most fluids, including tea, coffee and carbonated water, can count toward your water intake, but she points out that alcohol does not \u2014 and should be limited. \u201cIn large amounts, alcohol can overwhelm the gut, promoting intestinal inflammation and increasing harmful bacteria \u2026 (which) can lead to a wide range of health problems,\u201d she said.Screens that look at your ability to do functional movements, such as squatting and lunging, are a great way to proactively prevent injury, according to physical therapist Gray Cook, a cofounder of.These simple daily activities can help ward off back pain\u201cSigns of weakness, tightness and balance problems can be early indicators of arthritis and posture issues as well as increased injury risk for athletes and fall risk for the elderly,\u201d Cook said.You can get the assistance of a physical therapist or qualified trainer to perform a movement assessment, butshowed that self-movement assessment (using an appby Cook) is valid and reliable for identifying musculoskeletal risk factors.Strengthen your core with exercises you can do at home using only a paper plateWhether working with professional athletes or doing my own workouts, I ensure that I cover all primary functional movements in all planes of motion in every training session. Executing that kind of total-body workout sounds more complicated than it is. It\u2019s simply about practicing and strengthening your ability to perform your body\u2019s basic movement functions: squatting, hinging, pushing, pulling, rotating and stabilizing your core.And, just like the multidirectional movement of everyday life, it helps to exercise in all three planes of motion: sagittal (forward/backward), frontal (side to side) and transverse (rotating). You can easily practice these movements withor.The key to exercise\u2019s effectiveness is consistency. With as little as 11 minutes of exercise per day, you can enjoy numerous health benefits \u2014 including. Walking outside is a great way to get in those 11 minutes daily, and because of the alternating and reciprocal nature of gait, it offers the opportunity to tune into your body and self-assess by noticing if there are.in how you think, feel and move.

        "link": "https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/05/health/covid-changes-predictions/index.html",
        "text": "In March, the White House reached out to about a dozen Covid-19 experts who are closely following the evolution of the coronavirus to ask a simple question: What did they think were the chances of the world seeing a highly mutated variant, akin to Omicron, within the next two years?The experts came up with a surprisingly narrow range of probabilities, between 5% and 30%, according to Dr. Eric Topol, founder and director of the Scripps Research Translational Institute. He said the data was shared with him on the phone after he gave his own estimate of 15% to 20%.WHO says Covid-19 is no longer a global health emergencyMost believed that the odds would be somewhere in the neighborhood of 10% to 20%.Dr. Dan Barouch, director of the Center for Virology and Vaccine Research at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston, told CNN that he was one of those experts.He was approached by Dr. Ashish Jha, the Covid-19 response coordinator for the White House, for \u201cjust a informal phone conversation about my thoughts about immunity and variants and the chance of new variants emerging. It was not an official consultation meeting, as far as I could tell. It really was more of just a informal discussion amongst colleagues, I think,\u201d Barouch said.\u201cI said that there is a chance that there will be a new variant that is a fundamental shift, kind of like Delta to Omicron was. I thought that that was\u2013it was not an infinitesimal chance, but it also is not an 80% chance,\u201d he said. Jha pressed him to give a number, and Barouch told him, \u201cmy gut feeling is that it\u2019ll be in the 20% range.\u201dBarouch said he was pleasantly surprised to find out that most of the other experts have put the chances around there, too.One, Dr. Trevor Bedford, a computational biologist at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center, did some very simple modeling based on the fact that there\u2019s been one Omicron-level shift in the virus in about 3\u00bd years of transmission. That happened in November 2021, when the Omicron variant was first detected in the US.Covid-19 was the fourth leading cause of death in 2022, CDC data showsCarrying that forward in time, he estimated that the risk of another such event within the next two years was higher, about 40% between now and May 4, 2025, he told CNN.\u201c40% feels intuitively high. The main reason that 40% number could be off is if in today\u2019s world Omicron-like events are now much less likely than in the world of 2020-2021. However, I don\u2019t see an obvious reason for this to be the case,\u201d Bedford wrote in an email, noting that scientists are tracking highly mutated cryptic lineages in people who have been infected for long periods of time.The calls to experts came as the Biden administration prepared for the end of the public health emergency for Covid-19, which is set for Thursday.The White House\u2019s effort to collect these expert estimates was first reported Friday by the Washington Post.The end of the US emergency will come with a host of changes to how the government tracks the pandemic, with data collection becoming less frequent in most cases and less granular.  Labs will no longer have to submit testing data to the government.  Reporting of cases by states will also become discretionary.The way the US government tracks Covid-19 is about to changeTopol said he thinks the dismantling of data systems is a mistake, given the consensus that another highly disruptive variant could be on the way within a few years.\u201cI wish there wouldn\u2019t be as much letdown, because this is on the horizon, is a real risk,\u201d he said.Topol said he\u2019s also concerned by recent congressional efforts to reclaim funds that have been dedicated to coronavirus response, which some estimate could be as much as $50 billion.About $5 billion of that unspent money has been allocated to developing the next generation of Covid-19 vaccines, which Topol says are needed now more than ever to defend against an Omicron-level event.\u201cThis is why it\u2019s so essential we get these next-generation vaccines, the nasal vaccines, the pan-coronavirus universal vaccines, the monoclonal antibodies that work against all versions of this virus,\u201d Topol said.every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.CNN has reached out to the White House for comment. An official said efforts to respond to Covid-19 will continue but in a different form after the public health emergency ends.\u201cAs we transition out of the emergency phase of Covid, the White House is standing up the Office of Pandemic Preparedness Response (OPPR) as required by law,\u201d the official said.\u201cOPPR will work with HHS and other agencies on continued Covid response work \u2013 including prep for future surges, as well as be the lead [Executive Office of the President] division for future pandemic preparedness.\u201d"

        "text": "Novo Nordisk, maker of the weight-loss drug Wegovy, said it would limit supply of starter doses as demand outpaces the company\u2019s manufacturing capacity.The supply interruptions aren\u2019t expected to affect higher doses of the medicine for people who already take the drug, the company said in a statement posted Thursday on its. Novo Nordisk said it anticipates that many people will have trouble filling prescriptions at the lower initial doses through September.As the market for new weight loss drugs soars, people with diabetes pay the priceThe US Food and Drug Administration approved Wegovy for chronic weight management for people with a body mass index of 30 or more, or 27 or more for people with a weight-related condition like high blood pressure. It and sister drug Ozempic, which is approved for type 2 diabetes, have soared in popularity, sweeping across social media sites and garnering mentions at the Oscars and on \u201cSaturday Night Live.\u201d\u201cWith rising rates of obesity, there is an increased demand\u201d for drugs like Wegovy, said Dr. Priya Jaisinghani, an endocrinologist and obesity medicine specialist at NYU Langone Health. She said that she hasn\u2019t had issues filling prescriptions of Wegovy recently but that she had in the past.Ozempic prescriptions can be easy to get online. Its popularity for weight loss is hurting those who need it mostWegovy is one of the brand names for semaglutide, which is part of a class of drugs that mimic the effects of an appetite-regulating hormone called GLP-1.  They stimulate the release of insulin, which helps lower blood sugar, and slow the passage of food through the gut. The FDA approved semaglutide for diabetes as Ozempic in 2017 and for weight loss as Wegovy in 2021. But Wegovy soon went into shortage amid production problems, and some supply problems have continued.People who take Wegovy for weight loss must continue to use it to maintain the effects; dropped pounds can return when they stop.Celebrities such as Chelsea Handler and Elon Musk have talked about using semaglutide or Wegovy. The Hollywood connection has been so strong that Novo Nordisk included in its \u201cFrequently Asked Questions\u201d section an inquiry about why celebrities can get Wegovy when it is unavailable for others. The drugmaker noted that it can\u2019t control which specific people receive its medicines but said \u201cwe reinforce who our medicines are intended to treat based on their clinical trials and FDA-approved indications.\u201dWHO advisers to consider whether obesity medication should be added to Essential Medicines ListInterest is so high, Novo Nordisk said, that it will pause some promotion of Wegovy \u201cto avoid stimulating further demand.\u201dWegovy is designed to be taken once a week by self-injection. Patients start on the lowest dose, 0.25 milligrams, and move up to the maintenance dose, 2.4 milligrams, over the course of 16 weeks. The lowest three doses are the ones Novo Nordisk says will have limited supply.This gradual dosage increase is designed to limit gastrointestinal side effects like nausea, vomiting and diarrhea.\u201cThey are very challenging to take,\u201d said Dr. Ethan Weiss, a preventional cardiologist at the University of California San Francisco and entrepreneur-in-residence at venture capital firm Third Rock. Still, he notes, \u201cthey are a really valuable option for those who have struggled and don\u2019t want or are not eligible for surgery.\u201dNovo Nordisk said hundreds of thousands of people in the US are on Wegovy, and it noted that an additional contract manufacturer recently started production to help increase supply. In the meantime, it recommends that people currently taking Wegovy contact their pharmacy about refills at least a week or two earlier than normal, and try multiple pharmacies if the first one doesn\u2019t have the drug. It also suggests that health-care providers consider the potential supply disruptions when considering whether to start new patients on Wegovy.Although Ozempic and Wegovy contain the same key ingredient, Novo Nordisk noted that \u201cthe products are not interchangeable\u201d; they have different indications, dosages, prescribing information and paces of titrating up.every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.Ozempic has had supply issues as well for people with diabetes, even prompting British Columbia to move to restrict its sale amid a surge in prescriptions, many from Americans seeking the drug across the border.There have also been supply constraints on a similar medicine made by Eli Lilly, Mounjaro, which is approved only for diabetes, Jaisinghani said.She recommended against seeking weight-loss drugs through other avenues like medical tourism and compounding pharmacies.\u201cIt\u2019s very important to speak to your doctor regarding your plan on how and where you are obtaining medications to make sure they are the FDA-approved formulation and safe for use,\u201d she said."

        "text": ".Medieval observations of the moon are helping present-day researchers study a mysterious cluster of volcanic eruptions on Earth.Monks, and other scribes from the era, made detailed descriptions of lunar eclipses, when the moon is fully in Earth\u2019s shadow. At the time, the eventswere thought to foretell calamities.Their writings often noted a reddish orb surrounding the eclipsed moon, as well as more unusual instances where the eclipsed moon seemed to disappear entirely from the sky.\u201cThe old folk had never seen it like this time, with the location of the disk of the Moon not visible, just as if it had disappeared during the eclipse\u2026 It was truly something to fear,\u201d wrote Japanese poet Fujiwara no Teika, of an unprecedented dark eclipse observed on December 2, 1229.The four astronauts NASA picked for the first crewed moon mission in 50 yearsWhat the chroniclers could not have known was this: An exceptionally dark eclipse is associated with the presence of a large amount of volcanic dust in the atmosphere, according to S\u00e9bastien Guillet, a senior research associate at the Institute for Environmental Sciences at the University of Geneva.Guilletbelieves medieval manuscripts contain an important source of information about a string of large but little-understood volcanic eruptionson Earth.\u201cImproving our knowledge of these otherwise mysterious eruptions is crucial to understanding whether and how past volcanism affected not only climate but also society during the Middle Ages,\u201d Guillet said in a news release.Over a five-year period, Guillet and his colleagues scoured 12th and 13th-century European, Middle Eastern and East Asian sources for lunar descriptions, which \u2014  when combined with ice core and tree ring data \u2014 are allowing more accurate dating of what scientists think must have been some of the biggest volcanic eruptions the world has seen.Of the 64 total lunar eclipses that occurred in Europe between 1100 and 1300, the study,, found documentation of 51. In six of these cases, these documents also reported that the moon was exceptionally dark \u2014 in May 1110, January 1172, December 1229,\u2009May 1258, November 1258\u2009and November 1276.These dates correspond with five major volcanic eruptions identified from traces of volcanic ash found in polar ice cores \u2014 in 1108, 1171, 1230, 1257 and 1276.  (Of these, only the location of the 1257 eruption is known, at the Samalas volcano on the Indonesian island of Lombok.)\u201cThese eruptions were significantly more powerful than some of the most well-known volcanic eruptions in recent history,\u201d Guillet said. \u201cOne of these powerful eruptions, the 1257 Samalas eruption, stands as one of the largest volcanic eruptions of the past millennium.\u201d\u201cThe resulting volcanic aerosols blocked sunlight and caused widespread climate disruption. Historical records show that the following summer in Europe\u2026 was one of the coldest summers recorded over the past millennium.\u201dResearchers believe volcanic eruptions took place three to 20 months before the dark eclipses, based on observations of more recent eruptions and their effect on lunar eclipses.How scientists are decoding what the past smelled like\u201cWe only knew about these eruptions because they left traces in the ice of Antarctica and Greenland,\u201d said studycoauthor Clive Oppenheimer, a professor at the University of Cambridge, in a news release.\u201cBy putting together the information from ice cores and the descriptions from medieval texts, we can now make better estimates of when and where some of the biggest eruptions of this period occurred.\u201dClimate scientists usually identify past volcanic eruptions by measuring the amount \u2014 and acidity \u2014 of volcanic ash in cores drilled from polar ice, or by inferring abrupt temperature changes in tree ring records.How 'seafloor detectives' uncovered the secrets of the world's biggest underwater volcanoHowever, these sources sometimes conflict, because volcanic eruptions disrupt weather patterns in different ways depending on their location, intensity and timing, said Andrea Seim, chair of Forest Growth and Dendroecology at the University of Freiburg\u2019s Institute of Forest Sciences in Germany, and Eduardo Zorita, a senior scientist at Helmholtz-Zentrum Hereon, a German research center, in a commentary that accompanied the study.\u201cThe strength of Guillet and co-workers\u2019 study lies in the precision with which the authors estimated the timing of volcanic eruptions \u2014 pinpointing the year, and even in some cases the month, of the event,\u201d the pair noted. Seim and Zorita were not involved in the research.The study said the new research would help to shed light on the onset of the Little Ice Age, a period of cold weather between 1280 and 1340 that disrupted harvests, saw the advance of European glaciers, and, according to some historians,"

        "text": "As an emergency room nurse, Terry Foster has cared for people on their worst days. He loves his work, and as president of the Emergency Nurses Association, a group that represents about 50,000 nurses, he\u2019s met countless others who share a similar commitment to helping others. But he\u2019s concerned about the future of his profession.\u201cI\u2019ve worked in the emergency department 45 years, and you\u2019re not going to hear people say that again. I don\u2019t think you\u2019re going to see that kind of tenure anymore,\u201d he said.About 100,000 nurses left the workforce due to pandemic-related burnout and stress, survey findsSomething changed with the Covid-19 pandemic, Foster said. That change is among the many captured in the, a nurse staffing company.The biannual survey of 18,000 nurses, published Monday, points to what AMN Chief Clinical Officer Dr. Cole Edmonson called a \u201cperfect storm\u201d of problems for the profession that could leave the US health care industry without the nurses it needs.The survey, which was conducted in January, shows a group of professionals who care very much about their work, but it also shows a significant decline in work satisfaction and a significant increase in stress levels. Many are thinking about leaving the profession.\u201cA crisis in nursing is upon us,\u201d Edmonson says in the survey.Nurses typically like their profession, surveys have found over the years. For more than a decade, their career satisfaction was around 80% to 85%. Yet when they were asked in the new poll whether they were extremely satisfied or somewhat satisfied with their choice of nursing as a career, the number dropped a full 10 percentage points from the most recent AMN survey, done in 2021.If 71% of nurses say they are satisfied with their work in 2023, that\u2019s still a lot of people, but the drop is concerning, said Christin Stanford, vice president of client solutions for AMN Healthcare.\u201cI don\u2019t think any of us were prepared to see just how drastic the drop was in career job satisfaction, mental health and well-being, andwhatthe overall feeling of the nurse profession today was,\u201d she said.Another troubling sign, she said, is that younger nurses seem less satisfied with their careers than older professionals.Pediatric hospital beds are in high demand for ailing children. Here's whyResearch has shown that nurses who are satisfied with their work typically stay on the job. But only 63% of millennials and 62% of Gen Zers said they were satisfied with their career choice, as opposed to 78% of baby boomers.\u201cThe overall data is very concerning. But if you segment out and look at a few different splices or populations within the survey data, it is even more distressing,\u201d Stanford said.The survey found that many nurses are thinking about leaving their jobs.Hospitals could face the most instability. Only 15% of hospital nurses say they will continue in the same job in one year,.Nearly a third of all the nurses surveyed said they are likely to leave the profession, up 7 points from the 2021 survey.Only 40% said they will stay in the same job in one year, a 5 percentage-point drop since 2021. The rest said they will look for work as a travel nurse, move to part-time or per diem work, take a job outside of nursing or patient care, or return to school.Why urgent care centers are popping up everywhereFoster, who works as an emergency room nurse in Northern Kentucky and was not involved in the AMN survey, in part faults typical burnout. About 100,000 registered nurses in the US left the workplace due to the stresses of the Covid-19 pandemic, according to the results of a survey published this month by the National Council of State Boards of Nursing.Foster says patients and their families have also changed in recent years.\u201cThere\u2019s just a new level of incivility from the public,\u201d he said.The same violence seen in social media videos of people attacking flight attendants or fast food workers is happening more and more in health care settings, he said.are five times more likely to experience workplace violence than employees in all other industries,surveys have found.\u201cWe\u2019re just trying to take care of people, and they\u2019re lashing out at us,\u201d Foster said. \u201cIt\u2019s patients who don\u2019t want to wait, or they act out or are very dramatic or violent. And sometimes our patients are fine, but their families will lash out at us and threaten us.\u201dThis new survey showed that 4 out of 5 nurses said they experienced \u201ca great deal\u201d or \u201ca lot of stress\u201d in their work, an increase of 16 points since 2021.Health care is in crisis. New York's nurses strike is just the latest signMore nurses said they worried that their job was taking a toll on their health, and they often felt emotionally drained.Nearly 40% of nurses surveyed said they felt burnt out. Nearly a third said they felt misunderstood or underappreciated, and about the same number felt that they were not getting what they needed out of their job.Another part of the problem is a lack of adequate staffing.Only a third of those surveyed said they had the ideal time they needed with patients, a 10-point decrease from 2021. The percentage of nurses who were satisfied with the quality of care that they were able to provide fell 11 points, from 75% in 2021 to 64% in 2023.Stanford said that in just a couple of years, the profession will be 1 million nurses short, partially because of a demographic change.Baby boomers are reaching the age of retirement, and there will be more demand for nurses because boomers are also reaching the age when they need more medical care.Opinion: How to fix American health care, according to 6 expertsAnother problem is education. While the number of candidates who passed the nursing licensure exam has steadily grown over the years, according to the union National Nurses United, there are still many more people who want to become nurses than there are classes. Schools just don\u2019t have enough people to teach, Stanford said.There may also be a lack of interest in doing the work in today\u2019s environment.There are about a million registered nurses with active licenses who are not employed as nurses, according to a National Nurses United analysis of Bureau of Labor Statistics data from 2021.Coming out of the pandemic, far too many hospitals cut corners on staffing and allowed a higher nurse-to-patient ratio, said Kristine Kittelson, an RN in Austin and a National Nurses United member. Essentially, that\u2019s placed nurses in a moral dilemma, she said, where they can\u2019t completely help their patients even if they want to.\u201cWe are being put in these challenging work environments that really forced us to feel like we, as nurses, aren\u2019t providing the best care that we can,\u201d said Kittelson. who also was not involved in the new survey. \u201cWe\u2019re just not being given the resources that we need and the staffing that we need.\u201dMore flexibility in schedules could help, Stanford said. Do nurses have enough flexibility to take time off and take care of themselves?every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.Nearly every nurse who participated in the new survey said they wanted increased staff support, a reduction in the number of patients per nurse, an increase in salary, a safer working environment and more opportunities to share their input with decision-making.\u201cThis is a great profession, and it\u2019s very rewarding, but I think that the pandemic has really shown how undervalued we are,\u201d Kittelson said. \u201cWe should just be able to put in a position to give patients what they deserve and not feel stressed.\u201d"

        "text": "An experimental Alzheimer\u2019s medication slowed declines in patients\u2019 ability to think clearly and perform daily tasks by more than a third in a large clinical trial, drugmaker Eli Lilly said Wednesday.Based on the results, in people with early symptomatic Alzheimer\u2019s disease, Lilly said it plans to file for approval from the US Food and Drug Administration by the end of June.The medicine, donanemab, works by removing plaque buildups in the brain known as amyloid that are a hallmark of Alzheimer\u2019s disease. However, there were some side effects reported; there were three deaths in the trial among people taking the drug, two of which were attributed to adverse events such as brain swelling or microhemorrhages, known as amyloid-related imaging abnormalities or ARIA. The trial was run in more than 1,700 patients for 18 months.Alzheimer's drug lecanemab receives accelerated approval amid safety concerns\u201cFor every medicine, for every disease, there are potential risks and potential benefits,\u201d said Lilly\u2019s chief scientific and medical officer, Dr. Daniel Skovronsky. But he noted that almost half of the participants taking the drug, 47%, showed no decline on a key measure of cognition over the course of a year, compared with 29% of people taking a placebo.That\u2019s \u201cthe kind of efficacy that\u2019s never been seen before in Alzheimer\u2019s disease,\u201d Skovronsky said.Alzheimer\u2019s affects more than 6 million Americans, with an estimated 1.7 million to 2 million people over 65 in the early stages of the disease, according to Lilly. Drug development for Alzheimer\u2019s has been riddled with failures, but Lilly\u2019s drug is among a new group showing promise. The first, Eisai and Biogen\u2019s Leqembi, received accelerated FDA approval in January.Skovronsky, who noted he\u2019s been working in the field of Alzheimer\u2019s for 25 years, said the new class of medicines is different because of \u201cthe amount of amyloid they can clear and how quickly they can clear it.\u201dThe medicine is given by infusion once a month. Donanemab clears amyloid so effectively, the company says, that a majority of patients in the trial \u2013 52% \u2013 were able to stop taking the medicine by one year, and 72% were able to do so by a year and a half. Researchers will continue to monitor these patients\u2019 progress.In the trial, researchers looked at the participants in two groups, separated by levels of a brain protein known as tau. A 35% slowing in cognitive and functional decline was seen in the group with intermediate levels of tau, whose disease hadn\u2019t progressed as far. When this intermediate group was combined with the group with higher levels of tau, the figure was 22%. The results have not been peer-reviewed or published in a journal.every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.Lillywith the FDA for donanemab based on earlier results but was rejected in January as the agency sought more data. With these results, the company will file for full approval, which is expected to lead to broader insurance reimbursement for the medicine. Leqembi was approved on an accelerated basis in January, and Medicare is not expected to cover the drug broadly until it receives full approval as well, most likely by early July.Leqembi is priced at $26,500 a year. Skovronsky declined to discuss potential pricing for donanemab before the drug is approved."

        "text": "A team of doctors in Boston successfully performed a novel fetal surgery to treat a rare brain condition known as vein of Galen malformation.Although in utero surgery \u2013 performed before a baby is born \u2013 has been used for other conditions, this ultrasound-guided procedure was among the first for this condition. Details of the procedure, which took place in March, were published in the journalon Thursday.A sound you can't hear but may one day change your lifeThe condition occurs when the blood vessel that carries blood from the brain to the heart, also known as the vein of Galen, doesn\u2019t develop correctly. The malformation, known as VOGM, results in an overwhelming amount of blood stressing the vein and heart and can lead to a cascade of health problems.\u201cTremendous brain injuries and immediate heart failure after birth are the two big challenges,\u201d Dr. Darren Orbach, a radiologist at Boston Children\u2019s Hospital and expert in treating VOGM, told CNN.Typically, infants are treated after they\u2019re born using a catheter to insert tiny coils to slow down blood flow. However, Orbach said, the treatment often happens too late.Despite advancements in care, \u201c50 to 60 percent of all babies with this condition will get very sick immediately. And for those, it looks like there\u2019s about a 40 percent mortality,\u201d Orbach said. About half of infants that survive experience severe neurological and cognitive issues, he said.When they learned of their fourth pregnancy, Derek and Kenyatta Coleman of Baton Rouge, Louisiana, were surprised and excited. Kenyatta, 36, and Derek, 39, have been married for seven years and were ready to welcome a new addition to their family.Kenyatta said nothing seemed particularly notable about the pregnancy. After having three children, Kenyatta thought of ultrasounds as routine appointments.Scars unite new mom, son\u201cBaby was doing well. The anatomy scan came back unremarkable. All of her biophysical profiles were all unremarkable,\u201d said Kenyatta, who spoke to CNN exclusively.The Colemans even did genetic testing that characterized Kenyatta\u2019s pregnancy as \u201clow risk,\u201d she said: \u201cWe honestly thought that we were in the clear.\u201dBut when Kenyatta went for an ultrasound at 30 weeks into her pregnancy, something was different. She remembers her doctor sitting her down and saying she was worried.\u201cShe shared with me that something wasn\u2019t right in terms of the baby\u2019s brain and also her heart was enlarged,\u201d Kenyatta remembers.After more investigation, there was a diagnosis: VOGM.But the Colemans had learned about a clinical trial run by Brigham and Women\u2019s and Boston Children\u2019s hospitals that could provide treatment before their baby was born.Kenyatta remembers being told about the possible risks \u2013 preterm labor, or brain hemorrhage for the fetus \u2013 but the Colemans felt there was no other option for them. They wanted to join the trial.On March 15, exactly one month after the ultrasound that spotted the malformation, Kenyatta underwent surgery.But for this surgery, there were two patients: Kenyatta and her baby.Doctors had to make sure the fetus was facing the right position, with its head facing the mother\u2019s abdominal wall. Dr. Louise Wilkins-Haug, division director of Maternal Fetal Medicine and Reproductive Genetics at Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital, partnered with Orbach to make sure that the fetus was not only in the right position for the procedure, but stayed there.Meet the baby who was born twiceWilkins-Haug explained they used a technique borrowed from previous in utero cardiac surgeries. Once the fetus is in the optimal position, it \u201cgets a small injection of medication so that it\u2019s not moving and it is also getting a small injection of medication for pain relief,\u201d Wilkins-Haug said.From there, the doctors inserted a needle through the abdominal wall, carefully threading a catheter through the needle, so that the tiny metal coils can fill up the vein, slow the blood flow and reduce the pressure.The baby showed signs of improvement immediately, with scans showing decreased blood pressure in key areas.\u201cIt was exhilarating at the moment that we had technical success at doing the embolization,\u201d said Orbach.But success wasn\u2019t defined by that moment alone, but rather, what would follow.\u201cWill she be able to continuously show progress after? Will she need just additional support after I have her? Will she go into immediate heart failure still?\u201d Kenyatta wondered.After the procedure, Kenyatta was slowly leaking amniotic fluid. Two days later, she went into labor at 34 weeks.On March 17, Denver Coleman was born, weighing 4 pounds and 1 ounce.\u201cI heard her cry for the first time and that just, I \u2013 I can\u2019t even put into words how I felt at that moment,\u201d remembers Kenyatta.\u201cIt was just, you know, the most beautiful moment being able to hold her, gaze up on her and then hear her cry.\u201dHer doctors were also pleased. \u201cIn the immediate new newborn period, she was very stable and didn\u2019t need any of the immediate treatments that they typically need, whether it\u2019s placing coils or whether it\u2019s supporting her heart function with medications,\u201d said Wilkins-Haug. \u201cOur hope is that she won\u2019t need any further coils placed.\u201dDerek remembers visiting Denver for the first time in the neonatal intensive care unit and doctors asked if he wanted to kiss her.every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\u201cI gave her a kiss and she was just making little baby noises and stuff,\u201d he said. \u201cThat was all I needed right there.\u201dNow, nearly two months after Denver was born, she continues to thrive, spending most of her time sleeping and eating. She\u2019s not taking any medications for heart failure, and her neurological exam is normal. There\u2019s no indication that she needs any additional interventions.\u201cShe\u2019s shown us from the very beginning that she was a fighter,\u201d Kenyatta said, \u201cshe\u2019s demonstrated \u2026 \u201cHey, I wanna be here.\u2019 \u201c"

        "text": "Disney\u2019s animated hit \u201cLilo & Stitch\u201d is getting the live-action treatment, but a reported casting decision has set off a new conversation about colorism in Hollywood.Some fans were disappointed afterreported last week that Sydney Agudong was set to play Nani, Lilo\u2019s overworked older sister and legal guardian. Born and raised in Hawaii, Agudong is mixed race. Though it is unclear if she has Hawaiian heritage, critics of the reported casting have focused on the issue of colorism \u2013 in the 2002 animated version, Nani has dark skin and distinctive indigenous features, while Agudong is light-skinned.Hawaii has the largest proportion ofin the nation, and because of theon the islands, it\u2019s common for residents to be a combination of White, Asian and Native Hawaiian. That means there are plenty of Hawaiians with lighter skin, and having lighter skin doesn\u2019t make a person less Hawaiian, said OniMasai Connor, who lives in Oahu and is Black and Hawaiian.But by choosing a light-skinned actor to play a character who originally had dark skin, Disney is reinforcing deep-rooted notions about what features are considered acceptable or beautiful in society, she added.\u201cMy issue with the casting is the fact that we live in a supremacist society that favors light skin, therefore this casting contributes to a level of erasure,\u201d she wrote in a message to CNN. \u201cWe see so often in all genres of cinema \u2013 stories based on people that are dark skinned in real life, only to be played by someone lighter in a film.\u201dDisney, as well as representatives for Agudong, have not responded to requests for comment.The new \u201cLilo & Stitch\u201d is based on an animated film and Nani is a fictional, animated character. But unlike \u201cThe Little Mermaid,\u201d which is rooted in mythology despite receivingover Halle Bailey\u2019s casting in the live-action remake, \u201cLilo & Stitch\u201d draws from a very real culture and people.Nani and Lilo\u2019s Hawaiian identity, as well as their skin tone, are important to the story, Connor and others said.For example, one scene from the animated film sees Nani characterize the luau where she works as a \u201cstupid, fakey luau\u201d \u2013 a nod to how thehas exploited Native Hawaiian people and their customs.\u201cNani working at the \u2018fakey luau\u2019 alone and even using the phrase \u2018fakey luau\u2019 to describe that job was an aggressively political statement, involving colorism, indigeneity and the specific history of colonialism the US has imposed upon the nation of Hawaii,\u201d one Twitter user.Another major plot point of the film revolves around Nani\u2019s precarious economic situation. Nani has been Lilo\u2019s sole caretaker ever since their parents died in a car crash. But as Lilo\u2019s companion Stitch causes chaos at her various places of employment, Nani struggles to hold down a job and is repeatedly warned by a social worker that she could lose custody of her sister. The storyline echoes the real-life crisis of, as well as thein the US child welfare system.\u201cThe conflict occurring in Lilo and Stitch being about the colonialist state attempting to pull this tiny \u2018broken\u2019 native Hawaiian family apart is made more apparent by their both being darker skinned girls,\u201d another Twitter user. \u201cCasting a lighter skinned Hawaiian to play Nani interferes with that.\u201dColorism has long been a problem in Hollywood and the broader entertainment industry \u2013 stars such asandhave been vocal about losing opportunities over their dark skin, while others includingandhave acknowledged the privileges that come with having lighter skin.The live-action \u201cLilo & Stitch\u201d is only the latest in a long line of projects that have faced accusations of colorism. A similar conversation took place over Disney\u2019s live-action remake of \u201cAladdin\u201d when Naomi Scott, who is of mixed English and Indian descent, was cast as Princess Jasmine.\u201cWhy is it that, when casting the wife of a terrorist or extra number four in shows like Jack Ryan or Homeland, it seems easy enough to find a dark brown or Middle Eastern woman for the role, but when casting a Disney princess, directors and casting agents are stumped?\u201d Erum Salam wrote in a 2019 piece for.'In the Heights' reignites long-standing conversations about colorism in the Latinx communitySimilarily, thewas criticized over the fact that all of its Black stars were light-skinned, while Lin-Manuel Miranda\u2019s film adaptation of \u201cIn the Heights\u201d also got heat for its lack of dark-skinned, Afro-Latinx actors in leading roles. (\u201cGossip Girl\u201d was rebooted on HBO Max, while \u201cIn the Heights\u201d was distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures. Both companies share parent company Warner Bros. Discovery with CNN.)Connor said she\u2019s concerned that casting a light-skinned actor in the role of Nani in \u201cLilo & Stitch\u201d will further misperceptions of what Hawaiians look like. As a Black and Hawaiian woman, she\u2019s often felt that others don\u2019t see her as Hawaiian because of her skin tone. That\u2019s why seeing a darker-skinned actor play Nani would have been meaningful.\u201cThe question really isn\u2019t, \u2018Is she enough?\u2019 It is \u2018Am I enough?\u2019 and that is so unfortunate considering the original animation did such a wonderful job at making ALL of us feel seen, no matter the skin tone,\u201d Connor wrote. \u201cIt\u2019s truly a loss, at no fault of Agudong herself.\u201dAgudong isn\u2019t to blame for systemic problems that have long plagued the industry, Connor said. Though Connor is disappointed, she hopes the \u201cLilo & Stitch\u201d remake will otherwise stay true to the original, which she loved so much growing up. And she said she\u2019s still looking forward to seeing the film when it\u2019s released."

        "text": "\u201cand Ana de Armas\u201d is about all that\u2019s required to make the sales pitch fora spirited if familiar action-based romantic comedy, where the sparring banter generally outshines the muscular stunts. Throw in clever cameos and this Apple TV+ movie delivers on its promise of unpretentious fun.\u201cGhosted\u201d offers a reminder that Evans possessed considerable appeal (including his work as a romantic interest in \u201cThe Nanny Diaries\u201d) before he, and de Armas has super-spy credentials from the James Bond movieandone of her previous collaborations (along with the more successful) with Evans.Director Dexter Fletcher (\u201cRocketman\u201d) relies on the natural chemistry between the two to carry the simple premise, which begins with the unassuming Cole (Evans), who works on his family farm, meeting de Armas\u2019 alluring Sadie, arguing with her about whether she has what it takes to raise a houseplant. From there, the pair go on one very long, very good first date.Coming off a breakup, Cole is understandably smitten, and wounded when she doesn\u2019t immediately respond to his texts. So with encouragement from his parents (Amy Sedaris and Tate Donovan), and ignoring his sister\u2019s warning that he \u201ccame on way too strong,\u201d he impulsively tracks a left-behind item of his to her location in London, where the surprise turns out to be on him, as Sadie is quickly revealed to be a clandestine operative for the CIA.Moreover, shades of \u201cNorth by Northwest,\u201d the bad guys, led by Adrien Brody\u2019s sneering villain, mistake Cole for the mysterious agent who has been mucking up their plans, dragging him into Sadie\u2019s cloak-and-dagger quest for a dangerous bioweapon that Hitchcock used to refer to as a MacGuffin.Mostly, the spy shenanigans serve as a backdrop to the squabbling and making up that goes with Cole\u2019s shock about Sadie\u2019s secret life, the danger to which he has inadvertently exposed them both and the fact that everyone keeps telling the pair that they should \u201cget a room\u201d when they\u2019re arguing.With a screenplay from the \u201cDeadpool\u201d team of Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick andscribes Chris McKenna and Erik Sommers, \u201cGhosted\u201d exhibits a sense of playfulness throughout, with Evans appearing to relish the opportunity to portray an everyman thrust into all these heroic hijinks. (While they go to great lengths to stress that Cole wrestled in high school, in these bouts, as Sadie informs him, he can\u2019t expect his out-for-blood opponents to tap out.)Frankly, the star power alone might have made \u201cGhosted\u201d a reasonably solid box-office attraction, but with the movie heading directly to streaming \u2013 where just garnering attention is more than half the battle \u2013 it\u2019s pretty much a slam dunk for the posters alone.Unlike the needy Cole, \u201cGhosted\u201d doesn\u2019t ask for anything more than a couple intermittently attentive hours of your time. Thanks to Evans and de Armas, it\u2019s the sort of invitation that\u2019s pretty hard to ignore."

        "text": "\u201cPeter Pan & Wendy\u201d wants to conjure magic but turns out to be low on fairy dust, yielding a dreary live-action adaptation of the 1953 movie that transforms Neverland into what vaguely feels like a discount version of Pandora. Modest narrative upgrades help lift the Disney+ film above the service\u2019s recent \u201cPinocchio,\u201d but clearing that very low bar amounts to damnation with faint praise.There have been numerous live-action renderings of J.M. Barrie\u2019s classic, from \u201cHook\u201d to \u201cPeter Pan\u201d to simply \u201cPan\u201d \u2013 plus \u201cFinding Neverland,\u201d which cast Johnny Depp as Barrie in a touching look at the play\u2019s origins.Other than a few welcome and necessary changes to rid the Disney animated film of more problematic elements, and a bit more backstory explaining this Captain Hook (Jude Law) and his semi-depressed demeanor, this version pretty closely adheres to the basic blueprint, pondering that age-old question about children\u2019s reluctance to grow up.Wendy (Ever Anderson) says as much when her mother (Molly Parker) chides her for clinging to childhood, telling her mom tartly, \u201cWhat if I don\u2019t want your life?\u201d Yet that rather philosophical conundrum quickly gives way to the arrival of Peter Pan (Alexander Molony) and Tinkerbell (Yara Shahidi, making the most of a near-silent role), who whisk Wendy and her brothers off to Neverland.Pan\u2019s Lost Boys (some of whom are girls) receive somewhat short shrift in this telling, while Tiger Lily (Alyssa Wapanat\u00e2hk) has a more enhanced role. Indeed, by giving Wendy a more active part in the heroics indicative of the title change, this movie features more female empowerment all around, dispensing with much of the petty jealousy and girlish mooning over Peter that didn\u2019t age particularly well during the last 70 years.Still, there\u2019s only so much that \u201cThe Green Knight\u201d director David Lowery (who shares script credit with Toby Halbrooks) can do within the confines of toeing the Disney line, and even believing in fairies can\u2019t bring the movie to consistent life.While there are snippets of the original music, the film forgoes songs other than a few shanties the pirates croon when not trying to kill Pan and his mates. That said, the action is reasonably tame, other than the sheer size of the crocodile, who fleetingly demonstrates why Hook is rightly terrified of it.Disney has obviously made live-action remakes of its animated properties a staple of its creative arsenal, flitting between more ambitious theatrical productions (seeand the upcoming) and those sent straight to streaming (among them the aforementioned \u201cPinocchio\u201d and).Yet the obvious appeal of introducing or reintroducing these stories to young audiences while allowing their parents to watch along works better if there\u2019s some creative spark to invigorate the exercise, and maybe even hold the adults\u2019 attention as opposed to letting them drift off to second screens (or dreamland).\u201cPeter Pan & Wendy\u201d isn\u2019t a complete failure, but nor does this return to Neverland pass that test; rather, it\u2019s another case of a Disney production that \u2013 unlike the beloved and venerable story that inspired it \u2013 never truly takes flight."

        "text": "\u201cAre You There God? It\u2019s Me, Margaret\u201d is a classic coming-of-age tale, but thebook receives the ageless treatment it deserves in a movie that captures the 1970 vibe (starting with the soundtrack) while completely transcending it. Sweet, charming and thoughtful, this theatrical release will likely land on a streaming service sooner than later, but it appears destined to have a very, very long shelf life.Writer-director Kelly Fremon Craig\u2019s film debut,turned out to be a terrific training ground for this tween version of youthful angst, and a protagonist who \u2013 having been raised without any religion by her Christian mom (Rachel McAdams) and Jewish dad (Benny Safdie) \u2013 seeks help from God when the family abruptly decides to relocate from New York to New Jersey.\u201cDon\u2019t let New Jersey be too horrible,\u201d Margaret (Abby Ryder Fortson, previously featured ingiving a giant-sized performance) pleads before embarking on the move, which, among other things, greatly upsets her paternal grandmother (Kathy Bates, yet again guilty of scene-stealing larceny).Beyond leaving her school and friends behind, Margaret enters this strange new suburban world at a critical phase in her life, falling into the circle of a domineering girl, Nancy (Elle Graham), whose prodding makes Margaret even more obsessed with the vagaries of puberty. That isn\u2019t helped when Nancy coaxes her to steal her dad\u2019s Playboy, fueling anxieties about a body that isn\u2019t developing at the rate she wishes.\u201cAre You There God?\u201d could easily drift into after-school special territory, but it has more edge than that. For starters, Margaret\u2019s exploration of religion \u2013 which drove a wedge between her mom, Barbara, and her parents \u2013 helps elevate it, as does the parallel plot about Barbara trying to fit in among the PTA mothers and fretting about her domestic skills.While the songs and styles set the period mood, the subject matter possesses a universal and timeless quality, from the awkwardness of watching sex-education videos to the discomfort associated with that first crush.Produced by James L. Brooks\u2019 company, which has a long association with these kind of character-driven films, \u201cAre You There God?\u201d feels like a throwback to another era of entertainment as well. Such movies have struggled of late at the box office, and this certainly isn\u2019t the kind of fare that tends to cause people to rush out to theaters these days (although mothers and daughters looking for quality bonding time, in particular, could do a whole lot worse).Still, despite all her tween misery, \u201cMargaret\u201d should make some streaming service very happy. Because for an audience seeking something that doesn\u2019t speak down to kids, or anyone who can remember being one, \u201cAre You There God?\u201d addresses youthful preoccupations in a refreshingly relatable manner that feels almost heaven-sent."

        "link": "https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/02/health/florida-abortion-term-pregnancy/index.html",
        "text": "A Florida woman, unable to get an abortion in her state, carried to term a baby who had no kidneys.Deborah Dorbert\u2019s son Milo died in her arms on March 3, shortly after he was born, just as her doctors had predicted he would.\u201cHe gasped for air a couple of times when I held him,\u201d said Dorbert, 33. \u201cI watched my child take his first breath, and I held him as he took his last one.\u201dShe said her pregnancy was proceeding normally until November, when, at 24 weeks, an ultrasound showed that the fetus did not have kidneys and that she had hardly any amniotic fluid. Not only was the baby sure to die, her doctors told her, but the pregnancy put her at especially high risk of preeclampsia, a potentially deadly complication.Her doctors told her it was too late to terminate the pregnancy in Florida, which bans nearly all abortions after 15 weeks. The only options were to go out of state\u202fto get an abortion or to carry the baby to full term, and Dorbert and her husband didn\u2019t have the money to travel.What followed was an agonizing 13 weeks of carrying a baby she knew would die and worrying about her own health. It left Dorbert with severe anxiety and depression for the first time in her life.allows abortions after 15 weeks if two doctors confirm the diagnosis of a fatal fetal abnormality in writing, but doctors in Florida and states with similar laws have been hesitant to terminate such pregnancies for fear someone will question whether the abnormality was truly fatal. The penalties for violating the law are severe: Doctors can go to prison and face heavy fines and legal fees.Interactive:A lonely struggle: Nine mothers share the mental health challenges they faced during \u2018the happiest time of their lives\u2019CNN reached out to Florida state Reps.andwho co-sponsored the state\u2019s 15-week ban, for comment on Dorbert\u2019s situation.Grall did not respond. Persons-Mulicka sent a statement.\u201cThe intent of the law is quite clear. We are providing mothers with the resources they need to raise healthy children, empowering doctors to help their patients make informed decisions, and shifting the conversation to valuing life,\u201d she wrote.Last month, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis signed intoan even more restrictive measure that would ban most abortions in the state after six weeks, with an exception for fatal fetal abnormalities.\u202fThe law won\u2019t go into effect until the state Supreme Court overturns its precedent on abortion or tosses out a case challenging state abortion restrictions.Deborah met Lee in 2014 while they were working at Publix in Lakeland, Florida, where she was a clerk and he was a team leader in the grocery department. They married three years later, and their son Kaiden was born a year after that.Last year, the couple was thrilled when they found out they were going to have a second child. On the day before Thanksgiving, when she was 23 weeks pregnant, Dorbert brought Kaiden to an ultrasound appointment.Texas sued by women who say state's abortion bans put their health at riskThe 4-year-old was enthralled, looking at the screen and following along with the ultrasound technician as she pointed out the baby\u2019s features.\u201cHe\u2019d go, \u2018yeah, there\u2019s the eye\u2019 or \u2018there\u2019s the hand,\u2019 \u201d Dorbert remembered. \u201cHe was excited that he could see the baby on the monitor.\u201dBut abruptly, the technician stopped pointing at the screen and left the room to get the obstetrician.Her obstetrician\u2019s ultrasound report that day shows a grim diagnosis: There was no right kidney, and it was unclear whether there was a left kidney. In addition, the baby had too little amniotic fluid, and the heart was swollen. The obstetrician referred Dorbert to a high-risk pregnancy expert.Because of the holiday, it took a week before the Dorberts could get in to see the specialist. They said a more detailed ultrasound at that appointment showed that the baby had no kidneys at all and that the lungs were under-developed.The condition is called, and the specialist said it was \u201d \u2018incompatible with life,\u2019 \u201d Deborah remembers. She says the doctor told her the baby would be stillborn or would die within minutes, or at most hours, after birth.In this situation, doctors in states that allow abortions routinely give parents two options, according to Dr. Erika Werner, chair of the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at Tufts Medical Center and a spokesperson for the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine.Ohio abortion law meant weeks of 'anguish,' 'agony' for couple whose unborn child had organs outside her bodyOne is to induce birth and, if the baby is born alive, offer comfort care until death. The other is to carry the baby to full term.The Dorberts told the specialist that they wanted to induce birth, terminating the pregnancy, to spare the baby, themselves and their older son from suffering. They said the doctor agreed that this was a sound decision.Dorbert says the doctor told her that in all the cases he\u2019d seen, \u201cthat was always the outcome \u2013 someone\u2019s baby went stillborn \u2013 and the ones that did deliver, the babies pass shortly after birth.\u201dBut the doctor said he would need to check with his administration because of the Floridathat had gone into effect a few months before, banning most abortions after 15 weeks.The law makes an exception if \u201ctwo physicians certify in writing that, in reasonable medical judgment, the fetus has a fatal fetal abnormality,\u201d which the law defines as \u201ca terminal condition that, in reasonable medical judgment, regardless of the provision of life-saving medical treatment, is incompatible with life outside the womb and will result in death upon birth or imminently thereafter.\u201dAbout a month passed without a decision. Finally, Dorbert\u2019s obstetrician informed her that she wouldn\u2019t terminate the pregnancy. By this point, Dorbert was 27 weeks along.Dr. Stephanie Ros, a high-risk pregnancy expert in Tampa and a spokesperson for the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine, said she\u2019s not surprised that the doctor was unwilling to do the termination, considering that the law does not spell out exactly what would be considered a \u201cterminal condition.\u201d\u201cWith health care, there are very few black-and-whites. There are so many things that are a little bit nuanced,\u201d she said. \u201cThe moment the law came out, I think everyone was scrambling to try to figure out what exactly that language intended to convey.\u201dIf a doctor is convicted of running afoul of the law, the penalties are severe: up to five years in prison and $5,000 in fines, not to mention steep legal fees.Ros, an associate professor at the University of South Florida, said that after the law was passed, she and colleagues at Florida academic medical centers wrote a list of conditions they considered fatal fetal abnormalities. Renal agenesis \u2013 the absence of kidneys \u2013 was on the list.For that reason, she said, she would feel comfortable terminating a pregnancy with a fetus with this condition, but she \u201cabsolutely understands\u201d why doctors who aren\u2019t at academic medical centers, such as Dorbert\u2019s obstetrician, would refuse.\u201cIt\u2019s tricky because of how this law was written in the first place,\u201d she said.In Dorbert\u2019s situation, part of that trickiness has to do with the pregnancy 10 years ago of a woman she\u2019s never met.In 2012,, then a Republican US congresswoman from Washington state, found out she was pregnant with a baby who, like Dorbert\u2019s, had Potter syndrome. The condition affects more than just the kidneys. Functioning kidneys produce amniotic fluid, which a fetus \u201cbreathes\u201d into their lungs, and if there\u2019s not enough of it, the lungs don\u2019t develop properly.How Rep. Herrera Beutler saved her babyIn the womb, the baby can live with underdeveloped lungs because the placenta provides oxygen. But after birth, the baby is on their own.During her pregnancy, Herrera Beutler and her husband, Dan, heard the baby\u2019s heartbeat on an ultrasound.\u201cThat\u2019s pretty convincing. We know she\u2019s still alive,\u201d Dan Beutler told CNN in 2017. \u201cWe had this gut feeling of \u2018there has to be something.\u2019 \u201dThe couple sought out an experimental treatment at Johns Hopkins Medicine in which doctors transfused saline solution into the uterus to help mimic amniotic fluid. After a series of weekly infusions, their daughter,, was born 12 weeks prematurely. She survived on dialysis until she was big enough for a kidney transplant from her father.In a 2019in the Wall Street Journal, Herrera Beutler wrote that Abigail was a \u201chealthy, happy big sister.\u201d\u201cThrough divine intervention and some courageous doctors we now have Abigail in our lives,\u201d she wrote.Herrera Beutler, now a strategic adviser to the Children\u2019s Hospital Association, did not respond to requests for comment on this story.Abigail\u2019s parents have said she is the first baby without kidneys to survive childbirth. A 2014news release called Abigail\u2019s survival \u201ca medical marvel.\u201dIn 2017, Hopkins and several other academic medical centers started a clinical trial to see how well the saline treatment worked.In the study, 18 pregnant women whose fetuses did not have kidneys received uterine saline infusions. They went to the researchers one to three times a week, and each time, the doctors inserted a needle into their uterus for the procedure, which could take up to an hour. They made these visits for about 11 weeks.This conservative Christian couple in South Carolina have become outspoken advocates for abortion rightsFour of those 18 children are still alive, according to Dr. Jena Miller, an assistant professor at the Johns Hopkins Center for Fetal Therapy and co-principal investigator of the study.One baby was stillborn, and the other 17 were born prematurely and alive. Of those 17 babies, 14 survived to 2 weeks of age. Over the next two years, eight of those 14 children died without ever leaving the hospital.The remaining six babies spent an average of about six months in the hospital and then went home. Two later died; the other four are on dialysis. None has received a kidney transplant.Miller presented preliminary results from the study at a Februaryof the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine. The research has not been peer-reviewed or published in a professional journal.She noted that in the study, even when babies did survive, they are \u201cmedically complex and have required multiple surgeries.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re subjecting parents to a very medically complex child, and for some families, they\u2019re happy. They\u2019re OK with doing that,\u201d she said. \u201cThe family that chooses that, they\u2019re all in for that. But it\u2019s their choice to make. There are absolutely families that just do not have the resources or the capacity for that journey. They would not choose that journey for themselves or their child.\u201dBy the time the Dorberts got the news that her doctors wouldn\u2019t terminate Deborah\u2019s pregnancy, she was 27 weeks along.As the baby grew, Dorbert started having terrible pain in her ribs and back, much worse than anything she\u2019d experienced during her pregnancy with Kaiden. She says her obstetrician explained that without cushioning from the amniotic fluid, the baby had a more direct impact on her body.Dorbert says they didn\u2019t have the money to travel out of state to get an abortion. By this time, they\u2019d left their jobs at Publix; she was doing Instacart deliveries, and Lee was working at an insurance company.A few weeks later, at 31 weeks pregnant, she had a regular visit with her longtime family physician, Dr. David Berger.She told him about how carrying a baby she knew would die had taken a terrible toll.\u201cI just got very depressed, and the anxiety was horrible. I just didn\u2019t want to get out of bed most days. I would just break down crying,\u201d Dorbert told CNN. \u201c[I] just didn\u2019t want to do anything but sit on the couch and cry.Maternity units are closing across America, forcing expectant mothers to hit the road\u201cI continued to feel this baby move,\u201d she added, \u201cknowing that I\u2019m going to give birth and watch my child pass.\u201dHaving to stay pregnant hurt not just her, she said, but also her husband and son.\u201cI really stepped back as a mom because I struggled,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s a 4-year-old boy, he wants to have fun, he wants to play, and he wants his mother to play with him.\u201d But instead, she told Kaiden to watch TV as she lay on the couch.Lee Dorbert said it was \u201cpainful for me to watch\u201d his wife suffer, as there was \u201cnothing I could really do besides just being there for her.\u201dFurious about what his patient was experiencing, with Deborah\u2019s permission, Berger published videos onand TikTok onand more TikTok videos onand.\u201cThis brings me so much sorrow to see that a couple \u2013 or anybody \u2013 would have to go through something like this. In all honesty, it makes me embarrassed to be a Floridian,\u201d Berger said in the YouTube video.Viewers offered the Dorberts money to travel out of state to terminate the pregnancy. But the couple worried that they would get arrested.Florida law doesn\u2019t forbid such travel, but the Dorberts were concerned.\u201cThe thing that scared us [was] we didn\u2019t know if we\u2019d go to jail. We didn\u2019t know if we\u2019d be fined. We still had another son. We couldn\u2019t have anything happen to us, because we have another child,\u201d Deborah said.As the weeks passed, Kaiden watched his mother\u2019s belly grow. At first somewhat indifferent to having a sibling, he began to warm up to the idea.\u201cAs we continued to see my belly grow, he knew there was a baby in there,\u201d she said. As he saw and felt the baby move, \u201che was getting excited. He\u2019s like, \u2018there\u2019s a baby in your tummy!\u2019 \u201dKaiden was so looking forward to meeting his little sister \u2013 they didn\u2019t know the sex at the time, but he assumed it would be a girl \u2013 that he urged his mother to \u201cjust spit the baby out.\u201d In his mind, he and the baby were already a team, and so when his parents urged him to pick up his toys or eat his vegetables or take a bath, he would say, \u201cmy sister told me I don\u2019t have to do that.\u201dUnsure of what to tell Kaiden, the Dorberts consulted a therapist and decided it would easier on their son if they waited until just before the baby was born to let him know his sibling wasn\u2019t coming home.On February 18, a few weeks before she delivered, thepublished a story about the Dorberts.Deborah said it elicited one \u201chateful\u201d letter, but she took some comfort from many \u201cheartwarming\u201d emails the Washington Post reporter forwarded her from readers who sent \u201ctheir love and kindness.\u201dOnce she got to 37 weeks, Dorbert\u2019s obstetrician told her they could induce labor. The night before delivery, they told Kaiden that the baby had died, and he broke down crying.The next day, after birth, Milo \u201clooked more on the blue side. He gasped for air, and you could tell he was really trying hard to breathe,\u201d Dorbert remembers.His parents and Deborah\u2019s parents cuddled him for 94 minutes before he took his last breath.They were \u201cmaking sure he felt loved, and he wasn\u2019t in pain, even though I knew he was in pain,\u201d Deborah said.Lee sang to Milo \u201cThree Little Birds\u201d by Bob Marley & The Wailers and read him the book \u201cI\u2019ll Love You Forever\u201d about a polar bear cub \u2013 Kaiden\u2019s favorite story.\u201cHe didn\u2019t open his eyes at all when we held him, and he passed away in my arms,\u201d Deborah said.Milo\u2019s tiny hand- and footprints were taken and memorialized inside the front cover of the book.She said she knows it would have been emotionally wrenching if the pregnancy had been terminated when her baby\u2019s birth defect was first spotted, at 24 weeks. But being forced to carry the baby for 13 more weeks, knowing that he would die, made it even more horrific.Those 13 weeks are what led to the anxiety and depression and debilitating back pain, she said, making it harder on her, Lee and Kaiden.  It was during those 13 weeks that Kaiden got so excited to have a new sibling, only to have that joy taken away.every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.She still suffers emotionally and physically from those 13 weeks, and it took a toll on her marriage.She and Lee are now in marriage counseling. \u201cWe\u2019re making small steps, but it\u2019s going to take time,\u201d she said.Deborah is angry at the politicians whom she blames for forcing them to experience those gut-wrenching 13 weeks.\u201cI think they need to leave it up to the doctors to treat each and every one of their patients the way they need to be treated,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t think politicians have a place [in] health care. That\u2019s why we have doctors.\u201dHer physicians have reassured her that she\u2019s not at higher risk of having another child with Potter syndrome. Her husband and son want another child, Deborah said, but at this point, she doesn\u2019t.\u201cI can\u2019t go through another trauma like this pregnancy,\u201d she said. \u201cI felt the baby the whole time.\u201dCNN\u2019s Kyla Russell contributed to this report."

        "link": "https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/05/health/cdc-covid-19-data-changes/index.html",
        "text": "When the USMay 11, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will have to change some of the ways it tracks Covid-19 in the United States, but the agency says it won\u2019t lose its sightlines on the infection as it continues to be part of American life.On Thursday, for the first time in three years, the CDC will stop posting a national count of Covid-19 cases. The agency\u2019s color-coded maps of county-level transmission and disease burden will be retired, the CDC will no longer track variants down to the state level, and it will update its genomic surveillance estimates every two weeks instead of weekly.\u201cThough our data going forward will be different, they will continue to provide timely insights for CDC, for local health officials, as well as for the public to understand Covid-19 dynamics,\u201d CDC Principal Deputy Director Dr. Nirav Shah said.\u201cIn short, we will still be able to tell that it\u2019s snowing, even though we\u2019re no longer counting every snowflake.\u201dWHO says Covid-19 is no longer a global health emergencyInstead of following Covid-19 cases, the agency will track the burden and spread of disease primarily through hospitalizations and deaths.The move to stop posting a national case count is largely symbolic. The number of Covid-19 cases known to public health officials has long been undercounted. The percent of detected cases has only fallen further as people have turned to rapid home testing for a diagnosis. At some points in the pandemic, experts estimated that the true number of cases wasthan official counts.Other metrics that people are used to seeing on the CDC\u2019s Covid Data Tracker are also going to go away. As CNN, the CDC will stop publishing detailed, color-coded Covid-19 Transmission Levels and Covid-19 Community Level maps that have been tied to recommendations about when to wear masks, when it\u2019s a good idea for people to test to prevent the spread of disease and when to avoid large indoor public gatherings.When the public health emergency ends, more states are expected to stop reporting Covid-19 cases to CDC. Iowa, for example,. So the CDC says it won\u2019t be feasible to maintain a national count or update its maps.Covid-19 was the fourth leading cause of death in 2022, CDC data showsFuture recommendations for precautions like masking will instead be tied to hospitalization levels.Covid-19 will retain its designation as a nationally notifiable disease, but that\u2019s just a recommendation, says Dr. Brendan Jackson, who leads the CDC\u2019s Covid-19 response. It doesn\u2019t carry any authority for required reporting.  When the public health emergency ends, it will be a state-by-state decision whether to share those numbers, Jackson said Thursday.The CDC says it will still publish the case counts it gets from states, but that will be in a different section of its website, and the numbers won\u2019t be totaled.Some experts say they\u2019re disappointed to see that the CDC will have to go back to an older, fragmented system of having to ask states to share data.\u201cWe\u2019re kind of reverting back to a system where the CDC kind of independently negotiates all these data sharing agreements with the states and they make it more voluntary,\u201d said Beth Blauer, associate vice provost for public sector innovation at Johns Hopkins University.\u201cI think having the states do this all independently doesn\u2019t make a ton of sense because it doesn\u2019t help us understand, in the aggregate, the impact that disease is having on our communities,\u201d Blauer said.She also said it will be very difficult to scale this system back up should another large, immediate public health threat emerge.Starting next week, vaccination counts will become discretionary. Jackson said that most, but not all, of the 64 jurisdictions that report to the CDC have signed data use agreements to share their vaccine administration numbers.  They may not share as much as they have in the past about who is getting vaccinated or do it as frequently, which may limit the nation\u2019s ability to spot widespread racial, ethnic or socioeconomic disparities for future vaccination campaigns.  Starting in June, the CDC says, it will update its vaccination data on a monthly basis.Laboratories will no longer be required to send testing data to the CDC, which will hamper the ability to understand test positivity rates, a metric that, early in the pandemic, helped public health officials know whether they were doing enough testing or if transmission in a community was going up or down.  Positivity rates were used in the transmission maps but also for the CDC\u2019s tracking of variants.The CDC will still get some lab testing data from another system called the National Respiratory and Enteric Virus Surveillance System, a network of about 450 labs that help it track illnesses like influenza and respiratory syncytial virus, or RSV.Variant tracking will continue, but the CDC will have to adjust some of the metrics it uses to model variant proportions.  State-level estimates of variant proportions with go away, but regional levels will remain.  Those will be updated twice a month going forward instead of weekly, as they are now.Covid-19 is a leading cause of death for children in the US, despite relatively low mortality rateThe way the CDC will collect data on deaths will change, too. Instead of scraping numbers from state website and getting direct reports from states, which counted deaths based on the date they were reported, the CDC will switch to a national system that counts deaths based on death certificate data. The agency says this system has become much more timely and will be a more stable way to count Covid-19 deaths going forward. It will also add a new metric to its death reporting: the percentage of all deaths reported that week that are caused by Covid-19.Hospitals will still have to report Covid-19 data through April 2024, but they won\u2019t track as many metrics or submit that information as frequently.  Hospitals have shared information daily through most of the pandemic, but now that reporting will be weekly.Hospitalizations and deaths are known as lagging indicators because they increase only after people have gotten sick. Studies released Friday from CDC epidemiologists show that hospitalizations may not lag behind cases as much as we once thought they did.The, published in the CDC\u2019s Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, show that Covid-19 hospitalizations lagged one day behind increases in reported cases and four days behind increases in emergency room visits.The research also shows that the new system the CDC will be using to track deaths will show trends 13 days earlier than data collected from states, the system that\u2019s being discontinued.With case levels low across most of the country, the need for these kinds of insights has gone away, or scientists have found other ways to get the information, such as testing of wastewater, which begins to increase about a week before testing data reflects an uptick in spread. Wastewater testing is available in some places, but not all areas have this capability.The CDC will also maintain traveler surveillance, testingin an effort to spot new incoming threats.The CDC will also maintain what it calls sentinel systems: smaller, but nationally representative networks of hospitals and laboratories that will feed in more detailed data. This is much the same way the agency tracks patterns in other respiratory diseases, such as the flu and RSV.  The CDC says recent investments in these sentinel systems will help it maintain eyes on Covid-19.every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.Instead, it will be using hospitalizations and emergency room visits as the primary ways it tracks Covid-19 and as the basis for its recommendations. When hospitalization rates in an area are high, for example, it will be recommending that people wear masks, said Jackson.CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky acknowledged some of these data changes in a Senate committee hearing this week, although she emphasized that the CDC was not \u201cchanging the steam\u201d of its work on Covid-19.\u201cAs the public health emergency is set to end next week, I do want to just reiterate that we at CDC are not changing the steam at which we are working through resolving this public health emergency,\u201d Walensky said at a hearing of the Senate Committee on Health Education, Labor and Pensions.\u201cIt is the case at the end of the public health emergency, we will have less window as to the data,\u201d she said. \u201cWe won\u2019t get laboratory reporting. We won\u2019t get case reporting. So we\u2019ll lose some of that.\u201d"

        "link": "https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/02/health/murthy-loneliness-isolation/index.html",
        "text": "US Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy released an advisory Tuesday addressing the \u201cepidemic of loneliness and isolation\u201d affecting the country and laying out a framework for a \u201cNational Strategy to Advance Social Connection.\u201dThe advisory is part of the Biden administration\u2019s broader efforts to address mental health, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Monday.Strong, steady friendships may be an asset to your physiological health, study shows\u201cIn recent years, about one-in-two adults in America reported experiencing loneliness,\u201d Murthy says in the advisory. \u201cAnd that was before the COVID-19 pandemic cut off so many of us from friends, loved ones, and support systems.\u201dResearch has showed that loneliness and isolationto sleep problems, inflammation and immune changes in younger adults. In older people, they\u2019re tied to symptoms such as pain, insomnia, depression, anxiety and shorter life span. In people of all ages, they may be associated with higher risks of heart disease, stroke, diabetes, addiction, suicidality and self-harm, and dementia.But social connection can help, Murthy\u2019s office said in a statement, serving as a buffer to health problems while making communities more resilient.\u201cLoneliness I think of as a great masquerader. It can look like different things,\u201d Murthy told CNN\u2019s Erin Burnett on Monday. \u201cSome people, they become withdrawn. Others become irritable and angry. \u2026 I think the time you get concerned is when you start experiencing a feeling of loneliness for prolonged periods of time. If you feel lonely, you pick up the phone and call a friend, and then it goes away, or you get in the car and go see a family member, that\u2019s OK. That\u2019s loneliness acting like hunger or thirst, a signal our body sends us when we need something for survival. It\u2019s when it persists that it becomes harmful.\u201dThe important reason why young people need to make more phone callsSocial connection is as essential to humanity as food, water or shelter, the advisory says. Humans have historically needed to rely on each other for survival, and modern people remain wired for that connection and for proximity to others.\u201cGiven the profound consequences of loneliness and isolation, we have an opportunity, and an obligation, to make the same investments in addressing social connection that we have made in addressing tobacco use, obesity, and the addiction crisis,\u201d Murthy says in his advisory. \u201cWe are called to build a movement to mend the social fabric of our nation. It will take all of us \u2013 individuals and families, schools and workplaces, health care and public health systems, technology companies, governments, faith organizations, and communities \u2013 working together to destigmatize loneliness and change our cultural and policy response to it.\u201dThe framework is rooted in six pillars.The first, strengthening social infrastructure in communities, involves boosting programs like volunteer organizations or religious groups, policies like public transit or education, and physical elements like libraries and green spaces.Why most men don't have enough close friends\u201cInvesting in local communities and in social infrastructure will fall short if access to benefits is limited only to some groups,\u201d the advisory notes. \u201cEquitable access to social infrastructure for all groups, including those most at-risk for social disconnection, is foundational to building a connected national and global community.\u201dThe second pillar calls for more \u201cpro-connection public policies.\u201d Governments and institutions are urged to adopt an approach that recognizes that policies can benefit or hinder connection and that \u201cevery sector of society is relevant to social connection.\u201d Policymakers should focus on reducing disparities in connection.The third pillar relies on the crucial role of public health and health care delivery systems to address social connection. Murthy calls for increased investment in educating health care providers about the physical and mental benefits of social connection and the risks of disconnection. Patients\u2019 needs should be assessed and supported, and organizations should track prevalence of disconnection in communities and advance local solutions, he says.For the fourth pillar, reforming digital environments, Murthy singles out the \u201ctangible impact\u201d of technology on Americans\u2019 daily lives and connections. \u201cTechnology can also distract us and occupy our mental bandwidth, make us feel worse about ourselves and our relationships, and diminish our ability to connect with others. Some technology fans the flames of marginalization and discrimination, bullying, and other forms of severe social negativity.\u201dFirst on CNN: Most people feel socially connected as Covid-19 precautions ease, but many still need support, survey findsThe framework calls for more data transparency from tech firms, as well as the establishment and implementation of safety standards such as age-related protections. It also encourages development of \u201cpro-connection technology to promote healthy social connection, create safe environments for discourse, and safeguard the well-being of users.\u201dThe fifth pillar, deepening knowledge, urges stakeholders such as officials, policymakers, health care providers and researchers to collaborate on a research agenda to address gaps in the data. \u201cConsistent measurement will be critical to better understanding the driving forces of connection and disconnection, and how we can be more effective and efficient in addressing these states.\u201dThe final pillar urges a culture of connection in which Americans \u201ccultivate values of kindness, respect, service, and commitment to one another.\u201d Everyone can use their voice to emphasize these values and model healthy connections, Murthy says, and the nation\u2019s institutions should invest in demonstrating them.The advisory concludes with suggestions about how specific groups \u2013 including governments, health organizations, schools, workplaces and individuals \u2013 can help advance social connection.every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.Parents and caregivers have an especially powerful role, the advisory says. They can model healthy connection by spending time together, setting aside time for screen-free socializing, and engaging in constructive conflict resolution. They\u2019re also urged to encourage individual friendships and group activities, to be aware of how young people spend their time online and to watch for potential warning signs of loneliness or isolation.Individual Americans might take time out of each day to connect with a friend or family member and minimize distractions during conversations. Regularly practicing service and gratitude can encourage others to do the same. Cut back on things that lead to disconnection, such as harmful social media use or time spent in unhealthy relationships. Be open with health care providers about significant social changes that may affect levels of connection, and reach out to a loved one, counselor, provider or crisis hotline in times of struggle."

Pictures, Gosling said that \u201cup until this point, I only knew Ken from afar. I didn\u2019t know Ken from within.\u201d\u201cI doubted my Ken-ergy. I didn\u2019t see it,\u201d he said, later adding that his co-starand director Greta Gerwig ultimately \u201cconjured\u201d the Ken doll out of him.Upon landing the role, Gosling underwent a physical transformation that is still being showcased with his frosty bleached-blonde hair and uber-bronzed skin to embody the plastic mind of Ken.\u201cI was living my life and the next thing I knew, I was bleaching my hair and shaving my legs and rollerblading on Venice Beach,\u201d Gosling joked.He added that he\u2019d often find himself asking why there was self-tanner on his bed sheets and likened this transformation to being overtaken by what he called \u201cpink fever,\u201d as if he had been sweating Barbie through his pores.As far as Gerwig and Noah Baumbach, her partner and \u201cBarbie\u201d co-writer, were concerned, there was nobody else they felt more suited for the role than Gosling, despite his initial trepidation. Gerwig told the CinemaCon audience that while they were writing the script, they went so far as to write Gosling\u2019s name in for Ken as if they\u2019d already cast him in their minds without knowing him.Gosling certainly showed support for his director, as he attended the panel wearing a pink jacket over a white t-shirt with text in the signature Barbie font that read \u201cGreta Gerwig.\u201dRobbie, who plays Barbie in the film, said during the panel that walking onto the set of the project was \u201clike a dopamine hit\u201d every day.

        "text": "In hindsight, the most unlikely hit among Marvel\u2019s parade of them was all about the unlikeliest of families. \u201cGuardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3\u201d drives home that point, with a boisterous and often emotional sequel that feels very much like a true conclusion, fueled in no small part by writer-director James Gunn having migrated his talents.Building franchises around more obscure heroes always represented the biggest risk in Marvel\u2019s cinematic plans, which made the success of \u201cGuardians\u201d in 2014 and itsa minor miracle. As evidence look no further thananother super-team that (while meriting an asterisk due to the pandemic) didn\u2019t fare nearly as well.The key to Gunn\u2019s earlier movies relied on a mix of abundant visual energy, distinctive characters, cleverly incorporated songs and no small amount of sheer goofiness. All of that is on full display in \u201cVol. 3,\u201d as well as a darker thread that delves heavily into the past of Rocket (voiced by Bradley Cooper), the unnaturally savvy and bloodthirsty anthropomorphic raccoon, conveying an unexpectedly poignant animal-rights message in the process.This \u201cGuardians\u201d begins with Quill (Chris Pratt) having become an emotional wreck because of his estrangement from Gamora (Zoe Salda\u00f1a), who returned post-blip with no memory of their relationship. He\u2019s jolted from his misery, however, by a threat that forces the team to leap into action to save one of their own, which includes facing off against one of the more visually striking comics characters, Adam Warlock (Will Poulter), a creature with enormous power but an almost-childlike mind.Reinforcing the sense of the movie serving as an extended curtain call, Gunn \u2013 who, remember, was fired from the project over social-media posts, and\u2013 repeatedly highlights the depth of the bond between key players, in a way that perhaps more than anything brings to mind \u201cToy Story 3.\u201d Yet \u201cGuardians\u201d also revels in broadly comic exchanges between the hulking Drax (Dave Bautista), empath Mantis (Pom Klementieff) and serious Nebula (Karen Gillan), often approximating the banter of squabbling siblings.That playfulness \u2013 recently illustrated by the\u2013 extends to the seemingly unlimited song budget, which has moved beyond Quill clinging to his childhood to setting an overall mood of warmth and nostalgia.Other than being a bit too busy, and a little too long, the main quibbles would be somewhat underusing Warlock and the generic nature of the principal bad guy, a ruthless madman known as the High Evolutionary (Chukwudi Iwuji), although the villains have been a weak link throughout. The closing-credit sequences also fall in the barely-worth-sitting-through category.Still, after some second-guessing about Marvel\u2019s invulnerability thanks to disappointing results (creatively as well as commercially) forand to a lesser degree the \u201cBlack Panther\u201d sequel, \u201cGuardians\u201d feels like a return to form on both fronts. And if it does close the books, at least for a while, on this series, give Gunn credit for bidding a fond farewell with both barrels blazing."

        "link": "https://edition.cnn.com/2023/04/25/entertainment/fatal-attraction-review/index.html",
        "text": "\u201cFatal Attraction\u201d was very much a product of its time, so an attempt to cash in on the title \u2013 as Paramount+ does with a new version \u2013 absolutely needed to reconsider and reimagine the material. Yet the eight-part series awkwardly draped over its bones is a beyond-busy murder mystery, one that \u2013 with apologies to one of the film\u2019s signature lines \u2013 can easily be ignored.As it happens, \u201cFatal Attraction\u201d arrives the same week another streaming show with a very similar framework, \u201cSaint X,\u201d makes its debut on Hulu. Both jump around in time, hinge on the mysterious death of a young woman and build, too slowly, toward revealing what really happened, relying on an abundance of twists to tease out the story.The former starts with one of the most popular movies of the late 1980s, which famously scared men about infidelity thanks to Glenn Close\u2019s alluring and then obsessed and increasingly dangerous stalker, mixing eroticism, horror and no small amount of sexism, with a memorable pinch of animal cruelty for good measure.The series updates that artifact in a number of ways \u2013 a few of them logical, one (yes) having to do with a bunny, but most merely perplexing. Specifically, it begins with Dan Gallagher (Joshua Jackson), a Los Angeles prosecutor, doing time for the murder of Alex Forrest (Lizzy Caplan), a co-worker with whom he had engaged in a steamy affair before things went very, very sideways.Relying primarily on hairstyles to designate the 15-year gap as it oscillates between then and now, the show begins with Dan being passed over for a promotion \u2013 he thinks he\u2019s a lock to become a judge \u2013 which, as constructed, puts him in the mindset to risk his life with his wife, Beth (Amanda Peet), and their young daughter Ellen (Vivien Lyra Blair, recently seen in) by stepping out with Alex when the two are away.Flash forward, and Dan is just getting out of prison, said daughter is now a young woman (played at that age by Alyssa Jirrels) wrestling with her family history, and Beth has moved on. Meanwhile, Dan and his pal Mike (Toby Huss) seek to reopen their investigation, trying to determine what really happened to Alex and potentially clear his name.Executive producer Alexandra Cunningham (\u201cDirty John\u201d) capitalizes on the more-expansive format to flesh out a lot of details, more organically developing the relationship and Alex\u2019s side of the story as well as her past. The series also still weaves in touches that defined the movie, from Alex and Dan\u2019s trysts to her famous warning, \u201cI\u2019m not going to be.\u201dStill, the understandable attempt to bring \u201cFatal Attraction\u201d into the 2020s \u2013 as Paramount recently did, more successfully, with\u2013 feels more tortured than most reboots (see the recentas another example), padding on new characters and improbable wrinkles.Perhaps foremost, it takes what feels like an awfully long time to get to the not-terribly-satisfying payoff, despite solid work by Jackson and Caplan, who were both better served by the erotic series \u201cThe Affair\u201d and \u201cMasters of Sex,\u201d respectively.In the original, Alex told Dan as the sexual tension built between them, \u201cYou\u2019re here with a strange girl being a naughty boy.\u201d There\u2019s still some naughtiness in this incarnation, but it\u2019s more guilty of being a boring boy than anything else.The same criticisms largely apply to \u201cSaint X,\u201d an adaptation of Alexis Schaitkin\u2019s novel, which begins with the promising premise of how a \u201cmissing White woman\u201d story unfolded, reflectingwith such tales and the toll on those swept up in its orbit.Specifically, that includes guests and staff at the Caribbean resort where college-student Alison (West Duchovny, David Duchovny and T\u00e9a Leoni\u2019s daughter) went missing, and particularly the lingering effects on her much-younger sister, Emily, who as an adult (played by \u201cFear the Walking Dead\u2019s\u201d Alicia Debnam-Carey) begins nosing around for answers as to what really transpired.Loosely inspired by the, the issues of class and race \u2013 illustrated through the prism of two hotel employees, well played by Josh Bonzie and Jayden Elijah \u2013 feel overwhelmed here by the emphasis on Emily\u2019s ill-advised attempt to play Nancy Drew; Alison\u2019s \u201cstupid tourist\u201d behavior, despite her protestations to the contrary; and an ending that doesn\u2019t justify the trip.Complaining that such mystery series meander too much has become a familiar gripe, but that doesn\u2019t make it any less true. Like\u201cSaint X\u201d sets up provocative upstairs/downstairs themes in an inviting location, but unlike that HBO show, it\u2019s a relatively poor destination for an eight-episode stay."

        "text": "With the premiere of HBO\u2019s \u201c,\u201d the Watergate scandal is having yet another moment, 51 years after the original break-in that ultimately led to Richard Nixon\u2019s resignation.Watching some of the newer and more recent productions devoted to that story, as well as revisiting older ones, offers a few insights about tho Watergate years, and a reminder that Nixon\u2019s scandals went well beyond just sendinginto the Democratic National Committee headquarters.For those who might see Watergate as ancient history, these projects \u2013 featuring those who participated in and covered the story \u2013 also underscore that this previous constitutional threat was much closer than it appears in the rear-view mirror.As for refresher courses, here are a few options, including some that qualify as Watergate-adjacent in terms of helping to understand or remember what happened.Watergate meets \u201cVeep\u201d in this new limited series, an at-times-surreal account that occasionally feels a little too over the top, mostly because the real-life characters actually were. At its best, it\u2019s a lightweight companion to \u201cAll the President\u2019s Men,\u201d presenting the flip side of all that planning and frantic covering up by what amounted to Keystone Criminals. (CNN and HBO Max are both part of the same parent company, Warner Bros. Discovery.)Although Washington Post reportersare among those interviewed, there\u2019s a bit more of a skew in this documentary toward CBS\u2019 role as one of the few TV news outlets to cover the scandal, including Lesley Stahl\u2019s recollections about the story, footage of Walter Cronkite weighing in on the scandal and stately reporter Daniel Schorr discovering on air that he had earned a spot on Nixon\u2019s enemies list as he read through the names.Incorporating interviews old and new, the project also captures just what a huge \u201chit\u201d the televised Watergate hearings were, back in the days when there were three networks and not a whole lot of viewing alternatives.A four-part docuseries that played on CNN, the project features interviews with John Dean, among others.The History Channel\u2019s exhaustive six-part docuseries, which originally premiered in 2018.Thisof Watergate is worth catching for those who haven\u2019t seen it, with Julia Roberts as whistleblower Martha Mitchell, an unrecognizable Sean Penn as her husband, Nixon Attorney General John Mitchell, and Dan Stevens as John Dean. Exaggerated in part to the point of satire, it\u2019s nevertheless a telling look at the scandal and its key players, including a wildly over-the-top Shea Whigham as G. Gordon Liddy.A rewatch of director Alan J. Pakula\u2019s 1976 film version of Woodward and Bernstein\u2019s book stands out for unintended reasons in certain places, such as a Washington Post editors meeting that consists entirely of older White guys in white shirts, debating whether to stand by the young reporters.At its core, though, the film holds up and then some, from its exploration of classic shoe-leather reporting to the scared sources unable to stay silent about the corruption they witnessed. Add to that the sensational performances and William Goldman\u2019s Oscar-winning screenplay, with signature lines like Deep Throat (Hal Holbrook) telling Woodward (Robert Redford) to \u201cFollow the money\u201d and \u201cThe truth is, these are not very bright guys, and things got out of hand.\u201dSteven Spielberg\u2019soffers a deeper dive into another angle of the story, specifically the relationship between Washington Post editor(Tom Hanks) and publisher(Meryl Streep), and the courage the latter exhibited \u2013 having been thrust into that role \u2013 in withstanding pressure from the White House when publishingin 1971. That tenacity would later be vital to the Post\u2019s role in exposing Watergate.Thisstars a better-than-the-movie Liam Neeson as Felt, the FBI official, Deep Throat, in 2005.For an entirely different take, this zany 1999 caper stars Kirsten Dunst and Michelle Williams two unwitting high schoolers who wander off during a White House tour and find themselves embroiled in the scandal of the century. Dan Hedaya features as \u201cDick\u201d Nixon, with Will Ferrell as Bob Woodward.Michael Sheen and Frank Langella reprised their stage roles as David Frost and Nixon in conducting their famous 1977 TV interviews, an entertaining movie, defined by its standout performances, that\u2019s as much about the pressure on the interviewer and their verbal parrying as his subject."

At its best, it\u2019s a lightweight companion to \u201cAll the President\u2019s Men,\u201d presenting the flip side of all that planning and frantic covering up by what amounted to Keystone Criminals.Woody Harrelson and Justin Theroux portray E. Howard Hunt and, the two minor players in the bigger scheme of things that masterminded the plot. The pair sought to ingratiate themselves to the Nixon administration with a bag of \u201cdirty tricks\u201d to help ensure his reelection, leading to Watergate and breaking into the office of Vietnam whistleblower Daniel Ellsberg\u2019s psychologist.If Hunt, a father of three, was leading a life of quiet desperation when this opportunity reared its head, Liddy represented the sort of gung-ho true believer convinced the end \u2013 which is to say, \u201cSaving the country from Communism\u201d \u2013 justifies any means, and that the ultimate goal is \u201cproximity to power.\u201dHigh-ranking White House officials, meanwhile, including John Dean (Domhnall Gleeson) and Attorney General John Mitchell (John Carroll Lynch), were understandably skeptical at first, but eventually gave the greenlight to some of the clandestine operations. Yet as Hunt and Liddy descended deeper into the abyss, they kept hitting absurd snags, while prompting Hunt\u2019s wife (\u201cGame of Thrones\u2019\u201d Lena Headey) to distrust Liddy, who plays recordings of Hitler speeches and keeps offering to do that thing where he holds his hand over a burning flame.\u201cThe sooner you\u2019re done with this guy the better,\u201d she tells Hunt, who shares those sentiments about half the time, while going along with Liddy the rest.Directed by \u201cVeep\u201d producer David Mandel from a script by Alex Gregory and Peter Huyck, \u201cWhite House Plumbers\u201d approaches the material in a satirical manner, and makes some clever and shrewd choices, including a particularly amusing nod to \u201cAll the President\u2019s Men.\u201dEven allowing for the dramatic liberties taken with the facts, the whole exercise sort of rises and falls on Theroux\u2019s cartoonish portrayal of the flamboyant Liddy, which could easily be seen as an absurd exaggeration except for the fact that he really was a beyond-eccentric character, parlaying his association with Watergate into a radio show and acting appearances (it\u2019s noted textually that he guest starred on \u201cMiami Vice\u201d) after his release from prison.At five parts, \u201cWhite House Plumbers\u201d meanders a bit in the buildup to the break-in, luxuriating in the trappings of the period and Hunt\u2019s fractious family life while depicting its principals doing unbelievably stupid things, like bragging to a stewardess about their covert activities. The story gains momentum in its aftermath and the coverup that followed, testing the value of the loyalty to Richard Nixon (seen only in news clips) that Liddy preaches with messianic zeal.Much of the narrative brings to mind the quote attributed to Deep Throat (a.k.a. Mark Felt, played here, briefly, by \u201cVeep\u2019s\u201d Gary Cole) in \u201cAll the President\u2019s Men,\u201d in which he tells Bob Woodward, \u201cThe truth is, these are not very bright guys, and things got out of hand.\u201d\u201cWhite House Plumbers\u201d occasionally feels like it has gotten out of hand too, attributable in part to the stranger-than-fiction aspects of the story. On that level the project works primarily as a companion to a rich trove ofbut like Hunt and Liddy, when held up next to that roster it relatively looks like a minor-league player."

        "text": "\u201cSilo\u201d is an unfortunately apt name for a series that feels as if it\u2019s slowly spinning in circles, set inwhere the lingering remnants of humankind grapple with how they got there and what they do next. Apple TV+ has taken some big sci-fi bets (see), but despite its provocative themes this series inspires a little too much curiosity about when and how to find the exit.\u201cWe do not know who built the silo\u201d and \u201cWe do not know when it will be safe to go outside\u201d are part of the mantra repeated by those living in this confined space, who only know that the domicile was built more than 100 years earlier and that it\u2019s likely certain death if they\u2019re forced to \u201cclean,\u201d or venture outside into what appears to be a forbidding wasteland.Based on the book series by Hugh Howey, the series inspires comparisons to cinematic visions of a world where those in authority aren\u2019t sharing everything with its populace, from \u201cSoylent Green\u201d (was that really a half-century ago?) toanother series (after the movie) boxed in by the parameters of its premise.Adapted by producer Graham Yost (\u201cJustified\u201d), \u201cSilo\u201d boasts an impressive cast, and exhibits a willingness to introduce and then shed major characters.At its core is Juliette (Rebecca Ferguson), a technical genius who keeps the silo\u2019s life-support systems functioning, who begins asking probing and uncomfortable questions after a personal loss involving a mysterious death.Her investigation doesn\u2019t sit well with the bureaucratic figures running the place (Tim Robbins and Common key among them), who clearly know more than they\u2019re sharing with the population in an effort to keep the silo\u2019s residents docile and manageable. That includes rules about who gets to procreate in an effort to sustain and protect this society\u2019s limited resources.While the 10-episode season begins with a fair amount of momentum, featuring Rashida Jones and David Oyelowo at the outset, forward progress pretty quickly slows to a crawl. That does foster suspense about what\u2019s actually outside, but it doesn\u2019t do a whole lot to propel the audience through this season, much less stoke excitement for another.Building this sort of elaborate world takes some time, and the inherent warnings about authoritarianism and blindly trusting the government give the series a certain real-world resonance. (As a footnote, the dystopian backdrop has a close cousin in \u201cBlack Knight,\u201d a South Korean series premiering on Netflix in May, so there\u2019s a lot of that going around.)The inherent mystery here, however, feels stretched to the point of strained, exacerbated by characters that don\u2019t consistently pop. When Common\u2019s smooth-talking security enforcer ominously says, \u201cWe all work for the good of the silo,\u201d for viewers who actually do have the option of going outside, it\u2019s reason to consider how well a plodding exercise like \u201cSilo\u201d really works for the good of us."

        "text": "Setting aside whether the world really needs the equivalent of a \u201cBridgerton Cinematic Universe,\u201d Netflix has taken that predictable plunge witha cleverly constructed prequel to producer\u2019 media darling. Reaching back to the origins of supporting players, the limited series offers additional insight to how this sumptuous society came to be, while showcasing its more mature denizens.Oscillating between two time frames, the six-episode series features its namesake (Golda Rosheuvel) as the matchmaking monarch grousing about her adult children\u2019s failure to produce heirs, flashing back to her assumption of that title as a lass (nicely played by India Amarteifio) when she enters into an arranged marriage to King George (Corey Mylchreest).Charlotte\u2019s initial relief that her husband is rather easy on the eyes (this is \u201cBridgerton,\u201d after all) is soon tempered by his erratic and distant behavior, prompting questions as to what secrets he might be hiding.Young, far from home and faced with this mercurial situation, Charlotte must also grapple with his imperious mother (\u201cGame of Thrones\u2019\u201d Michelle Fairley), who proves reluctant to relinquish any power to the new queen. While she does have a helpful attendant in the young Brimsley (Sam Clemmett), Charlotte fights a battle to assert her own authority and personality, lending credence to the older Queen\u2019s weary lament, \u201cThe life of a royal is lonely.\u201dThe young Charlotte does find a willing and much-needed confidant in Rebecca, a.k.a. Lady Danbury (Arsema Thomas in the past, and again Adjoa Andoh in the present), whose machinations as the savvy, much-younger wife of an ancient husband (Cyril Nri) create a parallel thread that fleshes out her back story. Ruth Gemmell also appears as matriarch Violet Bridgerton, providing another connection to both the original series and how what transpired decades ago informs its present.As for that past, \u201cQueen Charlotte\u201d delves into how the world of Bridgerton came to be, as these young royals must navigate what is definitely not a color-blind society. The series also offers an intriguing window into mental-health issues as filtered through the prism of an age where the language didn\u2019t even exist to intelligently discuss such matters, much less understand them.\u201cBridgerton\u201d flourished as a modernized spin on old costume dramas, a steamier version of \u201cDownton Abbey\u201d and its ilk that embellished all the soapy, class-conscious shenanigans with sex and tasteful nudity. \u201cQueen Charlotte\u201d understandably doesn\u2019t bother trying to reinvent that wheel, but rather seems content to deftly embroider another layer beneath it.Frankly, the level of hoopla surrounding \u201cBridgerton\u201d (which included a first-season Emmy nomination as best drama) felt, and the second season suffered from the losses ofand its Lady Whistledown mystery; still, given the show\u2019s popularity Rhimes has shrewdly tapped its elder contingent, along with fresh new faces, to build on that foundation, aided by Fairley giving them all a run for their money in terms of stiff-upper-lipped devotion to custom and duty.Summing up the show\u2019s unabashed sense of romance falls to the young king\u2019s trusty servant Reynolds (Freddie Dennis), who at one point muses, \u201cGreat love can make miracles.\u201dWhen it comes to achieving TV success, a just-OK show that lands at just the right time occasionally can too."

        "text": "sure went South quickly.While there were plenty of developments around the proposed deal between Waystar Royco and GoJo, as well as political posturing and horsetrading in advance of a presidential election, the heart of the seventh episode of the final season of\u201cSuccession,\u201d \u201cTailgate Party,\u201d resided in the on-again, off-again relationship between Shiv Roy (Sarah Snook) and her estranged husband Tom Wambsgans (Matthew Macfadyen).The hour began with the two enjoying the renewed heat between them, even exchanging naughty texts. Yet if reconciliation seemed to be in the air as they hosted a high-powered event together \u2013 \u201cWe had a little break and we\u2019re back,\u201d Tom said, rehearsing how they\u2019d explain things \u2013 the episode closed with the pair engaging in one of the most brutal verbal spats TV has ever witnessed.Trouble started brewing quickly, beginning with Shiv\u2019s perplexed (and priceless) reaction when Tom gave her a scorpion as a gift. The situation escalated as Shiv squired Matsson (Alexander Skarsg\u00e5rd) around the party, smiling along as he alluded to post-merger changes that would include showing Tom the door.Shiv had been playing an angle, serving as Matsson\u2019s insider and informant as he jockeyed with her brothers, who have sought, awkwardly, to torpedo the deal. Her resolve was tested, however, when Matsson balked at spelling out her role and subsequently admitted that he had been fudging subscriber numbers in India, hoping to hide those discrepancies in the rush of the Waystar acquisition.With both of them already agitated, Tom and Shiv finally unloaded on each other, in what played like the mother of all Emmy-campaign reels for their respective third nominations (Macfadyen):\u201cYou\u2019re a hick,\u201d she told him.\u201cYou\u2019re broken,\u201d he said.\u201cI don\u2019t like you. I don\u2019t even care about you,\u201d she snapped.\u201cIt\u2019s not my fault that you didn\u2019t get his approval,\u201d Tom said, regarding her fraught relationship with her father, before Shiv delivered the final, finishing blow: \u201cYou don\u2019t deserve me. And you never did.\u201dObviously, there was a lot else going on within the hour, from Matsson dismissingas \u201cfailsons\u201d to Gerri (J. Smith-Cameron) threatening Roman (Kieran Culkin) with unleashing the very-private text messages he had sent her in order to secure a favorable financial settlement after the previous week\u2019s bloodbath. Plus, there was the little matter of trying to grease Connor (Alan Ruck) with an ambassadorial post in order to get him to drop out of the presidential race, and Greg (Nicholas Braun), a.k.a. \u201cGary\u201d to Matsson, notifying employees about layoffs via a painfully stiff Zoom call.All of that paled, however, next to the epic Tom-and-Shiv roller-coaster ride. Those scenes played like a gift to \u201cSuccession\u201d fans and Snook and Macfadyen, who, with apologies to that scorpion, put enough sting in their zingers to deserve every accolade that goes with them."

        "name": "In \u2018Bupkis,\u2019 Pete Davidson is the worst part of a series about being Pete Davidson",
        "link": "https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/04/entertainment/bupkis-review/index.html",
        "text": "Givea bit of credit for making himself the least interesting part of a series about being Pete Davidson. Much of that has to do with the all-star cast with which the former \u201cSNL\u201d star has swaddled himself in \u201cBupkis,\u201d a frequently funny and later somewhat tiresome Peacock comedy, which only serves to reinforce the sense the comic\u2019sgenerally remains more interesting than any of his onscreen exploits.Having already played a version of himself in the Peacock movieDavidson certainly doesn\u2019t seem overly concerned about stretching his acting chops. The main appeal here, given the unabashed self-absorption of the exercise, hinges on the casting, with Edie Falco (\u201cThe Sopranos\u201d) and Joe Pesci as his mom and grandpa, plus an assortment of high-profile cameos, from Ray Romano to Jon Stewart to John Mulaney, which conjure the lion\u2019s share of the laughs.Davidson is introduced Google-ing himself, chafing at living in the public eye while residing (uncomfortably at times, as an early sequence demonstrates) with his mom. The idea of Davidson existing in an extended state of adolescence runs throughout the show, prompting his grandpa to gently chide him by saying, \u201cYou run around like a kid and you\u2019re not a kid anymore. You\u2019re a man.\u201dThe title \u201cBupkis\u201d is intended to indicate that viewers aren\u2019t necessarily supposed to take the series at face value, but the sporadic use of biographical photos underscores that the show (produced and written by Davidson, Judah Miller and Dave Sirus under the stewardship of \u201cSNL\u201d patriarch Lorne Michaels) offers snapshots of Davidson\u2019s life, includingand a wedding the young Pete had to attend in its aftermath.The series proves considerably stronger when it leans toward the inconsequential and gleefully crude, relying on the heavy hitters in the cast, or those who just drop by (among them Bobby Cannavale and Steve Buscemi), to carry the load. There\u2019s also some good stuff spoofing Hollywood, as one episode hinges on Davidson getting cast in a J.J. Abrams movie, before the role turns out to be considerably less than he envisioned.Laughing at himself is great to a point, which includes addressing the fact that people seem more interested in who he dates than what he does. By contrast, \u201cBupkis\u201d sags when it zeroes in on Davidson and his substance-abuse issues toward the end, which can\u2019t help but feel as if the show is drifting, perhaps unavoidably, into the almost cliched \u201cA Star is Born\u201d quadrant of celebrity biography.For Davidson, lampooning his image has practically become a full-time job, to the exclusion of demonstrating what else he can do, and Peacock appears quite content to cash in on that. \u201cBupkis\u201d is at times very funny, but when it comes to getting to know more about Pete Davidson, the show\u2019s admirable qualities are more in spite of that than because of it."

All the stories take place at different points of time in the galaxy far, far away.is set between the original film trilogy and the latest sequels. \u201cAndor\u201d is a prequel to \u201cRogue One,\u201d itself a prequel to \u201cA New Hope.\u201d And the forthcoming Disney+ seriestakes place hundreds of years before the Skywalker saga.Worry not, padawans: CNN has laid out a comprehensive timeline of the \u201c\u201d canon so you can follow all of the franchise\u2019s time-jumps without getting lost in space.These details are pulled from the official \u201cStar Wars\u201d resources \u201cUltimate Star Wars\u201d and \u201cStar Wars Character Encyclopedia,\u201d as well as experts from outlets likeand the. Omitted from this timeline are anthology series like \u201cStar Wars Visions.\u201dMany \u201cStar Wars\u201d diehards mark the passage of time in the galaxy by the Battle of Yavin, the fateful fight in \u201cA New Hope\u201d in which the first iteration of the Death Star is destroyed. \u201cThe Phantom Menace\u201d takes place more than 30 years before this battle. But for \u201cStar Wars\u201d fans who are still working out the differences between the Republic, the Rebellion and the Resistance, we\u2019ll measure in plain old Earth time.The Skywalker saga begins! Anakin Skywalker is around 9 years old when we meet him in the first prequel film. Obi-Wan Kenobi is a Padawan to Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jin, who\u2019s obsessed with young Anakin\u2019s off-the-charts midi-chlorian count. Darth Maul, pupil of Sith double agent Senator Palpatine/Darth Sidious, kills Qui-Gon and is cut in half by Obi-Wan (though he appears in animated series and cameos in \u201c\u201d with mechanical spider legs). Anakin also meets the teenage queen of Naboo, Padm\u00e9 Amidala, with whom he falls in love.If Anakin is 9 when we meet him in \u2018The Phantom Menace,\u201d then \u201cAttack of the Clones\u201d takes place around a decade later, according to USA Today. Our hero has grown up into a whiny, troublemaking teenager who tends to break rules (like marrying Padm\u00e9, now a galactic senator) and generally irritate his Jedi Master, Obi-Wan, who loves him like a pesky younger brother. The Republic is starting to crumble under the influence of separatists like Count Dooku, a former Jedi turned Sith, and the Republic makes use of a Clone army to keep the galaxy together (for a short while).This animated series is mostly set between \u201cAttack of the Clones\u201d and \u201cRevenge of the Sith\u201d (during which about three years pass). This series ends at the same time \u201cRevenge of the Sith\u201d does \u2013 fan-favorite heroineleaves the Jedi Order and barely escapes Order 66, the command that turns nearly every clone in the galaxy to Darth Sidious\u2019 side thanks to chips implanted in their skulls.So, that Clone Army? Yeah, it didn\u2019t take long for them to turn on the Jedi \u2013 about three years after \u201cAttack of the Clones,\u201d or as long as it takes Anakin to grow out his hair. In this dark installment, Sidious executes Order 66 and snuffs out almost all living Jedi. Anakin commits to the Dark Side full-time, adopting the moniker of Darth Vader. Padm\u00e9 dies shortly after giving birth to twins, Luke and Leia, who are separated and kept secret from Vader. Palpatine/Sidious is now emperor, and the reign of the Empire begins.Several of Disney\u2019s most recent \u201cStar Wars\u201d series take place in between \u201cRevenge of the Sith\u201d and \u201cA New Hope,\u201d when the Empire runs the galaxy with an iron fist and surviving Jedi live in hiding.This animated series takes place in the immediate aftermath of Order 66, impacting nearly every clone except for the members of therogues whose quirks separate them from the rest of the clones \u2013 one is a tech wiz, another is a hulking strongman, yet another is a young girl. Unlike the rest of the clone army, the chips in their brains malfunctioned so they didn\u2019t blindly start murdering Jedi under Sidious\u2019 command \u2013 and their individuality makes them targets of the Empire.We meet the beloved scoundrel Han Solo as a teen ininitially as an orphan trained to pilfer.surmised that \u201cSolo\u201d must take place about eight or nine years after \u201cRevenge of the Sith,\u201d since Han is a few years older than Luke and Leia, and would have needed time to develop galaxy-wide infamy. We also, crucially, meet Han\u2019s cape-loving frenemy,.About a decade has passed since the: Luke and Leia are around 10 years old; Darth Vader employs Force-sensitive Inquisitors to hunt Obi-Wan; andis floundering on Tatooine. Bail Organa tasks Obi-Wan with recovering Leia, his adopted daughter, and the young princess finally meets the Jedi master she\u2019ll call upon at the beginning of \u201cA New Hope.\u201d This reignites Obi-Wan\u2019s hope in the Skywalker children and the future of the galaxy they\u2019ll inherit.A ragtag team of former Jedi, a Mandalorian native, a rambunctious droid and top-notch pilots make up some of the first members of the fledgling rebellion. Their animated adventures take place about 14 years after the events of the \u201cClone Wars\u201d series, per, and conclude just before \u201cA New Hope\u201d begins.Thisintroduces the \u201cRogue One\u201d rebel Cassian Andor when he was still a nonbeliever. But over the course of the season, set about 14 years after \u201cRevenge of the Sith\u201d and around five years before \u201cRogue One,\u201d per the, we witness Andor\u2019s radicalization as he becomes a leader of the rebellion. We also see Mon Mothma use her position as a wealthy senator to cover her secret funding of the rebellion\u2019s efforts.Thetakes place in the weeks leading up to \u201cA New Hope.\u201d In it, Jyn Erso, whose father was forced by the Empire to develop the Death Star, joins the Rebellion in an effort to retrieve the plans to eventually destroy the Death Star. Along with Cassian Andor, the droid K-2SO and an Imperial pilot turncoat, Jyn dies but successfully sends the plans to the Rebel fleet. \u201cRogue One\u201d ends just moments after Darth Vader boards Princess Leia\u2019s ship and the Alderanean adoptee records her fateful message to Obi-Wan, delivered by R2-D2.The films that started it all, these three are situated smack-dab in the middle of the Skywalker saga, starring Anakin and Padm\u00e9\u2019s kids.Many \u201cStar Wars\u201d fans believe Luke and Leia are around 19 during \u201cA New Hope,\u201d meaning the film takes place nearly two decades after \u201cRevenge of the Sith.\u201d Luke is called to adventure on Tatooine after the droid R2-D2, formerly part of Luke\u2019s late mother\u2019s Naboo crew, transmits a message for Obi-Wan (or Old Ben, as he\u2019s called by Luke and others). Vader defeats Obi-Wan \u2013 or does he? \u2013 and the Rebels destroy the Death Star in the Battle of Yavin.About three years after \u201cA New Hope,\u201d per USA Today, Luke begins his Jedi training on Dagobah with a batty old Yoda. Lando double-crosses Han, who winds up frozen in carbonite. And Luke faces off against Darth Vader, during which he loses a hand and learns that the Sith Lord is, in fact, his father. Yikes!And one year after Luke gets his hand sliced off, Leia and Han escape the clutches of Jabba the Hutt. Yoda, at the ripe age of 900, finally dies. And Vader kills Sidious and redeems himself shortly before dying and earning Luke\u2019s respect. The film ends on the Forest Moon of Endor, where our heroes (and an army of Ewoks) defeat the Empire once and for all.At least two Disney+ series are set in the previously unexplored time period of the post-Empire, pre-First Order galaxy.When we, the New Republic is technically leading the Galaxy after the Empire\u2019s defeat in the Battle of Endor. But we soon learn how lawless much of the galaxy, particularly the Outer Rim, remains. And while the New Republic\u2019s bureaucratic progress moves at a glacial pace, former imperials are forming a new evil superpower \u2013 a fascist government that will eventually become the First Order and take over the galaxy.Thisabout the once-inept bounty hunter flitted back and forth through time, from the period after Boba escaped the Sarlacc pit in \u201cReturn of the Jedi\u201d to Din Jarin\u2019s adventures in \u201cThe Mandalorian.\u201d It\u2019s also in this series that we see Grogu training with Luke and Ahsoka before abandoning his studies to rejoin his adopted dad. Boba, meanwhile, fills the power vacuum left by Jabba the Hutt.The final three films in the Skywalker saga (for now, that is) take place in a tighter period of time than its predecessors: According to USA Today, all of them take place within the same year. That means, within that time, Rey connects with the Force, Kylo Ren becomes Supreme Leader, Darth Sidious returns, the First Order is soundly defeated and Han, LukeLeia die. Phew!About 30 years have passed since the Battle of Endor, per USA Today. Leia, now a general with the Resistance, and Han have a son,, whom many fans believe is not yet 30 years old when we meet him. According to the \u201cStar Wars Character Encyclopedia,\u201d Rey, an enterprising orphan on the desert planet Jakku, is 19, the same age as Luke in \u201cA New Hope.\u201d After she befriends former stormtrooper Finn and discovers her Force sensitivity, she faces Kylo, who kills his father.\u201cThe Last Jedi\u201d begins moments after the end of \u201cThe Force Awakens,\u201d when Rey finds Luke on the island planet Ahch-To and he promptly tosses his lightsaber. He reveals that he took on a teenage Kylo Ren, his nephew, as a tutee. That ended poorly \u2013 Kylo absconded with some of Luke\u2019s other pupils and killed the rest, destroying Luke\u2019s hope in the future of the Jedi. Luke dies at the end of the film, Leia leads a small Rebel cell to safety and Kylo kills Snoke, the series\u2019 villainous MacGuffin, to save Rey.The final chapter of the Skywalker saga sees the surviving Skywalkers die: Leia passes in peace and Kylo sacrifices himself for Rey. Oh, and the clone of Emperor Palpatine () dies, too, or so we\u2019re led to believe. Rey, who\u2019s told by the zombified Sith Lord that she\u2019s a Palpatine, too, adopts the Skywalker moniker.There are a fewin the works. One film covers the dawn of the Jedi and another will tie up the various storylines started in \u201cThe Mandalorian\u201d and \u201cAhsoka,\u201d and Jude Law will star in a mysterious show called \u201cSkeleton Crew.\u201d We have a better idea of what the following films and series entail.Details on this series, set to debut sometime in 2024, are slim, but showrunner Leslye Headland did let slip that the series takes placethe events of \u201cPhantom Menace.\u201d Maybe we\u2019ll see a young, spry Yoda in his late 700s or early 800s?This series, premiering in August, takes place around five years after the end of \u201c,\u201d according to, and stars many live-action versions of characters from \u201cStar Wars Rebels,\u201d like Sabine Wren, Hera Syndulla and Grand Admiral Thrawn. This series, then, is likely set around the same time as \u201cThe Mandalorian.\u201d! Daisy Ridley will reprise her role in an upcoming film that sees her trying to rebuild the Jedi Order about 15 years after \u201cThe Rise of Skywalker,\u201d per. Here\u2019s hoping we see much more of that yellow lightsaber."

        "link": "https://edition.cnn.com/2023/04/14/entertainment/yellowjackets-90s-music/index.html",
        "text": "Of the many dark gifts Showtime\u2019s eerie hit series \u201c\u201d serves up for us, the juiciest this season is by far the music.The show \u2013 which bounces between a troupe ofCanadian wilderness after a plane crash and the survivors\u2019 corresponding adult selves in the present day \u2013 embraces nostalgia, incorporating long-cherished tunes from the tail end of last century, with staples from Tori Amos, early Smashing Pumpkins, Massive Attack, Veruca Salt and much more.In Sunday\u2019s episode of \u201cYellowjackets,\u201d alt-rock queenwill debut a version of the show\u2019s theme song, \u201cNo Return,\u201d and has already released it as a single.One of the most unexpected and successful uses of throwback music came in the first episode of Season 2 last month, when Warren Kole\u2019s Jeff had a moment to himself in the car after an intense tryst with wife Shauna (Melanie Lynskey) \u2013 during which he rocks out hard to Papa Roach\u2019s \u201cLast Resort\u201d (sure, the track actually came out in 2000, but that doesn\u2019t take away from its retro vibe).In an interview with CNN, the show\u2019s music supervisor, Nora Felder, explained that the Papa Roach song selection was scripted, and \u201cserved as a perfect physical outlet for Warren whose anxious feelings were riding high while sitting alone in his garage.\u201dOther standout moments in the script, however, are hers to interpret, and Felder relishes the opportunity to match those moments with the right songs from the period.\u201cI re-immerse myself into the show\u2019s era and spirit of the times as I start to build my playlists for the show,\u201d she said. \u201cThe main thing I try to keep in mind is to just stay true to the story and let it tell me what it might need musically.\u201dCase in point, from the same episode \u2013 the placement of Amos\u2019s signature track \u201cCornflake Girl,\u201d off her groundbreaking 1994 sophomore album \u201cUnder the Pink.\u201dThe song \u2013 which appropriately has the lyric \u201cThings are getting kind of gross\u201d just as teen Shauna (Sophie N\u00e9lisse) is about to ingest something unthinkable \u2013 \u201ccame to mind pretty quickly as a possibility\u201d to Felder.\u201cI felt that Amos\u2019s lyrics could serve as a befitting launchpad for the first episode\u2019s ending \u2013 not only as a reflection of Young Shauna\u2019s state of mind,\u201d she noted, \u201cbut also as a reflection of the past and present moods and mentalities lived out by the other \u2018Yellowjackets\u2019 characters in Season 2.\u201dFelder\u2019s work is challenging, in the sense that there is often an ideal wish-list selection for a song during a certain moment in each script, which then might change either due to something technical or because the needs of the scene evolve during production, as a result of many elements, including the actors\u2019 performances.\u201cEveryone on the team always wants the best song-select possible to enhance the story,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen we get to post (production), the common question that comes up among us during the collaboration process is simply, \u2018Do we think we can beat this?\u2019\u201dDuring that collaborative process, Felder says she doesn\u2019t \u201cbelieve there is an exact roadmap into how to merge songs with any given scene or story.\u201d\u201cI always say, \u2018Let the picture tell you what it needs.\u2019 (Kind of like the Wilderness I guess?)\u201dAnother moment that feels perfectly melded to the music playing is thefrom last week\u2019s second episode, which boasts Radiohead\u2019s \u201cClimbing By The Walls\u201d from their mindblowing 1995 album \u201cOK Computer\u201d on the soundtrack.\u201cThe song seems to refer to those unspeakable monsters that can live in one\u2019s head,\u201d Felder noted, referencing the strange collective hallucinations the group undergoes while cannibalizing one of their own. \u201cI can\u2019t think of a more perfect way to hauntingly accent (that) scene, a.k.a. \u2018the feast.\u2019\u201dTo drive home just how important music is to the specific ambient feel of \u201cYellowjackets,\u201d one need look no further than the super creepyfor the show, which features Florence + The Machine\u2019s exceptional and haunting rendition of No Doubt\u2019s timeless 1995 hit, \u201c\u201d\u201cI\u2019m such a huge fan of \u2018Yellowjackets\u2019 and this era of music, and this song especially had a huge impact on me growing up, so I was thrilled to be asked to interpret it in a \u2018deeply unsettling\u2019 way for show,\u201d band frontwoman Florence Welch said in a statement shared with CNN.\u201cWe tried to really add some horror elements to this iconic song to fit the tone of the show. And as someone who\u2019s first musical love was pop punk and Gwen Stefani, it was a dream job.\u201dOf her collaboration with \u201cYellowjackets,\u201d Morrisette, too, felt inspired by the show.\u201cI see parallels between \u2018Yellowjackets\u2019 and my perspective while songwriting: the sheer intensity, that going for the jugular with no fear around going for the profane,\u201d Morissette said in a statement. \u201cI\u2019ve strived my entire career to support the empowerment of women and sensitives, and see the world through the female lens, and what\u2019s so wonderful about this show is that each character is allowed to be dynamic and complex as opposed to oversimplified, reduced versions of women.

        "text": "So yeah, that cryptic ending to the fourth episode of \u201cBarry\u2019s\u201d final season? As it turns out, a lot can happen in eight years, as the series jumped into a strange, new world.HBO\u2019sdid, indeed, take a giant leap into the future, one that finds Barry (Bill Hader) and his now-partner Sally (Sarah Goldberg) living off the grid in the middle of nowhere, having embraced religion while hiding out in a house surrounded by pastel nothingness.Seemingly bored out of her mind, the only acting Sally now gets to do involves working as a waitress named Emily at the local diner, taking out her hostility on a fellow employee who harbored salacious fantasies about her. As for Barry (a.k.a. Clark), he\u2019s home-schooling their young son, while opening up just enough to begin sharing some stories about his days as a Marine.\u201cBarry\u201d has, but this time-flip at the midway point reflected one of its most daring yet, stranding its main character and the woman who ran away with him in a life of domestic drudgery. Enough time has passed that the awful Marvel-like movie on which Sally was serving as an acting coach has spawned three sequels, as evidenced by a \u201cMegagirls 4\u201d billboard featuring her former student.Still, \u201cBarry\u201d saved what promises to be its most significant wrinkle for the end, offering a path back to reconnect the characters, as acting coach Gene Cousineau (Henry Winkler) emerged after being missing and presumed dead for eight years. Why? Because he got wind of the fact that Warner Bros. (like HBO and CNN, part of Warner Bros. Discovery, so you know, synergy) was working on a movie about his former student Barry Berkman, and as usual found himself unable to resist the siren call of Hollywood.Seeing his name and picture in the newspaper, Barry had an instant and ominous reaction: \u201cI\u2019m gonna have to kill Cousineau.\u201d Which is where things stand, for now.\u201cBarry\u201d hasn\u2019t quite been killing it this season, at least, not as unabashedly as it had in the past. The time jump felt understandably disorienting, especially given the fantasy sequences in which the program has indulged along the way.Those flourishes, however, and especially this latest batch of them, reinforced that there\u2019s nothing quite like this very dark comedy in terms of sheer unpredictability. Barry\u2019s final line thus offered not just an opportunity to go tie up loose ends, but further evidence, if any was needed, that while such narrative gambles are indeed tricky, they\u2019re a fundamental part of this show\u2019s legacy."

And while streaming has clearly siphoned off part of the audience, particularly for more serious films, what we think of as \u201csummer movies\u201d stillhave the potential to rake in cash just like the old days.With that said, at this juncture just ahead of the summer months, behold the list of flicks releasing \u201conly in theaters\u201d that are hoping to do exactly that, in order of release date:What better way to kick off summer than with the gang of Marvel-ous misfits known as the Guardians of the Galaxy? After many delays and back-and-forths with director James Gunn, the franchise-closing third installment of the trilogy is finally here, and it\u2019s said to pack an, according to CNN\u2019s critic Brian Lowry. In addition to the comic antics and the eye-popping visuals, a \u201cGuardians\u201d movie always delivers when it comes to a throwback soundtrack, so get ready.The gang is back for, yes, a tenth time, and while some are content towith how the \u201cFast and Furious\u201d filmmakers come up withfor all these endless sequels, others are here for the cars. This installment, welcoming back franchise regulars Vin Diesel, Jordana Brewster, Tyrese Gibson, Michelle Rodriguez and Ludacris, will welcome Jason Momoa and Academy Award-winners Rita Moreno and Brie Larson into the furious fold. Jason Statham, John Cena and more Oscar-winners Helen Mirren and Charlize Theron also return from previous fast and furious forays.The buzz for this latest Disney live-action \u201creimagining\u201d has beenfor quite awhile as, but those faithful to the Oscar-winning 1989 animated classic have yet to deliver their final verdict. One thing\u2019s for sure though \u2013 droves will likely go and see it, kids in tow, to decide if they want to make this new film part of their world.A sequel to one of the most inventive animated films of the new millennium, this follow-up to 2018\u2019s Oscar-winning \u201cInto the Spider-Verse\u201d has the potential to raise the bar even higher as the story of Miles Morales \u2013 a counterpart to Peter Parker and Spider-Man all his own \u2013 is expanded even further, with Spider-Gwen\u2019s help.After an impressive, franchise-launching first film in 2007 starring Shia Labeouf and Megan Fox, many of the sequels in this film series based on the iconic toys have been rather dense and hard to follow, save for the spirited spinoff \u201c\u201d from 2018 starring Hailee Steinfeld. One only hopes this one, featuring animal-like Transformers known as Maximals, doesn\u2019t run too long, and makes even the tiniest bit of sense.This one just might be the one to beat this summer, with DC bringing its universe of superheroes to an emotional and action-packed crescendo, deftly led by\u2019s super-fast Flash. The movie, previewed for attendees at last month\u2019s CinemaCon, has more that a few incredible reveals up its sleeve that are sure to make waves, with high hopes that \u201cThe Flash\u201d is a mainstay blockbuster throughout much of the season. (CNN and DC are both part of the same parent company, Warner Bros. Discovery.)While a cool summer movie would be anas directed by Wes Anderson, nothing comes close the actual work of the real auteur, who takes on a bit of the sci-fi genre in his latest film \u201cAsteroid City.\u201d Boasting a per-usual incredible and starry cast along with trademark Anderson-esque visual splendor, the film follows stargazers who are visited by aliens in a place in the desert called, you guessed it, Asteroid City. Expect very low-key high jinks to ensue.Directed by the accomplished Tim Story, this trope-busting slasher comedy-horror hybrid looks like it will be a crowd-pleaser and then some, featuring an all-Black cast and hinging on the premise that since they\u2019re all Black, as the tag line says, \u201cWe can\u2019t all die first.\u201d Among many other talents, look for \u201cInsecure\u2019s\u201d Yvonne Orji and \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d alum Jay Pharoah.Fire and water do indeed mix in this original story from Pixar, featuring a world in which the elements must learn to live together in the same crowded urban environment. Featuring the voices of many up-and-coming stars, the hope here is that the allegory for race relations veers more toward subtlety than heavy-handedness.For those truly looking to recreate the nostalgia of summer movies past, look no further than thisfrom Indy (), although for the first time, Steven Spielberg (still an executive producer) passes the director reins to James Mangold (of \u201cLogan\u201d and \u201cFord v. Ferrari\u201d). The film brings back John Rhys-Davies of \u201cRaiders of the Lost Ark\u201d fame, and also welcomes \u201cFleabag\u201d star Phoebe Waller-Bridge and \u201cLogan\u2019s\u201d Boyd Holbrook along for the ride. The bar has been set rather low after the misfire that was \u201cIndiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull\u201d in 2008, so Indiana and co. have nowhere to go but up.This uproarious looking movie takes the girls\u2019 trip idea made famous and successful by movies like \u201cBridesmaids\u201d and \u201c,\u201d this time telling the story from an Asian American perspective, letting a quartet of gifted actresses \u2013 including \u201cEmily in Paris\u201d standout Ashley Park and brilliant Oscar nominee Stephanie Hsu from \u201cEverything Everywhere All at Once\u201d \u2013 have what looks to be the best and wildest time ever.\u2018\u2019 Tom Cruise is back again as Ethan Hunt, faced with yet another impossible task that, somehow, we know he\u2019ll pull off. Let\u2019s just hope the movie isn\u2019t as dense, or as long, as the title.Another one that looks like a surefire hit, everything that comes out about \u201cBarbie\u201d ahead of the film\u2019s release just makes everyone even more excited, including Ryan Gosling\u2019sat CinemaCon. The movie\u2019s tongue-in-plastic-cheek feel surely has much to do with its director and co-writer Greta Gerwig, creator of \u201cLady Bird,\u201d who was clearly an unorthodox but refreshing choice to helm this Mattel-themed excursion.For those who rolled their eyes at the previous entry on \u201cBarbie,\u201d head on over to the theater next door for this very serious film from the very serious Christopher Nolan, who promised attendees at this year\u2019s CinemaCon that the movie \u2013 about the inventor of the atomic bomb \u2013 captures the life and times of \u201cthe most important person who ever lived.\u201d Like I said, serious. Cillian Murphy stars.Not content just to keep updating their animated movies with live-action versions, Disney is also continuing its let\u2019s-turn-our-theme-park-rides-into-movies tradition, after the uber-successful \u201cPirates of the Caribbean\u201d franchise and somewhat less-explosive \u201cJungle Cruise\u201d from 2021.This adaptation follows a 2003 version with Eddie Murphy.For those looking to get their creature feature needs met this summer, look no further than \u201cThe Meg 2,\u201d which will hopefully improve upon the strangely lacklusterfrom 2018 about an insanely large prehistoric shark (read: megalodon) who is back for a second course (along with bristling hero Jason Statham).Surely looking to build on the hype (and big bucks) of the \u201cMario\u201d movie, this flick based on the auto racing game had a little more work cut out for it, as star David Harbour pointed out at CinemaCon when he observed that the game is essentially a racing simulator and that there was no real storyline to work with. Enter Jann Mardenborough, a real-life Gran Turismo player portrayed in the new film by \u201cBeau is Afraid\u201d star Archie Madekwe, whose video game-playing skills landed him a shot to become an actual professional race car driver.Initially meant for streaming platforms, this vehicle will herald the cinematic arrival of DC Studios\u2019 first Latino superhero, played by Xolo Maridue\u00f1a of \u201cCobra Kai\u201d and \u201cParenthood\u201d fame. If theis any indication, the movie looks sure to whisk those dog days of summer doldrums away quite nicely."

Social media transformed society and streaming upended entertainment, ushering in the era of \u201cPeak TV\u201d. The series premieres on CNN on Sundays, May 7 at 9 p.m. ET/PT.The next installment of CNN\u2019s Emmy-winning original series \u201cDecades\u201dand its two-hour premiere covered the groundbreaking television of the \u201cPeak TV\u201d decade.In a challenging task given the truly robust number of outstanding series, the CNN Entertainment team compiled a list of decade-defining scripted shows that best captured the zeitgeist.Read on for a look back at some of the most impactful television of thein order of when each series debuted:One of the decade\u2019s most influential and successful shows came not from a broadcaster or premium channel, but a basic-cable network \u2013 AMC \u2013 launching the zombie drama that inspired plenty of imitators as well as numerous spinoffs. Indeed, afterwith multiple cast changes along the way, the show will live on, perhaps appropriately, inHBO\u2019s big swing at fantasy soared through the entire decade in a manner akin to Daenerys Targaryen (Emilia Clarke) and her dragon doing, well\u2026 you know what they did. \u201cThrones\u201d became one of HBO\u2019sinspiring a resurgence of content in the fantasy genre and breeding a number of \u201cThrones\u201d. Based on George R.R. Martin\u2019s \u201cA Song of Ice and Fire\u201d book series, the weekly release of episodes prompted a return to appointment viewing, and the sprawling budget provided viewers with visually stunning hour-long episodes that felt truly cinematic. \u201cThrones\u201d still had issues \u2013 like theand thatcameo \u2013 and theand nudity at times felt gratuitous, but the ensemble cast led by Clarke, Kit Harington, Lena Headey, Peter Dinklage, Sophie Turner and Maisie Williams swept viewers through an unforgettable eight seasons. (HBO and CNN are both part of Warner Bros. Discovery.)Whendebuted on ABC, it became the first network drama to present a Black female lead since the \u201970s, withas DC fixer Olivia Pope. Creatortold CNN, \u201cI really wanted to make shows that I wanted to watch. I wanted to see shows that represented me, that represented the women I knew, that showed women in various stages of being competitive or angry or dark or joyful. You wanted to see everything.\u201d Because the series appeared on network television\u2019s linear format, the cast was able to interact with their audience of \u201cGladiators\u201d on social media while new episodes aired in real time in a way that enhanced both the viewing experience and expanded the overall buzz of the show. Let\u2019s also not forget about the seven glorious years where we got to watch Tony Goldwyn assert himself as dreamy president Fitzgerald Grant.While it only aired for three seasons, Keegan-Michael Key and Jordan Peele\u2019shad a lasting effect with the sketch comedy\u2019s social commentary and satirization. \u201cKey & Peele\u201d tackled race, stereotypes and the polarizing political climate of the era with thoughtfulness and humor. Presidentby welcoming Key on the dais at the 2015 White House Correspondents\u2019 Dinner to appear as his popular recurring character Luther, Obama\u2019s \u201canger translator.\u201d Like \u201cBroad City\u201d and \u201cPortlandia,\u201d \u201cKey & Peele\u201d originated on the internet before expanding to a linear audience. Both men have since gone on more television and film success, with Peele winning afor \u201cGet Out.\u201dComparisons to \u201cSex and the City\u201d aside, Lena Dunham\u2019s unapologetic ode to being a 20-something New Yorker in the 2010s did more for body positivity and frank conversations about sexuality and \u201cadulting\u201d in the first two seasons than most shows hope to accomplish in their entire runs. \u201c\u201d also veritably launched the careers of two stars we\u2019re more than happy to have around, namely Adam Driver and Allison Williams, who took her oft-disliked Marnie and ran with it in Jordan Peele\u2019s brilliant \u201cGet Out\u201d (see above). Quirky and cringey as the \u201cGirls\u201d sometimes were, the show never strayed from a gritty commitment to the often penny-pinching realities of urban millennial living, and also gave us the wonder that was Shoshanna (Zosia Mamet), the.Jenji Kohan\u2019sshattered tired stereotypes by lifting up stories about women of every age, size, race, sexual orientation and state of mental wellness, with critical commentary of the US justice system. It produced many, including Laverne Cox, Dascha Polanco and, who became the faces of a TV renaissance wherein more substantive stories about women of color were told. Based on Piper Kerman\u2019s memoir of the same name, \u201cOrange\u201d is also one of Netflix\u2019s earliest forays into original content, and among the first to release full seasons at once, making \u201cbinge-watch\u201d the new black.As the fullkicked in after its explosive 2013 series finale, series creator Vince Gilligan satiated viewers\u2019 appetites with \u201cBetter Call Saul.\u201d The legal drama was laden with cartel action and a slew of familiar characters as it followed the misadventures flawed lawyer Jimmy McGill, a.k.a.

The seriesthe past, present and future of the \u201cBreaking Bad\u201d timeline as viewers learned how \u201cSlippin\u2019 Jimmy\u201d evolved into Goodman, a beloved character who first appeared in \u201cBreaking Bad.\u201d With \u201cBreaking Bad,\u201d \u201cBetter Call Saul\u201d and the continuation of Jesse Pinkman\u2019s (Aaron Paul) story in the 2019all appearing within the decade, the 2010s were dominated by Gilligan\u2019s universe.As aspiring actor Dev Shah, Aziz Ansari used his background (and his actual parents playing his parents on the series) to personalize the immigrant experience and make the point that even within varied cultures, many family dynamics and life experiences are shared. \u201cIsn\u2019t it weird, all of us first generation kids, we have these amazing lives all because our parents made these crazy sacrifices. Shouldn\u2019t we find out more? Shouldn\u2019t we at least try to thank them somehow?\u201d Ansari as Dev asks in one episode. With,\u201d he does exactly that.When it comes to \u201cPeak TV,\u201d few titles come close to Netflix\u2019s \u201cStranger Things,\u201d which arguably hasn\u2019t even peaked yet (thatis still coming).

That same mix is mirrored in the impeccable casting, which features Winona Ryder in one of her best roles since coming onto the scene in 1988\u2019s \u201cBeetlejuice,\u201d andas the still-mysterious, Jean Grey-like Eleven.

With Rae\u2019s unapologetic wit, \u201cInsecure\u201d is a celebration of Black female friendship. She kept it real, and audiences responded with devotion and gratitude.Featuring stupendous performances from Sandra Oh and Emmy-winner Jodie Comer, this engrossing series from Phoebe Waller-Bridge \u2013 the genius behind \u201cFleabag\u201d (see below) \u2013 had viewers second and triple-guessing at every turn. \u201cKilling Eve\u201d took the well-trodden spy thriller trope and turned it on its head with a fresh and fiendish female perspective.

        "text": "One day in July 2021, my then 15-year-old daughter Poppy stumbled and fell while walking down some stairs, grazing her knee. It wasn\u2019t a serious wound, but over the weeks it didn\u2019t heal.Around the same time, her wrists and knees became sore; her ankles started rolling when she walked; her hands began shaking; her headaches and stomach aches became more frequent and intensely painful. She was always exhausted.Before her health declined, Poppy had enjoyed horse riding and gymnastics, she\u2019d competed in cross country races and been a fearless goalkeeper for the school hockey team.But within a couple of months, as walking became increasingly difficult, she asked me for a walking stick. We found one that folds up and fits neatly in her school bag.I took Poppy to doctors who conducted tests, but they couldn\u2019t find out what was wrong with her. Then, in October, a breakthrough.A podiatrist who was measuring Poppy for insoles to support her aching feet asked if Poppy could bend her thumb to reach her forearm. She could. Could she pull her little finger back to form a 90-degree angle with the back of her hand? She could do that, too.\u201cHave you heard of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome?\u201d the podiatrist asked me. I hadn\u2019t \u2013 so as soon as I got home, I went looking on the internet.There areof Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS), according to research and advocacy organization. Most types are very rare, and can be diagnosed using genetic tests. However, the genes that cause hypermobile EDS (hEDS) \u2013 the most common form, accounting for about\u2013 are unknown, so diagnosis is based on a. The list includes a hypermobility rating, known as the Beighton Score.Poppy had enough symptoms to qualify for hEDS, and the diagnosis was confirmed by a doctorone year ago, on Christmas Eve. He told us that although we can do our best to alleviate some symptoms, there is no cure.Poppy reacted to the news better than I did. She had known for some time that something was fundamentally wrong. The diagnosis was upsetting but identifying her illness also gave her a sense of relief. I felt shocked and overwhelmed, and I cried for weeks.Reading about EDS was like a dreadful slow reveal.I learned that it\u2019s a genetic disorder that causes the body to make faulty connective tissue, and connective tissue is\u2013 in the tendons, ligaments, skin, heart, digestive system, eyes and gums.Weak connective tissue leads to hypermobility, which may sound like a good thing, but some people with bendy bodies suffer a mind-boggling array of symptoms, including joint dislocations and subluxations (like a mini dislocation, when the joint partially slips out of place), soft stretchy skin, abnormal scarring, poor wound healing, gastrointestinal disorders, chronic pain and fatigue.The severity of symptoms varies wildly. Patients with milder cases can lead relatively normal lives, while others become housebound, and some can\u2019t digest food and must be fed through tubes.What\u2019s more, people with hEDS are prone to other conditions, including POTS (postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome, which makes you dizzy when you stand up) and MCAS (mast cell activation syndrome, which gives you allergy-type symptoms).I learned a lot of new acronyms and they all spelled bad news.I initially thought hEDS was rare, because all forms of EDS are commonly. But within a few weeks, I felt like I was seeing references to hEDS everywhere. Actor, writer and director; actor and presenter; and drag queenlive with it. I deep dived into EDS Twitter and EDS Instagram, while Poppy found it comforting to watch TikTok videos made by teenagers with the condition.I discovered multiple patient groups on Facebook, each with tens of thousands of members, which turned out to be great sources of support. I asked questions (what kind of shoes are best for weak ankles? Which knee braces are easiest to pull on and off?) and kind strangers sent helpful advice. At the same time, scrolling through countless personal stories of pain, despair and shattered dreams made me feel terrified about what might lie ahead.I noticed common themes. Many EDS patients had spent years seeking the correct diagnosis; others felt they\u2019d been neglected and gaslit by doctors.There was also a lot of talk of zebras.Linda Bluestein, a Colorado-based physician who specializes in EDS and other hypermobility conditions, and has hEDS herself, explains why.\u201cI was told in medical school, \u2018when you hear hoofbeats think horses, not zebras,\u2019\u201d she says. Many trainee doctors receive the same advice \u2013 when a patient presents with symptoms, \u201clook for the common thing.\u201d That\u2019s why EDS patients commonly refer to themselves as zebras \u2013 and also use the fabulous collective noun \u201cdazzle.\u201d The name represents rarity and evokes the stripy stretch marks that are a common feature on EDS skin.But if people with hEDS are medical zebras, why am I encountering so many of them?Bluestein says that for many years it was thought that one in 5,000 people had Ehlers-Danlos syndrome.  But she says the limited research that\u2019s been carried out into the prevalence of hEDS suggests the true number of cases is \u201cmuch, much higher\u201d than that.Bluestein points me to a 2019carried out in Wales \u2013 a country of 3.1 million people. An examination of primary care and hospital records from 1990 to 2017 found that one in 500 people there has either hEDS or joint hypermobility syndrome (a similar condition with a slightly different set of symptoms). She says it\u2019s \u201ca good study\u201d but believes it\u2019s still an underestimate. The Ehlers-Danlos Society says more population studies need to be done to give a more accurate view of its incidence elsewhere.But despite this possible prevalence, and how debilitating hypermobility disorders can be, the average time to diagnosis from the onset of symptoms is, according to The Ehlers-Danlos Society.Bluestein has firsthand experience of this. Growing up, she wanted to become a ballet dancer and trained six days a week. When puberty hit, she started experiencing joint pain and migraines, and at 16 had her first orthopedic surgery. She realized she wouldn\u2019t succeed in the ballet world and instead pursued her \u201cback-up plan,\u201d to become a doctor. But despite her career choice, Bluestein only received her hEDS diagnosis when she was 47 \u2013 more than 30 years later.\u201cI told my doctor on numerous occasions, \u2018there is something wrong with me, I don\u2019t heal well, I get injured more easily than other people\u2019,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd he just never, never listened.\u201dWhy, for so many patients, does it take so long to get diagnosed?In 2014 a leading EDS expert, Professor Rodney Grahame, remarked at a conference that \u201cno other disease in the history of modern medicine has been neglected in such a way as Ehlers-Danlos syndrome.\u201dthan men are diagnosed with EDS, which could help to explain the neglect, because the medical profession has aof overlooking health complaints made by women.A 2009, conducted by the European Organisation for Rare Diseases, surveyed 414 families of EDS patients from five countries and found that the average delay to an EDS diagnosis was four years for men \u2013 but 16 years for women.The report states that women with EDS tend to be \u201cdiagnosed later because their pain and hypotonia (poor muscle tone) aren\u2019t considered as physical symptoms but rather as psychological symptoms or common complaints.\u201d\u201cWe tend to get dismissed a lot more easily,\u201d says Bluestein. \u201cPeople jump to the conclusion that we\u2019re histrionic females.\u201dAnxiety is very common in patients with hypermobility issues, says Bluestein, which can cloud the picture. \u201cWhen people with anxiety present to a physician, it can suck all the air out of the room, so that the physician almost can\u2019t see anything else.\u201dThis can ramp up the patient\u2019s anxiety further \u201cbecause people aren\u2019t validating our symptoms, and then we start to doubt ourselves,\u201d she says.What\u2019s more, medicine is divided into silos which creates the \u201cworst possible model\u201d for EDS patients, says Bluestein.She explains that undiagnosed patients might consult a neurologist for their migraines, a rheumatologist for joint pain, a cardiologist for palpitations, a gastroenterologist for digestive issues and a urologist for bladder symptoms. Each doctor focuses on the symptoms that fall within their specialty but doesn\u2019t consider the other ailments. \u201cNowhere along the way does somebody realize that there are certain conditions that could tie all of these things together and explain everything,\u201d says Bluestein.The 2009 rare diseases study found that during the quest for a diagnosis, 58% of EDS patients consulted more than five doctors, and 20% consulted more than 20.The consequences of not getting diagnosed for years can be devastating.Melissa Dickinson, a psychotherapist in Atlanta, Georgia, says she experienced symptoms of a \u201cmystery illness\u201d since childhood. Then in 2013, she \u201cwent on honeymoon to Mexico, relatively healthy, and came back disabled and with a dislocated neck.\u201dWhile on vacation, Dickinsonsays she got food poisoning and was prescribed ciprofloxacin, an antibiotic that can pose ato people with EDS. Instead, she says it triggered significant nerve damage, digestive issues that almost made her go blind because her body wasn\u2019t absorbing nutrients, and put her in a wheelchair.Dickinson, who finally received her hEDS diagnosis in 2014, says taking the wrong medication \u201cwrecked me from head to toe.\u201d Now that she\u2019s receiving treatment, \u201cI can walk with mobility aids, but most of my body has to have constant support to function.\u201dLara Bloom, president and CEO of The Ehlers-Danlos Society, who herself has hEDS, says many patients have \u201cmedicalized PTSD.\u201d\u201cThey have had to stop their careers, they\u2019ve had to drop out of school, their relationships have broken down.\u201d The delay inevitably results in worsening symptoms and a declining quality of life, she says. In worst-case scenarios, patients \u201care dying by suicide, they\u2019re self-harming.\u201dSometimes, the failure to diagnose EDS has led to children being taken away from their parents.In 2010, Americans Rana Tyson and her husband Chad were falsely accused of harming their 4-week-old twin daughters, who had unexplained fractures in their legs.Along with their older sister, the baby girls were taken by state authorities in Texas and sent to live with relatives. \u201cIt was the worst day of my life,\u201d Tyson tells me in a phone call.Five months later, a geneticist identified the twins as having a connective tissue disorder, and they were subsequently diagnosed with EDS and a vitamin D deficiency. The family was reunited but \u201c12 years later, it still hurts,\u201d says Tyson.Bloom says some other parents of children with EDS have been wrongly accused of \u201c\u201d \u2013 a rare form of abuse, formerly known as Munchausen\u2019s syndrome by proxy, in which a parent or care giver deliberately causes symptoms or tries to convince doctors that a healthy child is ill.Ellie Pattison, a 19-year-old student who lives in County Durham, England, suffers from severe digestive issues linked to hEDS.Throughout her childhood, Ellie was repeatedly misdiagnosed as having an eating disorder, she says, while her mother Caroline was accused of FII on three separate occasions. Caroline successfully fought to keep her daughter at home, says Ellie, but the ordeal has left the whole family with \u201can unimaginable amount of trauma.\u201d Ellie says she suffered from PTSD and endured years of horrific nightmares, triggered by living with the fear from a young age that she could be forcibly separated from her family.This underlines why prompt diagnosis is so important, says Bloom. \u201cOur hope and dream is for people to get diagnosed when their symptoms begin.\u201dIn the case of hEDS, a crucial first step is to find out what causes it.Cortney Gensemer, a biomedical scientist in the Norris Lab at the Medical University of South Carolina\u2019s department of Regenerative Medicine and Cell Biology, is trying to solve this mystery. She and research mentor Russell Norris, head of the lab, have been studying athey believe causes hEDS (the results of the study are currently under peer review).Like Poppy, Gensemer was diagnosed with hEDS as a teenager. She says the disease affects every aspect of her work. Looking down a microscope is particularly painful at times \u2013 her neck is unstable because of her hEDS, and she\u2019s had metal screws put into some of her neck vertebrae to fuse them.Norris kitted the lab out with special equipment, including motion sensor doors (standard lab doors are very heavy), adjustable chairs and ergonomic pipettes that are gentle on the hands. \u201cIf I didn\u2019t have all that stuff, I don\u2019t think I\u2019d be able to do it,\u201d says Gensemer.To find a hEDS-causing gene, Gensemer says she and Norris sampled DNA from a large family with cases spanning four generations and looked for a mutation that appears only in relatives who have the disease. They identified a \u201cstrong candidate gene\u201d and inserted it into mice using gene editing tools.Gensemer and Norris found that the hEDS mice had significantly more lax tissues, and floppier tails than regular rodents. \u201cYou can tie a loose knot into the mutant mouse tail. With a normal mouse tail, you can (only) bend it into a circle,\u201d Gensemer says.The gene that Gensemer and Norris found won\u2019t account for all hEDS cases, she says. They believe that eventually multiple genes will be identified, and hEDS may be split into different subtypes. This would help to explain why different patients have different symptoms. Crucially, if genetic information sheds light on how the connective tissue is \u201cmessed up,\u201d it could lead to effective treatments, says Gensemer.The Ehlers-Danlos Society is also looking for genes as well as blood markers, working with a team of experts to sequence and analyze the DNA offrom around the world.  And at the UK\u2019s University of Warwick, Ph.D. candidate Sabeeha Malek, another scientist with hEDS, has proposed that EDS might be caused by a fault in the way that collagen binds to cell membranes in connective tissue. If she\u2019s right, she hopes her work will lead to askin biopsy test that could identify all forms of the disease.Progress is being made but on a very small scale. \u201cIf you look at any major academic institution, there are multiple labs studying cancer, multiple labs studying heart disease. When you look at a disease that affects one in 500 people, and probably more than that, there should be a lab studying it at every single academic institution,\u201d says Gensemer.Gensemer hopes that as more discoveries are made and data is accumulated it will \u201cchange the way the medical community looks at the disease\u201d \u2013 and that it will be taken more seriously.A year has passed since Poppy\u2019s diagnosis. The initial shock has subsided, and while I\u2019m still grieving the loss of her health, we\u2019ve both learned to accept our new reality and have adjusted to living with EDS.I\u2019ve assembled a team of supportive doctors and therapists and acquired an arsenal of paraphernalia to fight pain and manage symptoms, including braces and kinesiology tape to hold her joints in place; ice packs, heat pads, tiger balm and arnica gel for sore muscles; and a cupboard full of medications and supplements.With Poppy often stuck at home, I also got her a giant kitten that she calls Bagel, and he provides the best therapy.Writing this article has taught me a lot more about EDS: It\u2019s been upsetting to report on the terrible experiences some have suffered, but I\u2019ve been awestruck by the dedication of people, many with the condition themselves, who are working to find solutions.I don\u2019t know what the future holds for Poppy. Some patients\u2019 symptoms improve with age; others experience an increase in pain and a loss of mobility. I\u2019ve learned there\u2019s a limit to what we can control but there\u2019s a lot wedo, to tackle symptoms and make life easier. And I believe that change is coming.With a better understanding of the condition and diagnostic tools on the horizon, my biggest hope is that there will be a cure one day \u2013 and that it will come in time for Poppy."

        "link": "https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/04/tech/writers-strike-ai/index.html",
        "text": "By any standard, John August is a successful screenwriter. He\u2019s written such films as \u201cBig Fish,\u201d \u201cCharlie\u2019s Angels\u201d and \u201cGo.\u201d But even he is concerned about the impact AI could have on his work.Aof AI tools, trained on vast troves of data online, can now generate essays, song lyrics and other written work in response to user prompts. While there are clearly limits for how well AI tools can produce compelling creative stories, these tools are only getting more advanced, putting writers like August on guard.\u201cScreenwriters are concerned about our scripts being the feeder material that is going into these systems to generate other scripts, treatments, and write story ideas,\u201d August, a Writers Guild of America (WGA) committee member, told CNN. \u201cThe work that we do can\u2019t be replaced by these systems.\u201dAugust is one of the more than 11,000 members of the WGATuesday morning, bringing an immediate halt to the production of some television shows and possibly delaying the start of new seasons of others later this year.Cord cutting, streaming losses and the 'terrifying math' driving the writers strikeWGA is demanding a host of changes from the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP), from an increase in pay to receiving clear guidelines around working with streaming services. But as part of their demands, the WGA is also fighting to protect their livelihoods from AI.In a proposal published on WGA\u2019s website this week, the labor union said AI should be regulated so it \u201ccan\u2019t write or rewrite literary material, can\u2019t be used as source material\u201d and that writers\u2019 work \u201ccan\u2019t be used to train AI.\u201dAugust said the AI demand \u201cwas one of the last things\u201d added to the WGA list, but that it\u2019s \u201cclearly an issue writers are concerned about\u201d and need to address now rather than when their contact is up again in three years. By then, he said, \u201cit may be too late.\u201dWGA said the proposal was rejected by AMPTP, which countered by offering annual meetings to discuss advancements in the technology. August said AMPTP\u2019s response shows they want to keep their options open.In a document sent to CNN responding to some of WGA\u2019s asks, AMPTP said it values the work of creatives and \u201cthe best stories are original, insightful and often come from people\u2019s own experiences.\u201d\u201cAI raises hard, important creative and legal questions for everyone,\u201d it wrote. \u201cWriters want to be able to use this technology as part of their creative process, without changing how credits are determined, which is complicated given AI material can\u2019t be copyrighted. So it\u2019s something that requires a lot more discussion, which we\u2019ve committed to doing.\u201dIt added that the current WGA agreement defines a \u201cwriter\u201d as a \u201cperson,\u201d and said \u201cAI-generated material would not be eligible for writing credit.\u201dThe writers\u2019 attempt at bargaining over AI is perhaps the most high-profile labor battle yet to address concerns about the cutting-edge technology that has captivated the world\u2019s attention in the six months since the public release of ChatGPT.Goldman Sachs economists estimate thatglobally could be automated in some way by the newest wave of AI. White-collar workers, including those in administrative and legal roles, are expected to be the most affected. And the impact may hit sooner than some think: IBM\u2019s CEOsuggested AI could eliminate the need for thousands of jobs at his company alone in the next five years.David Gunkel, a professor at the department of communications at Northern Illinois University who tracks AI in media and entertainment, said screenwriters want clear guidelines around AI because \u201cthey can see the writing on the wall.\u201d\u201cAI is already displacing human labor in many other areas of content creation\u2014copywriting, journalism, SEO writing, and so on,\u201d he said. \u201cThe WGA is simply trying to get out-in-front of and to protect their members against \u2026 \u2018technological unemployment.\u2019\u201dWhile film and TV writers in Hollywood may currently be leading the charge, professionals in other industries will almost certainly be paying attention.\u201cThere\u2019s certainly other industries that need to be paying close attention to this space,\u201d said Rowan Curran, an analyst at Forrester Research who focuses on AI. He noted that digital artists, musicians, engineers, real estate professionals and customer service workers will all feel the impact of generative AI.\u201cWatch this #WGA strike carefully,\u201d Justine Bateman, a writer, director and former actress, wrote in ashortly after the strike kicked off. \u201cUnderstand that our fight is the same fight that is coming to your professional sector next: it\u2019s the devaluing of human effort, skill, and talent in favor of automation and profits.\u201dAI has had a place in Hollywood for years. In the 2018 \u201cMarvel Avengers Infinity Wars\u201d film, the face of Thanos \u2013 a character played by actor Josh Brolin \u2013 was created in part with the technology.Crowd and battle scenes in films including the \u201cLord of the Rings\u201d and \u201cMeg\u201d have utilized AI, and the most recent Indiana Jones used it to make Harrison Ford\u2019s character appear younger. It\u2019s also been used for color correction, finding footage more quickly during post production and making improvements such as removing scratches and dust from footage.But AI in screenwriting is in its infancy. In March, a \u201cSouth Park\u201d episode called \u201cDeep Learning,\u201d was co-written by ChatGPT and the tool was highly focused on in the plot (the characters use ChatGPT to talk to girls and write school papers).August said writers are largely willing to play ball with tools, as long as they\u2019re used as launching pads or for research and writers are still credited and utilized throughout the production process.Film and TV writers go on strike, bringing production on many shows to a halt\u201cScreenwriters are not luddites, and we\u2019ve been quick to use new technologies to help us tell our stories,\u201d August said. \u201cWe went from typewriters to word processors happily and it increased productivity. \u2026. But we don\u2019t need a magical typewriter that types scripts all by itself.\u201dBecause large language models are trained on text that humans have written before, and find patterns in words and sentences to create responses to prompts, concerns around intellectual property exist, too. \u201cIt is entirely possible for a [chatbot] to generate a script in the style of a particular kind of filmmaker or scriptwriter without prior consent of the original artist or the Hollywood studio that holds the IP for that material,\u201d Gunkel said.For example, one could prompt ChatGPT to generate a zombie apocalypse drama in the style of David Mamet. \u201cWho should get credited for that?\u201d August said. \u201cWhat happens if we allow a producer or studio executive to come up with a treatment or pitch or something that looks like a screenplay that no writer has touched?\u201dFor now, the legal landscape remains very much unsettled on the matter, with regulations lagging behind the rapid pace of AI development. In early April, the Biden administration said it is seeking public comments on how to hold artificial intelligence systems like ChatGPT accountable.\u201cWe can\u2019t protect studios from their own bad choices,\u201d August said. \u201cWe can only protect writers from abuses.\u201dThe strike, and the demands around AI specifically, come at a time when both the writers and the studios are feeling financial pain.Many of the businesses represented by AMPTP have seen drops in their stock price, prompting deep cost cutting, including layoffs. The need to manage costs, combined with addressing the fallout from the strike, might only make the companies feel more pressure to turn to AI for scriptwriting.How a writers' strike might affect your favorite TV shows\u201cIn the short term, this could be an effective way to circumvent the WGA strike, mainly because [large language models], which are considered property and not personnel, can be employed for this task without violating the picket line,\u201d Gunkel said. Such an \u201cexperiment\u201d could also show production studios whether it\u2019s possible \u201cto get by with less humans involved,\u201d he said.But Joshua Glick, a visiting professor of film and electronic arts at Bard University, believes such a move would be ill-advised.\u201cIt would be a pretty aggressive and antagonistic move for studios to move forward with AI-generated scripts in terms of getting writers to come to the negotiating table because AI is such a crucial sticking point in the negotiations,\u201d said Glick, who also co-created Deepfake: Unstable Evidence on Screen, an exhibition at the Museum of the Moving Image in New York.\u201cAt the same time, I think the result of those scripts would be pretty mediocre at best,\u201d he said.However the studios react, the issue is unlikely to go away in Hollywood. Film and TV actors\u2019 contracts are up in June, and many are worried about how their faces, bodies and voices will be impacted by AI, August said.\u201cAs writers, we don\u2019t want tools to replace us but actors have the same concerns with AI, as do directors, editors and everyone else who does creative work in this industry,\u201d he added."

        "link": "https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/02/health/veterans-ptsd-psychedelics-wwii-wellness/index.html",
        "text": "Editor\u2019s Note:For decades after returning home from World War II, my grandfather did not talk about his wartime experiences.Frank Murphy flew 21 perilous missions as a navigator of a B-17 for the Eighth Air Force\u2019s 100th Bomb Group, nicknamed \u201cthe Bloody Hundredth.\u201d The day his plane was shot down in 1943, two of the men in his crew died, and my grandfather considered himself lucky to have parachuted out of his burning aircraft and be captured by the Nazis.For the next 18 months, he would endure deplorable conditions as a German prisoner of war, take part in a harrowing death march in subzero temperatures and by the time US Gen. George S. Patton\u2019s troops liberated him, he had lost over 50 pounds and was riddled with dysentery, pneumonia and lice.Everyone could see the physical toll of war on his body, but we didn\u2019t know about his invisible wounds.That is until 2001, more than 50 years after returning home, when my grandfather wrote a memoir, \u201c\u201d for our family. He originally self-published the book that year. St. Martin\u2019s Press released it this year, and the book has since become a New York Times bestseller.In his book, he wrote, \u201cI often wonder why Providence allowed me to survive when so many others did not.\u201dMy mother and his other three children said that their dad never spoke about the war during their childhood. It wasn\u2019t until my mom read his book that she truly knew what he had gone through.Even my grandmother Ann, his wife of 50 years, told me that she did not even know that her soon-to-be-husband had been a prisoner of war until right before they were married.Researching my grandfather\u2019s time during the war, I\u2019ve often wondered if he had post-traumatic stress disorder. I may never know whether he had PTSD or not \u2014 but in the 78 years since World War II ended, it\u2019s so vital that the national conversation around this important topic is moving forward.It\u2019s had different names throughout history. After World War I, it was \u201cshell shock\u201d; post-World War II it was known as \u201ccombat fatigue,\u201d and after Vietnam it was called \u201cpost-Vietnam syndrome.\u201d In 1980, theofficially recognized it as post-traumatic stress disorder, or PTSD.Post-traumatic stress disorder \u201cis a psychiatric disorder that may occur in people who have experienced or witnessed a traumatic event, series of events or set of circumstances. An individual may experience this as emotionally or physically harmful or life-threatening and may affect mental, physical, social, and/or spiritual well-being,\u201d according to the American Psychiatric Association\u2019s website. \u201cExamples include natural disasters, serious accidents, terrorist acts, war/combat, rape/sexual assault, historical trauma, intimate partner violence and bullying.\u201dNow professionals such as psychologist Shauna Springer and psychiatrist Frank Ochberg are advocating calling it post-traumatic brain injury.\u201cI refer to it as an injury because I\u2019ve seen that there\u2019s a biological component to being exposed to trauma as well as a psychological component that has always been with us,\u201d Springer, chief psychologist at the, told me. \u201cAnd now I think we\u2019re on the cusp of evolving the term further.\u201dPost-traumatic brain injury has always existed, Springer said, and people are finally talking about it.\u201cIt\u2019s kind of like saying that because the divorce rate was so much lower in previous generations that everybody had these great marriages,\u201d she said, \u201cbut actually that was a factor of how much stigma there was about divorce and how dependent women were financially at that time without their own career options.\u201dForty percent of medical discharges during WWII were for psychiatric conditions, most for combat stress, according to theIn New Orleans.But veterans didn\u2019t always mention their trauma when they came home from the war.\u201cWhen your grandfather and my grandfather served in World War II, they didn\u2019t talk about it,\u201d Paul Rieckhoff, founder and CEO of Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, told me.\u201cThey came home and too often, you know, their therapy was drinking,\u201d he said. \u201cThere was a generation of folks who had tremendous trauma and pain, and that overflowed into their families in ways that we still can\u2019t even quantify.\u201dMy grandfather was in the infamous Stalag Luft III prison camp, where \u201c\u201d took place. In his memoir, he writes about going to bed hungry, freezing and terrified of never knowing when the war would end.\u201cA prisoner of war experiences real-time feelings of helplessness and you\u2019re on-your-own that cannot be imagined unless you have been there,\u201d my grandpa relates in \u201cLuck of the Draw.\u201d\u201cIt is difficult to put into words the sense of powerlessness and vulnerability one experiences when standing completely defenseless before a formidable armed wartime enemy of your country, knowing that the entire might of the United States is of no benefit to you.\u201dI have his book to remind me, but it\u2019s hard to imagine what else he must have gone through, and the struggles he went through alone, once he was back home.With so many US troops fighting abroad in Iraq and Afghanistan over the past 20 years, the problems my grandpa faced haven\u2019t gone away.About 16 veterans commit suicide each day in the United States, according to. Asked for comment by CNN, the VA did not specify how many of those suicides were related to post-traumatic stress.I became active in the fight for our veterans when I joined the board of directors for the National Museum of the Mighty Eighth Air Force near Savannah, Georgia, in 2015 in honor of my grandfather\u2019s service.I found allies in the cause when I joined the board, including former Texas Gov. Rick Perry. Perry, who has been a vocal supporter of our nation\u2019s veterans, was a pilot in the Air Force before entering politics and eventually becoming the US secretary of energy. His father, like my grandfather, served in the Eighth Air during WWII.\u201cMy instinct here is warriors are very proud, and showing weakness in any form has historically been frowned upon,\u201d he told me.Perry\u2019s attention to the emotional toll of war became heightened when he met Navy SEAL Marcus Luttrell. Luttrell had just returned home from a harrowing experience participating in Operation Red Wings in Afghanistan in 2005. (It went on to become a best-selling book and a 2013 film starring Mark Wahlberg called \u201cLone Survivor.\u201d)  Perry and his wife took Luttrell into their home and got him the psychological support he needed.At same time, Perry was introduced to Amber and Marcus Capone, a couple who had started an organization called Veterans Exploring Treatment Solutions, or VETS, which provides resources, research and advocacy for US military veterans seeking treatment with psychedelic-assisted therapies.They started the group after Marcus Capone returned home from multiple combat deployments in Iraq and Afghanistan and was having suicidal thoughts.\u201cHe didn\u2019t understand why he couldn\u2019t get better,\u201d Amber Capone said. \u201cHe was trying so hard. I just thought of our kids and them living the rest of their lives without a father and how this would impact generations to come, and I just thought, I can\u2019t stop fighting for him.\u201dWhat I want my sons to learn from their great-grandfather's WWII survivalSix years later, VETS says it has provided funding for more than 700 veterans to get access to psychedelic treatments at centers outside the country due to issues with legalization.This is one of the reasons Perry has devoted years to supporting veterans and bipartisan legislation for psychedelic therapy for veterans.\u201cI know this whole concept, Rick Perry\u2019s name and psychedelics in the same sentence, five years ago I would\u2019ve kind of looked at you and said, \u2018What are you talking about?\u2019 \u201d Perry told me. \u201cBut I know kids that were really sick that are now about as close to normal as you can get.\u201dThe legalization of psychedelic treatments varies in the United States. Only a handful of states such as New York, California and Arizona have active legislation proposed to decriminalize plant-based hallucinogens, such as psilocybin, the active ingredient in \u201c,\u201d and dimethyltryptamine, which is found in some plants used to brew.While Oregon and Colorado are the only two US states to have decriminalized psychedelic mushrooms for those over 21, other states such as Texas and Maryland are conducting clinical trials withand ibogaine for those suffering from issues such as PTSD and depression., a neuroscientist and board-certified psychiatrist, has been studying the effects of chronic stress on mental and physical health for nearly 20 years.\u201cWe know that hugs feel good. We know that music makes us feel good if we like listening to our favorite songs, right? That is intuitive, but we don\u2019t necessarily remember to breathe when we\u2019re stressed out,\u201d Rabin said.\u201cPsychedelic medicine is interesting because it works when it\u2019s used properly,\u201d he said. \u201cIt works as a therapy amplifier because it molecularly seems to do something in the brain that amplifies the neural pathways of safety that are set up by the therapeutic environment.\u201dSpringer cofounded the Stella Center, a network of clinics that offer ketamine infusion therapy and dual sympathetic reset for those suffering from post-traumatic stress. Dual sympathetic reset is a procedure involving a local anesthetic injected next to a mass of sympathetic nerves in the neck called the stellate ganglion to help regulate an overactive sympathetic nervous system, according to Stella\u2019s website.\u201cFor some, it\u2019s medication; for some, it\u2019s a service dog,\u201d said Rieckhoff of Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America. \u201cAnd I think everybody\u2019s got to figure out what their right prescription is to meet their unique situation.\u201dAnother individual bringing resources to veterans and their families is ABC News journalist Bob Woodruff.While reporting in the field in Iraq in 2006, Woodruff had a near-death experience that changed the course of his life. An improvised explosive device struck him and his cameraman, and Woodruff was subsequently kept in a medically induced coma for 36 months.How service dogs safeguard, deepen relationships and save us from ourselvesDuring his recovery, he and his wife, Lee Woodruff, were inspired to launch their nonprofit, the, after getting to know veterans who were dealing with the impact of hidden injuries such as traumatic brain injuries.\u201cI would say almost every American wants to do something for veterans who served, but many don\u2019t really know exactly where that support should go because it\u2019s very complicated,\u201d Bob Woodruff said. \u201cWe just kind of help people who want to do something, find the right direction to help people.\u201dTo date, the foundation says it\u2019s investedin these programs and has given over 585 grants to veterans and their familiesAs for the future, Perry said it\u2019s about continuing the conversation.\u201cI think mental health is the most undiagnosed and unknown malady that we have in modern society, potentially,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was there all along.\u201dCorrection: An earlier version of this story misstated the term \u201cdual sympathetic reset.\u201d"

Upon closer inspection and excavation, researchers determined that the find included 175 silver Roman denarii coins. Nearly all were in good condition, making this one of the few hoards of ancient coins found intact, according to the group.But the discovery prompted a number of questions: Whose treasure was it? Who were they hiding it from? And why didn\u2019t they come back for it?The archaeological group, along with the archaeologist official for the provinces of Pisa and Livorno, Dr. Lorella Alderighi, has spent more than a year measuring, weighing and documenting the coins,posted on its Facebook page. Now, the researchers think they have some answers.\u201cThis treasure is about a person\u2019s life, the savings of a soldier\u2019s life and his hopes for building his farm,\u201d Alderighi said via email. \u201cHowever, it also tells a sad story: (T)he owner of the coins died before he could make his dreams come true using his savings. The coins tell his story.\u201dThe hoard will soon be on display in an exhibition at thein Livorno from May 5 to July 2, Alderighi said.It\u2019s impossible to know exactly who buried the coins, Alderighi said, but the coins would most likely have been the treasure of a former soldier who served during Rome\u2019s Social War from 91 to 88 BC and during the civil war between Sulla and the Marians from 83 to 82 BC.The owner of the hoard buried it in a terra-cotta pot, which served as a sort of piggy bank. The earliest coins in the stash dated to 157 or 156 BC, and the latest up to 83 or 82 BC, according to the archaeological group\u2019s release.During that time, 175 denarii would have been a soldier\u2019s salary for about a year and a half, Alderighi said. Now, the treasure has a value of around 20,000 to 25,000 euros, she added.Huge Titanic plan used in 1912 inquiry into ship's sinking sells for $243,000The coins were preserved well in their buried state. Only two are fractured, but they can be reassembled, the release noted. Studying them could provide scholars with more background on the history of coins and how people used them and could even lead to changes with the fundamental typology \u2014\u2014 to identify and date Roman coins, she added.\u201cIt is one of the very few hoards of ancient coins found intact and provides a lot of numismatic, historical and social information,\u201d Alderighi said."

        "link": "https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/03/world/woolly-mammoths-ancient-hormones-scn/index.html",
        "text": "Traces of ancient hormones were detected in the tusks of a woolly mammoth that lived more than 33,000 years ago, revealing that the now-extinct creatures had episodes of raging testosterone.The findings provide what researchers believe to be the first direct evidence that, like elephants, mammoths also experienced musth. A study detailing the findings published Wednesday in the journal.Musth, which means \u201cintoxicated\u201d in Hindi and Urdu, is a testosterone-fueled period of heightened aggression and unpredictable behavior during mating season when male elephants become rivals.Previously, researchers inferred that mammoths, the extinct relatives of modern elephants, might have experienced musth due to the discovery of broken tusk tips and other skeletal injuries preserved in fossils.Evidence of the testosterone surge from musth is can be detected in the blood and urine tests of living elephants.A team of researchers turned to elephant and mammoth tusks to see if their layers might also preserve the presence of steroid hormones like cortisol, said lead study author Michael Cherney, a research affiliate at the University of Michigan Museum of Paleontology and a research fellow at the University of Michigan Medical School.Meatballs made with mammoth DNA created by Australian food startupIn addition to cortisol, the mammoth tusk revealed annually recurring testosterone surges up to 10 times higher than baseline, according to the study.\u201cWe didn\u2019t really know what to expect, so most everything was a surprise,\u201d Cherney said. \u201cI think the biggest surprise, however, was just how clear the pattern in testosterone was.\u201dThe researchers studied three tusks during their analysis, including two adult mammoth tusks and one from an African bull elephant that was between 30 to 40 years old when it was killed by a hunter in Botswana in 1963.The right tusk of the male mammoth, which lived to be about 55 years old, was uncovered by a diamond mining company in Siberia in 2007 and is estimated to have died between 33,291 and 38,866 years ago.A tusk from a female mammoth that lived between 5,597 and 5,885 years ago ond was also used in the study. Wrangel Island, once connected to northeast Siberia, is the last known place where woolly mammoths lived until going extinct about 4,000 years ago.Inbreeding among the last woolly mammoths may have led to extinctionAnnual growth increments were identified in each tusk using CT scans. Then, the researchers used a drill bit operated beneath a microscope to grind samples of dentin, the mineralized tissue inside teeth, since tusks are elongated incisors.The dentin powder was analyzed using a mass spectrometer, or an instrument that can identify chemicals by sorting charged particles.\u201cWe had developed steroid mass spectrometry methods for human blood and saliva samples, and we have used them extensively for clinical research studies. But never in a million years did I imagine that we would be using these techniques to explore \u2018paleoendocrinology,\u2019\u201d said study coauthor Rich Auchus, professor of internal medicine and pharmacology at the University of Michigan Medical School, in a statement.Discovery in paleontologist's backyard reveals evidence of North America's early humans\u201cWe did have to modify the method some, because those tusk powders were the dirtiest samples we ever analyzed. When Mike (Cherney) showed me the data from the elephant tusks, I was flabbergasted. Then we saw the same patterns in the mammoth \u2014 wow!\u201dBoth the elephant and male mammoth tusks contained evidence ofmusth-related testosterone surges. Meanwhile, the female mammoth tusk showed little variation and very low testosterone, as expected.Tusks are a bit like tree rings. They grow throughout the life of an animal, recording molecules like hormones that are tied to an animal\u2019s behavior and physiology. Testosterone accumulates within tissues and circulates in the bloodstream.\u201cTusks hold particular promise for reconstructing aspects of mammoth life history because they preserve a record of growth in layers of dentin that form throughout an individual\u2019s life,\u201d said study coauthor Daniel Fisher, a curator at the University of Michigan Museum of Paleontology and professor in the Department of Earth and Environmental Sciences, in a statement.When scientists study elephant tusks, they can identify the age when the animals experience musth, if it happens at the same time of year and other factors that help them uncover more information about environmental factors and population dynamics, Cherney said. Gleaning this type of information from mammoth tusks can reveal more insights into the lifetimes of the extinct creatures.A 'near complete' mummified baby woolly mammoth was discovered in a Canadian gold fieldThe researchers believe their findings show that the hormone records in teeth could contain key information that can last for thousands of years, especially when studying ancient populations.\u201cThis study establishes dentin as a useful repository for some hormones and sets the stage for further advances in the developing field of paleoendocrinology,\u201d Cherney said. \u201cIn addition to broad applications in zoology and paleontology, tooth-hormone records could support medical, forensic and archaeological studies.\u201d"

        "text": "With their cornflower blues, candy floss pinks, and pumpkin oranges, photographer Preet Uday\u2019s images of Dubai conjure a bittersweet nostalgia.Most photographers prefer to show the luxury and vast scale that Dubai is known for today, from colossal skyscrapers to towering sand dunes and sweeping coastlines \u2013 but Uday\u2019s fans say his quirky images remind them of a gentler age.According to Uday, he\u2019s been contacted by people all over the world who share the same sentiment. \u201cThey say the images take them back to another time,\u201d he says. \u201cIt gives them a feeling of warmth \u2013 a happiness. It reminds them of their childhood, and that\u2019s a global feeling, not just in Dubai.\u201dIn contrast to the futuristic steel and glass that makes up the city, Uday captures quiet and modest moments. He didn\u2019t set out to show another side of the city, it just happened organically. Originally from Secunderabad in south-central India, Uday, 46, moved to Dubai in the early 2000s. \u201cI grew up in the 90s, so subconsciously I\u2019m influenced by that era,\u201d he says.Uday says he likes his work to render the location abstract, showing just a tiny section of a wider scene \u2013 something that encapsulates a universal emotion or yearning by retaining a geographic intangibility. \u201cThere\u2019s a surrealism in that, it feels like another place,\u201d he says.His images convey a strange sense of otherness, of another place or another time. Perhaps this is the source of the nostalgia they seem to generate \u2013 or maybe it\u2019s all the classic cars he photographs. Uday says though he wouldn\u2019t call himself a classic car enthusiast, he loves their design and aesthetic, and usually finds at least one vintage-looking car whenever he goes out shooting in the city.A portrait photographer by trade, Uday says these landscape snapshots are a new passion that he began developing in the eerie quiet of pandemic lockdown restrictions.\u201cDuring the Covid period, everything shut down and I had no business coming in,\u201d he says. \u201cI had lots of free time, so I started walking in the streets, taking pictures and posting them online. For some reason, these images got me attention.\u201dOver the last two years, Uday\u2019s images have gained him a healthy following on social media, and his popularity continues to grow.\u201cThe first thing that attracts me is color,\u201d says Uday. \u201cColor palettes, minimalism and a certain simplicity within a scene.\u201dThough his images look as though they have been captured on film, all of Uday\u2019s photography is done on a digital camera. \u201cThese days I\u2019m even starting to create with the iPhone,\u201d he says.Before Uday shoots a particular district, he walks around and gets a feel for its character. He says this slow approach allows for more honest and intimate images. \u201cIt means you get to see finer details of that particular area and how people live,\u201d says Uday. \u201cYou get to know the unique color palette of that particular area.\u201dEven though he only began working in this style in 2020, Uday has already shown at several galleries in Dubai and is considering publishing a photobook. \u201cI could literally make two or three books,\u201d he laughs. \u201cThat is the volume of pictures I have.\u201d\u201cBut I know I have only just scratched the surface on this genre,\u201d says Uday. \u201cI have many more color palettes and images in my mind just waiting to be created.\u201d"

        "text": "Editor\u2019s Note:CNN Travel\u2019s series often carries sponsorship originating from the countries and regions we profile. However, CNN retains full editorial control over all of its reports..Out in the hot, shimmering desert sands of western Qatar, something alien, colossal and very weird looms over the horizon.There\u2019s seemingly no logic to the appearance of four gigantic monoliths stretching out into the distance along a barren corridor between low limestone cliffs.And yet these metallic invaders have made themselves oddly at home in the rough landscape \u2013 adding a majestic dimension to this corner of the tiny Gulf nation.The steel plates, located across a kilometer of desert on Qatar\u2019s Zekreet Peninsula, are the work of Richard Serra, an American artist known for creating imposing metalwork sculptures.Titled \u201cEast-West/West-East,\u201d the landmarks, which rise up to 16.7 meters, were installed in 2014 after Serra was asked by art-loving Qatari royalty to make his mark on their country.Several years down the line, the plates are standing as bold as ever. Tarnished by rust and scratched with graffiti, but no less imposing for it.Keeping watch over empty terrain, these sentinels look as though they\u2019ll last forever.For its creator, the artwork\u2019s obscure location in awhere summer temperatures can breach 50 C (122 F) was both a source of inspiration and concern.\u201cThis is the most fulfilling thing I\u2019ve ever done,\u201d he told theat the time of its installation. \u201cIt\u2019s a piece I\u2019d really like to be seen and I don\u2019t know if it will.\u201dHe needn\u2019t have worried.13 best things to see and do in QatarWhile hardly overrun, \u201cEast-West/West-East\u201d has become a place of occasional pilgrimage for locals, tourists and art devotees alike, adding to a roster of Qatar desert activities that includes dune bashing, Bedouin camps and camel treks.Getting there isn\u2019t easy though.The nearest major highway is more than five kilometers away. There\u2019s no road leading to the sculpture and the tracks that criss-cross nearby desert aren\u2019t clearly signposted.Anyone driving there will require an off-road vehicle, which aren\u2019t typically available to hire for self-drive in Qatar. So visitors will either need a local friend with access to big wheels, or join an organized trip \u2013comes highly recommended ().And unless you\u2019re with someone who knows the way, a GPS device will come in handy. Despite its size, \u201cEast-West/West-East\u201d can\u2019t be seen from the main road. The only clue to the turnoff is a signpost prosaically pointing the way to \u201cCamel Underpass No. 7.\u201dThen it\u2019s a case of picking a route carefully through a maze of rutted tracks in the sand, past occasional encampments.Katara: The center of Qatar's creative sceneIt\u2019s a bad place for a flat tire or breakdown \u2013 there are few other vehicles out here and, beyond lizards and perhaps a lost camel, barely any living creatures.When the sculptures come into view though, it\u2019s all worth it \u2013 especially for fans of classic sci-fi movie \u201c.\u201dBecause they\u2019re spaced out at 250-meter intervals along a straight line, they rear up slowly, each one dwarfing the next in a clearly deliberate trick of perspective.Up close they\u2019re neck-craningly tall, throwing out huge shadows that lengthen rapidly as the hot sun scoots through the afternoon. They\u2019re solid enough to absorb strikes without making much of a sound, yet viewed side-on they\u2019re barely there at all.It\u2019s hard to get a true sense of scale unless there are other humans around, but it\u2019s worth making the somewhat rocky five-minute scramble to the top of the nearby cliffs to take in the full view of the monoliths stretching out toward the sea.And if the temperatures aren\u2019t too unbearable, walking the sculpture\u2019s full kilometer is a must.Serra\u2019s fear about lack of visitors was clearly unfounded if the amount of graffiti scrawled on the metal plates over the years is anything to go by. Though hardly an enhancement, it\u2019s become part of the artwork.Back during a CNN visit in 2014, some of the graffiti merely declared \u201cI was here,\u201d but others are outlets for artistic debate or national pride \u2013 with some of the more recent homegrown Qatari additions voicing defiance in the face of.Perhaps unsurprisingly, the highest graffiti on one of the plates was apparently the work of visitors from the Himalayan kingdom of Nepal.Deserts of Qatar: Escape from DohaWhile there\u2019s plenty to take in at \u201cEast-West/West-East,\u201d the artwork isn\u2019t the only attraction the Zekreet Peninsula has to offer.A short drive farther west leads to the Al Reem Biosphere Reserve, a UNESCO-protected area that\u2019s supposedly home to gazelles, oryx, osprey and other rare desert fauna, though they seem to be hard to spot.Inside are more local oddities.Firstly there\u2019s Film City, a fortified little town that stands empty in the desert, a Qatari flag rippling on the mast atop its tallest tower. The gates are typically open and visitors can stop, explore and, if they\u2019re lucky, share a cup of sweet tea with the security guard.There\u2019s no real intrigue surrounding this place. It was built as a filming location and has made occasional appearances in Arabic dramas and promos for soccer\u2019s Qatar-hosted 2022 FIFA World Cup.Somewhat more mysterious \u2013 in appearance at least \u2013 are the \u201cdesert mushrooms\u201d of Qatar, another few kilometers along the peninsula.Here, centuries of wind erosion have hollowed out a limestone bowl, carving the rocks into beautiful, mushroom-like shapes. One prominent feature, known as \u201cumbrella rock,\u201d is an island of weathered stone topped by an inaccessible building.Souq Waqif: 10 things to see and do at Doha's 'standing market'This, and other small structures in the hollow are recreations of traditional shelters used for storing dates.These days, they\u2019re merely the final stop on a tour of one of the more unusual destinations in the Arabian Gulf.Or the beautiful backdrop for a night camping under the stars, swapping stories about strange things in the desert."

        "link": "https://edition.cnn.com/style/article/metaverse-real-estate-market-2022-spc-intl/index.html",
        "text": "Written bySpeak to people working in the metaverse and one descriptor follows it around: \"It's like the Wild West.\" Make of that what you will. Is it a new frontier for people seeking their fortune? A lawless land? A place characterized by the unknown, removed from the rest of society? Perhaps all of the above. But one thing's for sure -- people in the Wild West weren't dropping$650,000 in cryptocurrency on a digital yacht.The metaverse -- a growing number of immersive virtual online worlds where users live and play -- has become a hotbed of real estate speculation. Investors are betting on it being an integral part of a possible paradigm shift in how we use the internet -- a decentralized version calledWeb3, which its supporters argue will wrest control of the web from big tech companies and distribute power, privacy and security back to users.According to consultancy firm McKinsey, corporations, venture capitalists and private equity invested $120 billion in the metaverse between January and May 2022, more than double the $57 billion invested in 2021.But real estate values have had a rocky ride. Land prices in the four major metaverse platforms, The Sandbox, Decentraland, Cryptovoxels and Somnium Space, have fallen 50 to 80% this year, according to Winston Robson, CEO and co-founder of metaverse analytics company WeMeta. He pointed to problems in the real-world economy and the cryptocurrency market as contributing to the decline.Look beyond the numbers, however, and you'll find whole professions being shaken up, from architects and designers to developers and real estate agents. And far from being isolated to the metaverse, their ventures there are already impacting the real world.George Bileca, CEO of Voxel Architects, studied architecture and design, and was working towards a career in car design when he was given some land in Cryptovoxels to play with. At the start of the pandemic, he used it to build a dealership to sell NFTs (non-fungible tokens) ofdigital carsdesigned by his friend. Two years later, Bileca has a team of 25 working full time in the metaverse.Voxel Architects, headquartered in Portugal, has designed and built over 100 metaverse projects, said the CEO, including galleries for auction house Sotheby's, fashion week venues and an NFT manufacturing plant for American artistTom Sachs. Next up: an officialElvis Presley experiencein The Sandbox and Decentraland.Sotheby's in Decentraland, designed and built by Voxel Architects. The building is modeled on the real-life auction house on New Bond Street, London.Initially, the design process for metaverse buildings is much the same as in the real world, said Bileca. An architect or designer consults with a client, and sketches ideas, either on paper or computer. Once a design is agreed upon, it is 3D-modeled, using traditional design software, but conforming to the design spec of the metaverse it will populate (different metaverses use different building blocks, and have different texture and color ranges).Then coding begins. \"The build is only an empty carcass,\" Bileca explained. \"On top of that shell we add the functionality, like being able to open doors, to interact with artworks ... to create custom (user interfaces), gameplay quests and many other interactive elements.\" Once completed, it is deployed into a metaverse.Voxel Architects designed Auroboros, a venue for Metaverse Fashion Week in March 2022.  Recording artist Grimes held a concert during the event.The studio charges an hourly rate for its work, with some projects running into the hundreds of thousands of dollars -- the most expensive being close to $500,000 for designing, building and deploying a development in The Sandbox, says Bileca, who did not reveal the client.Some are buying properties for recreational use; others are trying to generate revenue from their land. Some are building retail spaces or ticketed experiences; others are renting their land to brands trying to reach consumers in the metaverse. According to McKinsey, e-commerce in the metaverse could have up to a$2.6 trillionmarket impact by 2030.LandVault claims to be the biggest land developer in the metaverse, renting its land to brands and developing campaigns for them. Just don't call it advertizing, insists CEO Sam Huber. \"In Web3 ... the word actually doesn't have a place,\" he said. \"What we're building is not advertizing. It's brand experiences, which is very different.\"He gave the example of playing a game in the metaverse, inside an arena bearing a Mastercard logo. \"You can still play your game. That is not advertizing. That is not annoying. That is like real life,\" he argued.\"(Online) advertising as we know it, intrusive ... compromising user data and so on -- that just doesn't have a place in Web3.\"Metaverse developer LandVault has created brand experiences for the likes of Mastercard.As with the real world, location has a large impact on rental price. Being in an area with high footfall, near a much-loved game or close to a prized asset (a celebrity's house, for example) can be important. But some are making the case that good design has value too.One advocate is Janine Yorio, CEO of Everyrealm. The metaverse development company, previously known as Republic Realm, has received $66 million in funding to date and is backed by celebrities including The Weeknd, Will Smith and Paris Hilton. Its luxury projects have generated headlines. In November 2021 Everyrealm bought 792 parcels of The Sandbox (the equivalent of about three square miles) for $4.3 million -- still a record purchase. Around the same time it sold the $650,000 superyacht,the Metaflower, complete with DJ booth, helipad and hot tub for the discerning buyer.The company's latest venture is The Row, an upcoming invite-only community of 30 houses. Everyrealm invited artists including Daniel Arsham, Misha Kahn and Alexis Christodoulou to contribute designs. Alongside neoclassical buildings and giant cantilevers are alien shapes, fulfilling the promise of digital architecture unbound by the laws of physics.\"We really let the artists just have free rein,\" said Yorio. The driving principal, she added, was \"architecture so important and exclusive, that it becomes something that people look to as sort of a high watermark.\"A rendering of a property designed by Barcelona-based studio Six N. Five for Everyrealm project The Row.Yorio cites Everyrealm's Fantasy Island project -- in which 100 private islands in The Sandbox sold out in a single afternoon in August 2021 -- as an example of how these assets can appreciate. Sold at approximately $15,000 each, the CEO said they now trade for around $100,000, down from $250,000 at the height of the cryptocurrency and NFT market boom in late 2021.Buyers of property in The Row will be purchasing architectural plans in the form of an NFT, which can be built and deployed on different platforms.Alexis Christodoulou Studio has made a name in 3-D design and has clients including Kenzo and Microsoft. Now it is working on digital property, including this rendering of a home for The Row.\"We want to adhere to the ethos of decentralization,\" Yorio said, but the sale model also speaks to the uncertainty that hangs over investing in the metaverse. \"It's very difficult to know which metaverse is going to be the most popular in one year or five years,\" she said.With the name of the development inspired by Billionaires' Row in Manhattan, Everyrealm has enlisted the services of elite New York real estate brokers Oren and Tal Alexander to oversee sales.The Alexander brothers are currently screening prospective buyers, said Yorio, with private sales starting in September. \"We want to make sure that art goes to the right type of collectors, and not people that are looking to buy and flip and create that NFT hyper-speculation dynamic,\" she explained. Prices were not disclosed to CNN.Yorio disputed the idea The Row was an example of the metaverse heading towards social stratification. \"This is about owning one of the first seminal works of three-dimensional inhabitable art in a new media. And I think that's a very different conversation (to), 'we're building a country club that only 30 people can join,'\" she argued.The long-term value of metaverse property may also hinge on whether users decide to work as well as play there.Pallavi Dean, CEO of Dubai-based design studio Roar, is already doing so, having bought company space in Decentraland. Dean wanted to showcase Roar's work to clients and purchased four plots for around $60,000 in total in January 2022. \"You have to have skin in the game before you convince other people,\" she said. \"I'm writing this off as marketing money.\"She's already moved some of her business operations into the metaverse, hosting client meetings in Roar's virtual office. In the next couple of months, she plans to run a training course from her metaverse meeting room.Dubai-based design studio Roar has established a company space in Decentraland.Roar is also looking to generate revenue in the metaverse, building an NFT gallery, a retail space and floating pods which could become a hotel. Although Dean concedes she's still waiting for her first rental and first NFT sale, she remains hopeful of future growth.Given the short lifetime and rapid acceleration of the metaverse, long-term forecasting is hazardous -- especially as the property market experiences growing pains. But could real estate in the metaverse ever become as reliable an investment as bricks and mortar? Or could this be Web3's equivalent of thedot-com bubble?\"It's hard to know if the real estate inside (metaverses) is going to be stable ... Least of all us, and we're deeply in it,\" said Yorio.Many on the outside may be viewing its long-term prospects with more than a hint of caution. Understandably, some people working in this burgeoning industry remain bullish.\"It's very possible that real estate in the metaverse is a stable investment in the future,\" said Robson, of analytics company WetMeta, in an email.\"This is not a bubble,\" insisted Huber, who distils the metaverse down to a combination of two trends: gaming and the blockchain, neither of which could be called a fad. \"There is an element of hype if you start zooming in -- the price of land tripling over the last six months. It's obviously driven by speculation. But this is a short blip and now it's corrected.\"\"(On a) short-term basis, there's tons of hype,\" he added. \"But that's not what I'm interested in. I'm interested in the macro -- and the macro is definitely here to stay.\""

Nowadays, it is more loosely used to refer to some of Africa\u2019s largest and most iconic animals.However, British photographer Graeme Green has reclaimed the narrative, creating a global \u201cNew Big Five\u201d for wildlife photography. In 2021, 50,000 people around the world voted for the five animals they would most like to photograph, or see photographed, in the wild. Five animals were crowned the winners: the elephant, polar bear, lion, gorilla and tiger.This week, sees the publication of \u201c\u201d photography book, which features images of those animals and other at-risk wildlife, from photography legends such as Ami Vitale, Steve McCurry and, and essays from famous conservationists and activists including likeand.Green says that the book celebrates wildlife and is a global call to action on issues impacting wildlife, including habitat loss, poaching, pollution and climate change.Green was on assignment in Botswana at least a decade ago when he came up with the idea for a project to encourage people to \u201cshoot with a camera, not a gun,\u201d he says.\u201cI thought this would be a way to get people really focusing on wildlife, thinking about the wildlife they love, thinking about the animals that are at risk.\u201dTen photographs that made the world wake up to climate changeIn total, the book includes the work of 144 globally renowned wildlife photographers from Ecuador to India. Curating the images took nearly two years of work, says Green.\u201cI think these are some of the most beautiful and creative images that I\u2019ve seen put together in one book,\u201d says Green. \u201cThese are the species that we are at risk of losing.\u201dAccording to the, nature is declining at an unprecedented rate, with around one million of the planet\u2019s animal and plant species facing extinction. The \u201cNew Big 5,\u201d all of which are threatened, act as ambassadors for what is happening in the natural world, says Green.As well as being a powerful reminder of what we stand to lose, the book also points people towards potential solutions. Featured essays explore the benefits of rewilding and the importance of indigenous communities in conservation.A chapter on endangered species from bees to blue whales illustrates the alarming threat climate change poses to animals outside of the \u201cNew Big 5.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s only the tip of the iceberg \u2013 I could have included thousands of pictures because that\u2019s how serious the situation is,\u201d says Green.Why a wildlife photographer took 40,000 photos to capture these extraordinary birdsJane Goodall, a leading conservationist who also wrote the afterword to the book, said in a press release that \u201cwe have a window of time during which we can start to heal some of the harm we have inflicted on the natural world, but only if we get together and take action now.\u201cI hope the photos will lead people into the wonderful worlds of these iconic species. Then, perhaps, other people will become involved in helping to create a world where wildlife can flourish for future generations to enjoy,\u201d she said."

        "link": "https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/02/world/webb-telescope-planet-star-atmosphere-scn/index.html",
        "text": "The James Webb Space Telescope has detected water vapor around a rocky exoplanet that orbits a star located 26 light-years away from Earth.Now, astronomers are trying to determine whether that water vapor is an indicator of what would be the first-known presence of an atmosphere around a rocky exoplanet.Small, cool red dwarf stars are the most common stars in the universe. The exoplanets found in the \u201chabitable zone\u201d \u2014 the perfect distance from a star to allow the planet to be warm enough to host liquid water on its surface \u2014 often orbit red dwarfs very closely since they aren\u2019t as warm as the sun.James Webb Space Telescope discovers its first exoplanetRed dwarf stars lash out with ultraviolet and X-ray radiation that has the potential to demolish fragile layers of gas, leading scientists to question whether rocky planets orbiting them can maintain \u2014 or regain \u2014 atmospheres.Astronomers observed a hot, rocky exoplanet called GJ 486 b using the Webb telescope. The planet is about 30% larger than Earth and has much stronger surface gravity than our planet.The planet is so close to its host star that GJ 486 b completes one orbit around it every 1.5 Earth days, and this proximity heats the planet to a surface temperature of 800 degrees Fahrenheit (430 degrees Celsius). Astronomers believe the planet is tidally locked, meaning that one side always faces the star while the other is a permanent night side \u2014 similar to how the moon orbits Earth.Although the scorching temperatures make the planet too hot to be habitable, observations of GJ 486 b with Webb\u2019s Near-Infrared Spectrograph revealed hints of water vapor. A study detailing the findings has been accepted for publication in The Astrophysical Journal Letters.The presence of water vapor could suggest that GJ 486 b somehow has an atmosphere, despite its heat and proximity to the star.Webb telescope captures its first direct image of an exoplanetWhile water vapor has previously been detected on gaseous exoplanets, scientists have yet to find an atmosphere around a rocky exoplanet \u2014 doing so would be a landmark event, since that would make it similar in a way to planets in our solar system like Earth and Mars, which are considered rocky.\u201cWater vapor in an atmosphere on a hot rocky planet would represent a major breakthrough for exoplanet science. But we must be careful and make sure that the star is not the culprit,\u201d said study coauthor Kevin Stevenson, principal investigator on the Webb observing program at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory in Laurel, Maryland, in a statement.The team observing GJ 486 b watched as the planet crossed in front of its star twice, and then they used multiple methods to analyze the data captured by the telescope\u2019s instruments.When planets pass in front of their stars, also known as a transit, the starlight can filter through a planet\u2019s atmosphere and highlight the chemical traces of different gases and elements. The results from the Webb data analysis pointed to water vapor being present around GJ 486 b.But astronomers are taking care with their interpretation of the findings because it\u2019s possible that the water vapor is connected to the star itself.NASA's Webb telescope captures first evidence of carbon dioxide on an exoplanet\u201cWe see a signal, and it\u2019s almost certainly due to water. But we can\u2019t tell yet if that water is part of the planet\u2019s atmosphere, meaning the planet has an atmosphere, or if we\u2019re just seeing a water signature coming from the star,\u201d said lead study author Sarah Moran, postdoctoral research associate at the University of Arizona in Tucson, in a statement.Water vapor even exists on our sun in sunspot regions. Sunspots or starspots are areas that appear dark on stars because they\u2019re cooler than other parts of the surface.Since the red dwarf star hosting GJ 486 b is much smaller and cooler than the sun, it may contain even more water vapor in its starspots \u2014 enough to create a signal that could be misinterpreted as a planetary atmosphere surrounding the closely orbiting exoplanet, according to the researchers.\u201cWe didn\u2019t observe evidence of the planet crossing any starspots during the transits. But that doesn\u2019t mean that there aren\u2019t spots elsewhere on the star. And that\u2019s exactly the physical scenario that would imprint this water signal into the data and could wind up looking like a planetary atmosphere,\u201d said study coauthor Ryan MacDonald, a NASA Sagan Fellow at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, in a statement.Astronomers detect heaviest element ever found in exoplanet atmospheresThe heat and radiation from the star would likely erode GJ 486 b\u2019s potential atmosphere over time. If the exoplanet currently has an atmosphere, it would need replenishment from a constant source, like steam from volcanoes.Future observations of the planet using different instruments on the Webb telescope could reveal additional details about the source of the water vapor.\u201cIt\u2019s joining multiple instruments together that will really pin down whether or not this planet has an atmosphere,\u201d Stevenson said."

        "text": ".Exceptionally well-preserved fossils of tiny worms, starfish, sponges, barnacles and other creatures with no modern parallel discovered at a quarry in Wales are painting a picture of life on Earth 462 million years ago.It was a critical time in the planet\u2019s history when there was virtually no life on land, but animals and algae were thriving in the seas.The Castle Bank fossil site near Llandrindod Wells in Powys is remarkable because of the time period it captures and because the fossils show soft tissue such as eyes, nerves, the gut and brain that are preserved as films of carbon in mudstone, according to a new paper published in the journalon Monday.Bats are an evolutionary mystery. This fossil could fill in a piece of the puzzleThe site gives a fuller picture of the variety of life in the deep past \u2014 not just the animals with hard shells and bones that are usually found as fossils.Joseph Botting, study author and honorary research fellow at Amgueddfa Cymru Museum Wales, had first spotted a sponge at the site in 2013 and collected some similar fossils over the years \u2014 but he hadn\u2019t conducted an in-depth study on the site.In April 2020, with time afforded by a Covid-19 lockdown, he went back to the fossil site, which is near his home, and he discovered a piece of rock \u201cwhich had things with tentacles in.\u201d\u201cI basically didn\u2019t sleep that night. As soon as you find that sort of level of soft tissue you know that anything could fossilize. So at that pointwe knew it was going to be important,\u201d he said.The fossils come from a period of time known as the Ordovician when life was becoming more complex. The earlier Cambrian period witnessed the origins of animals but by the end of the Ordovician period, Earth was home to more varied anddiverse ecosystems.Most of the 170 animals discovered so far from the fossil site were tiny (1-5millimeters) and many were either completely soft-bodied when alive or had a tough skin or exoskeleton. The vast majority appear to be completely unknown species.While other soft bodied creatures from the past have preserved in a similar way, most notably in the Burgess Shale deposits in the Canadian Rockies in British Columbia, Castle Bank dates from 50 million years later in the Middle Ordovician.\u201cThere\u2019s no comparable site of the same age. It\u2019s a completely unique site,\u201d said Lucy Muir, study coauthor and also an honorary research fellow at Amgueddfa Cymru Museum Wales.Muir and Botting, who are married, said they also wanted to highlight the contribution of their local community to the discovery.  A crowdfunding project to buy microscopy equipment helped them identify the animals and understand the importance of the site."

He was the director of global engagement in the Obama White House and an American diplomat in Ivory Coast, Venezuela, Iraq and Madagascar. The views expressed here are his own. Readon CNN.Oops \u2026 we did it again. The US national security team is once more ignominiously living out the line made famous by pop star Britney Spears after finding itself back in the uncomfortable position ofping-pong around the internet. As a veteran of the National Security Council and State Department, I have a couple of ideas about what we need to change to get Spears\u2019 song off repeat.We don\u2019t have all the details yet about how and whichfound their way to social media this time. But thea Massachusetts Air National Guard member who allegedly ran a social media group where the information was posted. Officials familiar with the situationthat the leaked documents appear to be part of a daily intelligence briefing prepared for top Pentagon leaders.The Pentagon has already started taking steps towho have access to such sensitive information. But much more can be done. Beyond this particular case and its apparent origins with a member of a reserve unit in the military, another vulnerability looms. Why do so many people, especially those working short stints in government, have access to information that can shape the fate of nations and their leaders?, it\u2019s beenresponsible for. Whatever other steps are taken, the Biden administration must not miss the opportunity to close this loophole as well and shut the revolving door of access to our most sensitive secrets.Twenty years ago, the War on Terror led to ain the use ofacross our government, from translators to. We needed to rapidly ramp up our response to the terrorist threat and staff operations across two battle zones, and it was faster and easier in many cases to hire contractors than to seek congressional approval for permanent national security positions.But now, too much of our intelligence, defense and diplomatic structure relies on people who are essentially temps. The Office of the Secretary of Defense alone. Unfortunately, onboarding new career officials can take years. The State Department, which the Biden administrationto rebuild after being degraded, has onlygrow.Leaked Pentagon documents suggest US is pessimistic Ukraine can quickly end war against RussiaIt\u2019s time for us to both right-size and rethink the role of contractors, some of whom, based on my experience, can have access to way too much highly classified intelligence, including the Pentagon\u2019s daily briefing. Unfortunately, as we have painfully learned from past transgressions, including the well-known case ofEdward Snowden, who leaked a sensitive surveillance program to the media, and the less well-known case of Shapour Moinian, who just last year pleaded guilty toto the Chinese, contractors\u2019 sense of duty and dedication can be lacking.As an American diplomat, I managed and at times had to mitigate many of the difficulties presented by a large contract staff. Too often, they had a short-term focus and were motivated by money, not mission. I saw theI served on atoutside of Tikrit, Iraq, plagued by problems with contractors underperforming, overbilling and creating serious security situations by straining ties with our Iraqi counterparts.To be sure, most contractors do make critical contributions to our national security mission. They add, perform logistical tasks that are not good uses of career officials\u2019 time and fill gaps from staff shortages. And the speed and convenience in hiring make it easier to get some things done. But the sheer volume of contractors used has left some of our most sensitive programs and intelligence extraordinarily and unnecessarily exposed.What really needs to change isto. For contractors specifically, a new standard should be instituted that limits theirto exceptional circumstances \u2013 and only then when an agency head approves it.This administrative action could cost the government some money by forcing it to hire more permanent employees for roles requiring that level of information. But it would be worth it to massively reduce our vulnerabilities. It could also help restore the confidence of allies in our ability to safeguard what they share with us.Leaked Pentagon documents provide snapshot of US intelligence officials watching ChinaBut beyond contractors, there are other short-time workers who contribute to the problem. And they sit at the top of the organization. When President Joe Biden came into office, heto elevate experience and empower career officials. That did not happen. Instead, the upper ranks of the Defense and State Departments, along with the National Security Council, werewith political appointees and other non-Foreign Service staff. This is particularly dangerous following the institutional destruction and devastation left by the Trump administration.Political appointees often avoid tackling really tough bureaucratic challenges like the overreliance on contractors. After all, they seldom stick around long enough (in many cases less than two years) to understand the classification system, let alone do anything to improve how it operates. And even if they get how it works, it can take too much time beyond that to address such systematic issues. Systemic changes also often trigger institutional resistance, and political appointees might not have the deep relationships and institutional knowledge to get changes made in the first place. Finally, there are few incentives or rewards on offer for those who achieve an important administrative advance.While Oval Office holders are unlikely to stop handing out jobs to political allies, Biden can still make improvements. For starters, there should be a minimum time commitment from those appointed to high political office. I\u2019ve seen too many posts on my LinkedIn over the last year from Biden appointees hailing the few months they spent in their positions before moving on. This turnover creates massive disruptions and gaps in our national security structure.The next change ought to be in appointees\u2019 job descriptions, with each one required to make at least three substantive security improvements developed by their team during their tenure.We won\u2019t ever completely secure our secrets, and we will always need some contractors. However, there are a number of fairly easy and effective steps that Biden and his team can take now. Don\u2019t wait for a long review. Don\u2019t blame the last administration, as it did with the. Don\u2019t expect the next person to deal with it.Biden came into officeconfidence in our beleaguered national security bureaucracy. He can and must do more, before we once again are playing Spears\u2019 hit track."

The free press is a pillar, maybe the pillar of a free society, not the enemy.\u201dThe secret of the presidential cue cardThe audience at the Washington Hilton represented a \u201cwho\u2019s who\u201d of officials within the Biden administration, with some top White House officials seated at the dais. First Lady Jill Biden, Vice President Kamala Harris and second gentleman Doug Emhoff were all in attendance Saturday evening. The event also boasted a number of high-profile celebrity guests like Chrissy Teigen and John Legend.Beyond one-liners, the president\u2019s remarks were calibrated to his reelection campaign priorities and the topical issues he often discusses at the podium \u2013 such as the economy and the ongoing war in Ukraine.But Biden took special care to address the issue of wrongfully detained Americans abroad.Biden made a lot of promises on the campaign trail in 2020. Here's what he's actually been able to accomplishSaturday\u2019s dinner took place about a month after the arrest of American citizen, a Wall Street Journal correspondent based in Moscow. The United States has designated him as wrongfully detained by Russia.\u201cTonight, our message is this: Journalism is not a crime,\u201d Biden said Saturday.Earlieron groups in Russia and Iran accused of taking Americans hostage as the Biden administration works to prevent more captive-taking and potentially secure the release of citizens currently being detained.This year\u2019s dinner also comes amid a media industry reckoning. The state of the economy, fears of a recession and dried up investment capital have played a large part in what\u2019s driven the dramatic industry changes over the last several months. But other struggles, like high-profile legal issues and ratings woes, have also been apparent.Typically, presidential speechwriters work through remarks for a few weeks., at his first correspondents\u2019 dinner since becoming president, Biden told his team he envisioned an address that went beyond just a series of one-liners, wisecracks and gags \u2013 a tactic he employed again Saturday night.Still, the dinner gave Biden a rare chance to flex his comedic muscles in front of entertainers and members of the media, an opportunity he used to make jokes about his predecessor\u2019s recent scandals.Biden joked he was offered $10 to keep his speech under ten minutes. \u201cThat\u2019s a switch, a president being offered hush money,\u201d he quipped in reference to Trump\u2019s indictment in an alleged hush money scheme.In just the last two weeks, the media industry has been hit by multiple high-profile terminations, layoffs and the complete shut down of a news organization.Host Tucker Carlson and Fox News. Anchor Don Lemon and CNN. Comcast announced NBCUniversal CEO Jeff Shell was leaving company after an outside investigation \u201cinto a complaint of inappropriate conduct.\u201d Vice Media announced layoffs and the cancellation of its acclaimed program \u201cVice News Tonight.\u201d BuzzFeed News.The event raises funds for the White House Correspondents\u2019 Association scholarship fund and offers a rare opportunity for journalists and politicians to rub elbows \u2013 but also features remarks from a comedian often tasked with walking a fine line between gentle ribbing and legitimate criticism.This year\u2019s dinner headliner was \u201cDaily Show\u201d correspondent Roy Wood Jr., who took aim at both parties and the media as he criticized politics in Washington.As Biden stepped away from the podium to make room for Wood, the comedian quipped: \u201cReal quick, Mr. President. I think you left some of your classified documents up here,\u201d in reference to the classified documents found in Biden\u2019s Delaware home.Wood also joked about Fox News\u2019 settlement with Dominion Voting Systems, the oustings of Carlson and Lemon, the ethics scandal around Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, and Trump, who he dubbed the \u201cking of scandals.\u201d\u201cKeeping up with Trump scandals is like watching Star Wars movies,\u201d he said. \u201cYou got to watch the third one to understand the first one, then you got \u2013 you can\u2019t miss the second one because it\u2019s got Easter eggs for the fifth one.\u201dIn 2018, comedian Michelle Wolf drew fire after she delivered a brutal monologue taking the Trump administration to task for its positions on abortion, press access and coverage of the beleaguered White House.This year\u2019s dinner comes weeks afterto end the national emergency for Covid-19. Attendees were still required to submit proof of a negative Covid test before the event.Last year\u2019s dinner was the first time the gala had been held.Biden was the first president to address the dinner\u2019s attendees in six years, after former President Donald Trump famously boycotted the event throughout his tenure in office.Biden last yearto loudly affirm his belief in a free press \u2013 a bold contrast to a predecessor who labeled reporters the \u201cenemy of the people.\u201d"

        "link": "https://edition.cnn.com/2023/04/23/politics/national-abortion-ban-house-republicans/index.html",
        "text": "House Republicans are abandoning a years-long push by their party to pass a federal abortion ban and are exploring other ways to advance their anti-abortion agenda \u2013 a remarkable shift that underscores how the GOP is wrestling with an issue that hasfor their party.In interviews with dozens of Republicans, the vast majority \u2013 even among the staunchest opponents of abortion\u2013 rejected the idea of Congress pursuing a national ban and said leadership has no plans on the horizon for it to be a centerpiece of their agenda, despite passing federal restrictions on the procedure in previous years when they were in power.Republicans say there\u2019s a practical reason for their change in stance: After Roe v. Wade was overturned last summer, they argue that the question of whether to ban abortion is now best left to the states \u2013 a position that effectively, and perhaps conveniently, parks congressional Republicans on the sidelines of the national debate.\u201cYou know, it works through committee, the Supreme Court has made that decision, it goes to the states, and states will take up that issue,\u201d House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, a California Republican, said at a recent press conference when asked by CNN whether the House GOP will move any legislation on the matter.Texas Sen. John Cornyn, a member of GOP leadership who has previously voted for abortion bans, expressed a similar sentiment: \u201cI am proud of the votes I cast \u2026 but I don\u2019t think it is appropriate for us now after Roe has been overruled to do this from Washington, D.C.\u201dBehind the scenes, Republicans acknowledge that the abortion ruling, Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization, hurt the GOP in the midterm elections and they\u2019re worried about a similar backlash in 2024 if they embrace a federal ban now that they\u2019re in power.It\u2019s an eye-popping pivot for a party that has spent the last five decades ingratiating itself with the religious right, promising to use every lever of government to advance the anti-abortion cause. But it reflects a growing divide in the movement itself as advocates, where states are serving as the test labs for laws rather than Congress.There is a political risk, however, in letting states be in the driver\u2019s seat. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis signed a six-week abortion ban earlier this month and other states have outright banned the procedure, while a legal fight is playing out in the courts about whether women should continue to have access to a commonly used abortion pill. That\u2019s fueling fears over whether these developments could be a drag on the entire Republican ticket next year, regardless of how hard congressional Republicans try to avoid questions about the matter.GOP Rep. Nancy Mace of South Carolina \u2013 who represents a swing district and has been vocal about what she calls her party\u2019s failure to effectively message on abortion \u2013 argued it\u2019s not enough for Republicans to simply ignore the issue. She is pushing for legislation to expand access to birth control and speed up law enforcement\u2019s backlog of rape kits in an effort to show voters the GOP cares about protecting women\u2019s health care. GOP leadership is open to bringing legislation to the floor on the latter issue, according to Republican sources, if it can make it through the committee process.\u201cYou can be pro-life and you can be pro-woman. The two are not mutually exclusive,\u201d Mace told reporters. \u201cWe will not win the popular vote in \u201924 if we continue down this path of extremism.\u201dBut not every Republican agrees. Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, the leading sponsor of a national 15-week abortion ban, is calling on his colleagues to have the \u201ccourage\u201d to, exposing the lingering divisions in the GOP over the hot-button issue.\u201cI hope the Republican Party can muster the courage to oppose late-term abortion like we have done in the past. My legislation is a good place to start,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cLike always, it includes exceptions for cases of rape, incest, and life of the mother. The Republican Party must be the party which values, cherishes, and protects life.\u201dWhen Republicans controlled the House, they passed The Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act, which would ban abortions after the 20th week of pregnancy, in  2012, 2015, and 2017.After Roe was overturned last summer, the bill\u2019s lead sponsor \u2013 Rep. Chris Smith of New Jersey \u2013 said he planned to make the legislation even more restrictive by lowering it to 15 weeks. The idea attracted support from top Republicans, including McCarthy, at the time, though leadership never specifically committed to putting on the bill on the floor.But after the midterms produced, there now appears to be little appetite inside the House GOP for such a bill. Smith has yet to reintroduce his legislation in this session of Congress, and even when he does, sources say, leadership has no intention of putting it on the floor. And it\u2019s clear that some of the party\u2019s most vulnerable members would be uncomfortable with, if not outright opposed to, such a bill.New York freshman GOP Rep. Mike Lawler, who flipped his district from Democratic control and helped deliver the Republican majority, said he does not support a federal abortion ban but was also critical of Democrats\u2019 position on the issue.\u201cI think the extremes in both parties are wrong on this. Most Americans believe that there is a reasonable time period, and it generally falls in the first trimester,\u201d Lawler told CNN. \u201cWhen you look at this issue, most people want reasonableness and they want a rational discussion on it.\u201dRep. David Valadao of California, one of the 18 Republicans who represents a Biden-won district, sought to avoid the subject altogether. \u201cNo comment,\u201d he said when asked about Florida\u2019s six-week ban.GOP Rep. Don Bacon, whose Nebraska district also voted for Biden, told CNN, \u201cThe states are the center of gravity on all of these debates. I think that\u2019s what Dobbs made possible.\u201dConservative lawmakers shared a similar view.Rep. Troy Nehls, a Republican from Texas, told CNN: \u201cit\u2019s up to the states,\u201d when asked about a national ban. Freshman GOP Rep. Anna Paulina Luna of Florida agreed, saying, \u201cI think it\u2019s a states\u2019 rights decision. I\u2019m personally pro-life.\u201dSen. Ted Cruz, a Republican from Texas, said: \u201cThe result of the Dobbs decision is that decisions about abortion will be made at the state level by the voters.\u201dAnd Sen. Josh Hawley, a Republican from Missouri who identifies as \u201c100% pro-life\u201d and signed on last year to a bill to ban abortions after 15 weeks, argued that Congress needs to be sensitive to where the American public is on the issue and that a six-week ban doesn\u2019t have that kind of support.\u201cMy own view? I wish there weren\u2019t abortions except for rape, incest and life of the mother, but do I think we should impose that ban at that level here now? I don\u2019t, because that is not the national consensus,\u201d Hawley said. \u201cVoters are weighing in in state after state. Let\u2019s let them do that unless there is a really broad consensus.\u201dTheir position is in line with that of former President Donald Trump, who also\u2013 a comment that prompted the ire of the anti-abortion group Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, which is pushing for presidential nominees to endorse a 15-week ban.Cornyn touched on the confusion after last summer\u2019s court ruling, saying, \u201cI think there is some confusion among the pro-life community as to what exactly we were asking for. In Roe versus Wade, we were asking that we go get the authority back to the states, and now people want to continue the fight here in Washington, and I disagree with that approach.\u201dIn the absence of pursuing a federal ban, and under pressure from powerful anti-abortion groups, Republicans have sought to deliver on the issue in other ways.Earlier this year, the House passed two messaging bills related to abortion: one that would require health care providers to try to preserve the life of an infant in the rare case that a fetus is born alive during or after an attempted abortion, something that is already required, and another that condemns \u201crecent attacks on pro-life facilities, groups and churches.\u201dBoth measures, which are going nowhere in the Democratic-controlled Senate, were seen as low-hanging fruit.Meanwhile, a narrow bill prohibiting the use of federal funds for abortions that House Majority Leader Steve Scalise of Louisiana promised would get a vote in the first two weeks of the Republican majority has still not been scheduled.Now, lawmakers are largely turning their energy to the appropriations process, and specifically the efforts to reenact, which blocks federal funds from being used for most abortions except in cases of rape, incest or when the woman\u2019s life is in danger.While the amendment is annually included in spending bills, groups like Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America and the National Right to Life Committee are pushing GOP leadership to put a bill on the floor that would make the provision permanent.The National Right to Life Committee said it is in regular communication with House Republican leadership about possible legislative efforts and educational needs on the issue.\u201cWhat we\u2019re working on right now is primarily reacquainting members with the abortion issue after the Dobbs decision. This is a very dramatically different landscape,\u201d the group\u2019s federal legislative director, Jennifer Popik, told CNN.Popik, who characterized her organization\u2019s goals as \u201cincremental,\u201d acknowledged that after the Dobbs decision, \u201ceverybody became sort of concerned\u201d about what options were no longer available.E.V. Osment, vice president of communications for Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, is advising Republican lawmakers to not shy away from the topic, arguing it can be a political winner for them if they go on offense and highlight exactly where they stand.\u201cIt is imperative that Republicans stand up and speak out on this and not let their opponents define them,\u201d Osment said. \u201cRepublican candidates excel when they expose their opponents\u2019 no-limits approach to abortion.\u201d"

        "text": "For people who write about electoral, or \u201chorse race,\u201d politics, few things are more enjoyable than an exciting.Sometimes, both Democrats and Republicans cooperate by holding gripping fights for the party nods (see 2008). Sometimes, however, voters in both parties quickly coalesce around front-runners (see 2000).A look at thein both parties suggests 2024 could be one of the most, if not the most, boring primary cycles in the last 50 years.Nothing is set in stone. Things can change when you least expect it, but it\u2019s tough not to acknowledge the current facts.Let\u2019s start on the Democratic side, whereisthat he is running for reelection. No incumbent president has lost a state primary (where he was on the ballot).Robert F. Kennedy Jr. can't count on family support to take on BidenAt this point, Biden doesn\u2019t look likely to break that streak. He hasn\u2019t attracted a challenger who would be considered serious under most metrics. Neithernorhas ever held elected office. Williamsonduring her 2020 presidential bid. Kennedy pushesabout vaccine safety and is seeking votes from an electorate that isagainst Covid-19.The very limited polling so far shows Biden with a large advantage over Williamson and Kennedy.Perhaps more importantly, few Democratic elected officialsanything other than loyalty to a 2024 Biden bid. That\u2019s key for a few reasons.First, primary endorsementsat this point of primary success.Second, it\u2019s true that Democratic primary votersthey are open to listening to a credible challenger to Biden. The president, after all, would be 82 years old at the start of a potential second term.But as Billy Preston once sang, \u201cNothin\u2019 from nothin\u2019 leaves nothin\u2019.\u201d That polling hypothetical means nothing if no one with a base within the party runs.Biden\u2019samong Democrats is well in line withwho cruised to renomination. So it\u2019s not like Democratic voters will be kicking and screaming if they have to support Biden for another term.On the Republican side, formerfinds himself in his best position in a very long time to win the GOP nomination.I\u2019m unaware of anational or early-voting-state-level poll that shows Trump with anything other than a \u201cbig league\u201d edge over both declared and potential 2024 opponents. He\u2019s regularly at around 50% in national surveys.Why Trump is still favored for the GOP nomination, despite his indictmentThis 50% is key because it\u2019s so rare for someone to be polling at that level at thisand not win the nomination. Bob Dole in 1996, George W. Bush in 2000, Al Gore in 2000 and Hillary Clinton in 2016 were the sole candidates running in incumbent-free primaries who were near, at or above 50% in early national polling.All four of them were able to secure the nominations with relative ease, and Clinton was the only one who lost more than a handful of primary contests.For an example of someone polling like Trump is now and then losing the party nomination, you have to look at primaries involving an incumbent. Ted Kennedy lost the 1980 Democratic primary to President Jimmy Carter, despite easily leading him in polling at this point in the cycle.It\u2019s possible that since Trump is the first former president to actively seek a presidential nomination in over 80 years, the early national polling means less than it normally does.That said, Trump has more going for him than national polling. For one thing, his early-state-level polling looks as good as it has in a while. Areleased last week puts him up 20 points onin a hypothetical Granite State GOP primary, after he trailed the Florida governor by 12 points in January.This polling is supported by something that eluded Trump when he first ran for the presidency in 2015: endorsements from elected officials. Trump didn\u2019t get his first one from a governor or member of Congress until after winning his first primary contest during the 2016 cycle.This time around, Trump already has over 60 endorsements from governors and members of Congress. Since 1980, candidates with comparable collections of gubernatorial and congressional endorsements at this point in the cycle have all gone on to win their parties\u2019 nominations.DeSantis allies prepare for financial show of force as Florida governor seeks to overcome early stumblesMost impressive is what Trump has done in Florida. DeSantis would be Trump\u2019s most serious challenger by far if he decides to run. He\u2019s the only one breaking into double digits in the average national and early-state polling.Yet Trump has gone into Florida andfrom a majority of Republicans in the state\u2019s US House delegation. Some of those endorsements aren\u2019t surprising (e.g., Rep. Matt Gaetz). Some of them are notable, such as Rep., whoat his 2022 reelection victory party.Trump, like Biden, seems to have two things going for him: a large share of Republican voters and the party behind him. If those two were in opposition to each other, the primary season would have looked far more interesting.So unless something changes, we\u2019re looking at a recipe for primary success for both the current president and the man he succeeded."

        "text": "Editor\u2019s Note:The US government iswith proposals aimed at banning TikTok, the viral video platform used by. Officials say it\u2019s a matter of national security, gesturing urgently toward TikTok\u2019s parent companyand its ties to China.While some might be motivated by thinly-veiled xenophobia, lawmakers also rightlyabout TikTok\u2019s surveillance and capitalist business model, which vacuums up as much personal information about users as possible and then uses it to serve content that keeps us clicking, scrolling, and generating ad revenue. TikTok \u201cspies\u201d on us for profit. That\u2019s not in question.The problem is that \u2013 while they might not be owned by a Chinese company \u2013 Instagram, YouTube, Facebook, Snapchat and Twitter all, as privacy advocates have been warning for more than a decade. Banning TikTok won\u2019t make us safer from China\u2019s surveillance operations. Nor will it protect children, or anyone else, from getting addicted to Big Tech\u2019s manipulative products. It\u2019s just an ineffective solution that sounds good on TV.What Americans think of a TikTok banWhile many governmentsand surveillance, China certainly has one of the most sophisticated and draconian systems. A core characteristic of China\u2019s censorship regime is the \u201cGreat Firewall,\u201dforeign social media apps, news sites and even educational resources like Wikipedia, under the guise of protecting national security.As they hyperventilate about TikTok, US politicians are so eager to appear \u201ctough on China\u201d that they\u2019re suggesting we build our very own Great Firewall here at home. There is anumber of countries in the world so authoritarian that they block popular apps and websites entirely. It\u2019s regrettable that so many US lawmakers want to add us to that list.Several of the proposals wending their way through Congress would grant the federal government unprecedented new powers to control what technology we can use and how we can express ourselves \u2013 authority that goes far beyond TikTok. The bipartisan RESTRICT Act (), for example, would enable the Commerce Department to engage in extraordinary acts of policing, criminalizing a wide range of activities with companies from \u201chostile\u201d countries and potentially even banning entire apps simply by declaring them a threat to national security.Opinion: Utah's startling new rules for kids and social mediaThe law is vague enough that some experts havethat it could threaten individual internet users with lengthy prison sentences for taking steps to \u201cevade\u201d a ban, like(i.e., bypassing approved app distribution channels such as the Apple store) or using a virtual private network (VPN).But banning TikTok isn\u2019t just foolish and dangerous, it\u2019s also unconstitutional. The strong free speech protections enshrined in the First Amendmentfrom extreme actions like criminalizing an app that millions of people use to express their opinions and ideas. The US government can\u2019t ban you from posting or watching TikTok videos any more than they can stop you from reading a foreign newspaper like the Times of India or writing an opinion piece for The Guardian.The Washington Post, the New York Times and CNN all have their own official TikTok accounts, as do numerous candidates for office, elected officials, academics, journalists, religious leaders and political figures. Any proposal that results in TikTok\u2019s effective ban in the US would almost certainly fall apart under a legal challenge, as theandhave asserted. Even conservative Republican Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky agrees that banning the app would violate Americans\u2019 right to free speech.A ban on TikTok wouldn\u2019t even be effective: The Chinese government could purchase much of the same information from, which are largely unregulated in the US.TikTok users are making fun of Congress members for their questions to app CEO Shou ChewThe rush to ban TikTok \u2013 or force its sale to a US company \u2013 is a convenient distraction from what our elected officials should be doing to protect us from government manipulation and commercial surveillance: passing basic data privacy legislation. It\u2019s a matter ofthat Instagram, YouTube, Venmo, Snapchat and most of the other apps on your phone engage in similarbusiness practices to TikTok. Some are.So it\u2019s not just TikTok.in the digital space on all of your devices is tracked. Companies that engage in the practice claim that they track users\u2019 activities online in orderMany companiesthey harvest to third parties, who sell it to fourth and fifth and sixth parties. While companies collect this data for the purpose of extracting profit and getting users hooked on their products, governments have long taken an interest.The only way to stop governments from weaponizing data that private companies like TikTok collect and store about us is to stop those companies from collecting and storing so much information in the first place. You can\u2019t do that with censorship. You do that by passing a strong national data privacy law that bans companies from collecting more data about us than they need to provide us with the service we\u2019ve requested.Opinion: When it comes to TikTok, the US is blindInstead of helping Big Tech get bigger by banning a major competitor, Congress should also passto crack down on anti-competitive practices. That would give concerned parents and internet users who want to ditch TikTok and Instagram better options to choose from, and reduce the power of the largest platforms, making them harder for governments to exploit and manipulate. It\u2019s much harder for bad actors, whether they\u2019re corporate trolls or government agents, to control information across a constellation of smaller platforms, each with their own rules and algorithms, than it is for them to poison the well when there are a tiny handful of companies controlling access to information.A separate concern that lawmakers and US officialsis the idea that the Chinese government could pressure TikTok to amplify propaganda, or otherwise change its algorithm to advance the government\u2019s interests. It\u2019s an argument that\u2019s not entirely without merit.We know the Russian government was effective in manipulating information onduring the 2016 elections. The US has historically engaged inoverseas. Consider, for example, the US history inin Latin America  or disinformation campaigns byafter the Arab Spring. State-backed disinformation campaigns are happening at a mass scale and on every major platform. We fight that by demanding more transparency and accountability, not more censorship.It\u2019s a national embarrassment that we have no basic data privacy law in the United States. And it\u2019s a travesty that we continue to allow unregulated tech monopolies to trample our rights. Every day that our elected officials spend wringing their hands and spreading moral panic about what the kids are doing on TikTok is another day we\u2019re left vulnerable and unprotected.With any luck, Washington\u2019s TikTok hysteria will fade quickly. Let\u2019s hope the next hot new trend in the nation\u2019s capital is passing actual laws that protect people, starting with strong privacy and antitrust legislation."

The NRA is now in a fight for survival amid lines of credit that appear to beandover the group\u2019s future. Meanwhile, Democrats \u2014 once wary ofat all \u2014 have finally rediscovered their voice.Democrats\u2019 aggressive new tack on guns was on full display outside the House chamber earlier this month, where onlookers recorded Rep. Jamaal Bowman of New YorkRepublicanof Kentucky. That incident would have made Bowman a pariah in the Democratic Party of 2007, when then-Majority Leader Steny Hoyer punted on introducingimmediately after the mass shooting at Virginia Tech.Hoyer appears in Bowman\u2019s video, too. This time he\u2019s offering his incensed colleague a supportive pat on the back. Times have certainly changed.Democrats\u2019 rising confidence in fighting for gun reform comes against a backdrop of tireless coalition-building fromand community organizers across the country. Many are young people defined \u2014 not of their choice \u2014 by their relationship to gun violence. They talk about theirlike combat veterans describing old tours of duty.in 2012.in 2018.in 2022. Now their advocacy organizations are helping to reshape public opinion on America\u2019s relationship to guns.Given the NRA\u2019s reduced bankroll, \u201cright now all the NRA can offer is a stamp of approval\u201d to pro-gun Republican candidates, Susan Del Percio, an adviser to Republican candidates and the founder of Del Percio Strategies, told me. \u201cMeanwhile groups like Everytown for Gun Safety and their partners have had aacross the country. They have, and have people on the ground.\u201dOpinion: The reality of gun violence in the US is bleak, but history shows it's not hopelessGun control activists got there by adopting an approach: Instead of focusing solely on federal reforms, gun safety advocates have invested heavily in influencing state and local policy. Everytown credits at leastpassed in 2022 to their state-by-state strategy. During the same cycle, Moms Demand Action says it electedto office at every level of government.After a full generation suffering under the ever-present threat of domestic mass murder, the American people might finally have reached a breaking point. Seventy-one percent of, according to a recent AP-NORC poll.

Far from dooming her with voters, Whitmer and her tough line on guns has national media outlets now speculating that she may be positioning herself for an.Washington state has been just as busy, withapproving measures to hold the firearms industry accountable for gun violence and prohibit the manufacture and sale of assault weapons. In other cases, governors are leading the charge by resisting efforts to prop up the gun lobby. In Arizona, Democratic Gov. Katie Hobbs vetoed a bill that would have effectively.All of that activity has drawn Republican attention, not least because the GOP has yet to come up with a compelling counterargument to popular Democratic gun safety proposals. Even Republican voters part company with the GOP on the subject: An AP-NORC poll conducted last year found that nearly half of self-identified Republican voters supported passing.\u201cRepublicans look completely unreasonable when they won\u2019t even discuss background checks, gun safety measures like storage or red flag laws,\u201d Del Percio warned. \u201cRepublicans running in,and, all big Second Amendment states, all lost.

John Cornyn of Texas has said Congressfollowing the bipartisan passage of a limited gun safety bill last year.Opinion: Why expelling me from the legislature backfired on Tennessee RepublicansBut even with their heels dug in federally, some Republican governors are belatedly warming to once unimaginable gun reforms.

That\u2019s a sea change from just two years ago, when Lee personally thanked the NRA for its help.For progressive activists finally tasting victory, there is a growing fear that the Democratic Party will eventually get in its own way. Last month, Democrats close to President Joe Biden made clear that his 2024 campaign wouldthorny \u201cculture war\u201d issues, including abortion and guns. But a slate ofpublicized by the White House last month hints that Biden\u2019s view may be evolving as Democratic state-level wins roll in.As Democrats head into a bruising 2024, they should remember that the American people decisively support Democratic proposals for addressing the scourge of gun violence. Political watchers who criticized Democrats forduring the 2022 midterm elections later ate crow after that once-dreaded culture war topic.Democrats\u2019 abortion-driven ballot victories confirmed that social issues still have the power to reshape electoral patterns. That includes gun reform. Biden and the Democrats have the rare opportunity to build yet another winning coalition out of an issue once viewed as political poison. They need only look to their party\u2019s hardworking governors for a roadmap to electoral success in 2024."

We\u2019re looking back at the strongest, smartestof the week from CNN and other outlets.King Henry IV comes on stage in a nightgown, wondering why sleep eludes him. He imagines a boy sitting \u201cupon the high and giddy mast\u201d of a ship tossed by wind and waves. Why can that \u201csea-boy\u201d sleep through the storm while in the \u201ccalmest and most stillest\u201d night, a king cannot doze in his bed?\u201cUneasy lies the head that wears a crown,\u201d concludes the king.The week ended with the crowning of King Charles III \u2014 the UK\u2019s first coronation in 70 years. Despite the pageantry, he and many of the world\u2019s other royals have been reduced to figureheads, with today\u2019s great powers mostly ruled by a mix of democratically elected and authoritarian officials.With that power, comes anxiety \u2014 and for some it was a particularly tense week. In Ukraine, leaders prepared for their long-anticipated spring offensive, seeking to drive out the invaders. Russia said that President Vladimir Putin was the intended target of a foiled Ukrainian drone attack on the Kremlin, an allegation Ukraine denied. To add to Putin\u2019s woes, warlord Yevgeny Prighozin threatened to pull his Wagner Group forces out of the killing field of Bakhmut, blaming the Russian military establishment for denying them support. \u201cThe dead and wounded \u2014 and that\u2019s tens of thousands of men \u2014 lie on the conscience of those who did not give us ammunition,\u201d he said.In the US, President Joe Biden and House Speaker Kevin McCarthy are bracing for a crucial meeting Tuesday as the country stares down the threat of a financially devastating default in just a few weeks. Biden is battling low approval ratings as he seeks reelection in a country that, according to the polls, doesn\u2019t want a rematch between Biden and former President Donald Trump and has a sour view of the economy.

And\u00a0if he continues to poll well above his opponents, he won\u2019t feel the need to grant them opportunities to gain more exposure,\u201d wrote Zelizer.In Wisconsin\u2019s election last month for a pivotal state Supreme Court seat,\u2019s nonprofit VoteAmerica reached out to students on 24 campuses, placing ads, tacking up posters and partnering with student influencers. \u201cAll these communications channels combined to share a simple message: Election Day was April 4.\u201dYouth turnout soared, Cleaver wrote. \u201cThe city of Eau Claire\u2019s Ward 20, which covers the upper campus of the University of Wisconsin-Eau Claire,\u00a0saw the highest turnout\u00a0in all of Eau Claire\u2019s 77 voting wards, with votes up more than 400% over a state Supreme Court election just four years earlier. \u2026 For VoteAmerica, this seemed like a clear win for democracy.\u201dNot everyone has been pleased by the rise in student voting, with some taking action to make it harder for young people to cast their ballots.\u201cAround the country,\u00a0Republican-controlled states are targeting the youth vote,with a particular focus on college voters \u2014,\u201d Cleaver observed.A mass shooting in Cleveland, Texas, led to a four-day manhunt that ended Tuesday. Aswrote, the alleged shooter \u201cwas taken into custody\u00a0on charges of\u00a0fatally shooting five people. The killings\u00a0allegedly\u00a0took place after the suspect was asked\u00a0to stop firing his gun outside near a neighbor\u2019s home to avoid waking a child.\u201dStewart recalled \u201cthe time my husband and I asked our then-next-door neighbors to stop shooting at songbirds in the backyard. What happened next? Well, they stopped. That evening, one of them even surprised us by coming by to apologize.\u201d\u201cBut when the response to asking someone not to shoot an AR-15 at 11 at night, near other people\u2019s houses, while a baby is sleeping,\u00a0might be\u00a0mass murder?\u00a0I\u2019m not sure how we move forward from that.\u201dThe leaders of the Church of England saw it as an egalitarian move \u2013 replacing the traditional pledge of allegiance that only a select few make to a new king with an invitation allowing anyone to swear fealty to King Charles III.It didn\u2019t come across as intended, wrote. \u201cTo many of the King\u2019s subjects in Britain and abroad, the invitation (no one will be required to give the pledge) has struck a tone-deaf chord.\u201d The notion wasn\u2019t viewed in the same way as the US pledge of allegiance recited by children every school day.That pledge \u201cis to a republic. For British spectators, and particularly for younger viewers whose views about the future of the monarchy are uncertain or conflicted, the significance of the coronation is more complex.\u201d\u201cby inviting people\u00a0to pledge allegiance to the crown.\u201d (Responding to the outcry, the Church of England gave people the option of saying instead, \u201cGod save King Charles.\u201d)The oil that was used to anoint the king has an ingredient that harks back to a little-known part of his family history \u2013 the role played by his paternal grandmother Princess Alice in hiding a Jewish family from the Nazis during the German occupation of Greece in World War II. Aswrote, some of the olives used to produce the oil were harvested from the Monastery of Mary Magdalene, where Princess Alice is buried.\u201cIn 1993, Alice was given the high honor of being named a Righteous Among the Nations by the Yad Vashem Holocaust memorial in Israel for her heroism.\u00a0The fate of the Greek Jews was among the worst in Europe, with more than 90%\u00a0perishing.\u201dThe jeweled gold crown that was placed on the head of King Charles III Saturday. It was modeled on an even older one, which was melted down when the monarchy was briefly abolished during the English Civil War.The unfortunate monarch who was the last to own the original St. Edward\u2019s Crown, King Charles I, was convicted of treason and beheaded on January 30, 1649. Moments before he was executed, he, \u201cI go from a corruptible to an incorruptible crown; where no disturbance can be, no disturbance in the world.\u201dWell-wishers at yesterday\u2019s coronation cheered Charles, who can anticipate a much less tumultuous reign than that of the first king of his name.Other views on the coronation:::US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen warned last week that the US might have to default on its debts by the beginning of June unless Congress raises the debt limit., who held that job during the Obama administration, wrote, \u201cThe risk of defaulting on America\u2019s debt is even greater today than it was in 2011, when I was director of the White House Office of Management and Budget, and in 2013, when I was secretary of the Treasury. Washington is even more polarized, and House Republicans\u2019 demands are more extreme. The House passed a bill last month that they know is unacceptable to both the Senate and the White House, yet some House Republicans say that they will not support a less extreme final bill.\u201dLew wrote.There is an economic crisis \u2013 but it involves the finance industry. Small banks are getting squeezed by the fear companies have of losing deposits in a bank run. So far regulators have protected deposits above the $250,000 cap, but there\u2019s no guarantee that will continue. To avoid the continued rise of megabanks such as JP Morgan Chase, law and finance professoradvocates lifting the cap on deposit insurance.\u201cThe only alternative, as we watch small bank deposits continue their exodus to JP Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon\u2019s welcoming Wall Street arms, is\u201dFor more:::::::::College costs are rising, right? That bit of conventional wisdom may actually be misleading, according to, an expert on higher education finance.\u201cThe \u2018sticker price\u2019 of college has\u00a0almost tripled\u00a0over the past 40 years,\u201d Levine wrote. \u201cHow many students can afford\u00a0$30,000 to attend a public four-year institution, let alone more than\u00a0$80,000 to attend an elite private institution?\u201d Levine, who has has done some new research into the reality behind those numbers, points out that only students from higher-income families pay the sticker price.\u201cMost students\u00a0receive financial aid and pay less than that, often\u00a0considerably less. And the amount they pay is\u00a0actually falling, not rising.. That is the problem we need to solve.\u201d"

He is the author and editor of 25 books, including the New York Times best-seller, \u201c\u201d (Basic Books). Follow him on Twitter. The views expressed in this commentary are his own. Viewon CNN.In one of the best scenes thus far from season four of HBO\u2019s \u201cSuccession,\u201d Logan Roy, the conservative media tycoon played by Brian Cox, unexpectedly joins his four adult children in a karaoke bar to try to salvage a business deal that three of them are subverting. He also says he is there to offer them an apology. (HBO, like CNN, is owned by Warner Bros. Discovery.)But when the ensuing conversation doesn\u2019t go his way, he unleashes on them, declaring, \u201cYou are not serious figures. I love you, but you are not serious people.\u201dThe line is powerful \u2014 and may just capture the way President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris are approaching the declared and expected GOP candidates ahead of the 2024 campaign.For months, itwhether Biden would run for reelection. And while he finally confirmed this week that he plans to run, the president said he\u2019sOpinion: Don't count DeSantis out yet; the GOP's 2024 race is far from overBy choosing to lie low while Republicans are gearing up for 2024, Biden is employing his version of what has become known as thewhereby the incumbent campaigns by focusing on the business of being president and shows voters that he is the responsible figure in the race.The president\u2019s understated strategy makes room for Republicans to,andwhile he remains above the fray for as long as possible. This strategy makes the GOP the focus of the election, allowing Biden to reinforce his message from 2020: do voters want someone who will govern and act in a serious manner or do they want a circus?Among the GOP candidates, former President Donald Trump was the first tofive months ago. But Trump has dominated the media airwaves in recent weeks \u2014 and not for the reasons many Republican voters might be hoping for. The indictment in New York on charges of falsifying business records has raised more questions about his commitment, or lack thereof, to the rule of law. And this legal case is one of many. From acentering on allegations of rape and defamation to the case in Georgia centering on his effort to overturn the presidential election, Trump might just be claiming the title of presidential candidate in the greatest legal peril \u2014 ever. (Trump has denied wrongdoing in all cases.)Given the way that Trump loves to pit himself against his opponents and use conflict to his advantage, he is embracing his outlaw image rather than trying to move away from it. Recently, he said that he wouldeven if he is criminally convicted.Meanwhile, former UN Ambassador Nikki Haley and Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina are both trying to claim the non-Trump lane as Republicans are watching and waiting for Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis to make his move.Opinion: Sen. Dianne Feinstein's dilemma is a reminder of this universal questionWhile DeSantis has the best chance of challenging Trump in the primaries at this point, he is also fueling the image of a party that is more focused on stoking outrage by taking radical positions in the culture wars than on the big issues of the day. And by recently signing Florida\u2019s, DeSantis, along with so many other Republicans, is taking an extreme position on reproductive rights thatBiden and Harris seem to be betting that in the coming months, the Republicans can do much more damage to themselves than Democrats could ever do by railing against them. Let Republicans be Republicans and show, to borrow Roy\u2019s words, that they are \u201cnot serious people.\u201dDoing so has the potential, in their minds, to create room for a campaign that shows Biden and Harris as the adults in the room. And should the nation be rocked by uncertainty \u2014 whether that comes in the form of rising geopolitical tensions, economic turmoil or a natural disaster \u2014 a majority of voters could choose to back Biden, thinking it\u2019s best not to change ships mid-stream, especially when the other ship looks like it might not be able to sail for very long. While Trump is fighting legal case after legal case, Biden is working on policies such asand Harris is.To be sure, the \u201cRose Garden strategy\u201d has failed before \u2014 Presidents Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter, a Republican and a Democrat, used this tactic in 1976 and 1980 and both lost their respective reelection campaigns.But these are different times and this is a different Republican Party. The more the GOP chaos remains front and center, the more independent and moderate voters will be left wondering if the party can be trusted to regain the reins of power in the West Wing.Biden might be boring and fly under the radar much of the time, but that is the image of normality that helped him win in 2020. It\u2019s the image that helped Democrats do unusually well in the 2022 midterm elections, and it\u2019s the image that might very well help him secure a second term in 2024."

I have accepted that advice.\u201dThe organization declared the coronavirus outbreak to be ain January 2020, about six weeks before characterizing it as a pandemic.A PHEIC creates an agreement between countries to abide by WHO\u2019s recommendations for managing the emergency.

Countries use them to marshal resources and waive rules in order to ease a crisis.The United States is set to let itson May 11.Covid-19 continues to spread, the virus is evolving and remains a global health threat, but at a lower level of concern, according to WHO officials.\u201cThere\u2019s still a public health threat out there, and we all see that every day in terms of the evolution of this virus, in terms of its global presence, its continued evolution and continued vulnerabilities in our communities, both societal vulnerabilities, age vulnerabilities, protection vulnerabilities, and many other things,\u201d said Dr. Mike Ryan, executive director of WHO\u2019s Health Emergencies Programme.\u201cSo, we fully expect that this virus will continue to transmit, but this is the history of pandemics,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cIn most cases, pandemics truly end when the next pandemic begins. I know that\u2019s a terrible thought but that is the history of pandemics.\u201dThese benefits will disappear when Biden ends the Covid national and public health emergencies in MayDr. Maria Van Kerkhove, WHO\u2019s Covid-19 technical lead and head of its program on emerging disease, said that the emergency phase of the Covid-19 crisis is over but the disease is \u201chere to stay\u201d and the coronavirus that causes the disease is not going away any time soon.\u201cWhile we\u2019re not in the crisis mode, we can\u2019t let our guard down,\u201d Van Kerkhove said. \u201cEpidemiologically, this virus will continue to cause waves. What we are hopeful of is that we have the tools in place to ensure that the future waves do not result in more severe disease, don\u2019t result in waves of death and we can do that with the tools we have at hand. We just need to make sure that we are tracking the virus because it will continue to evolve.\u201dThere have been more than 765 million confirmed Covid-19 cases since the start of the pandemic, according to. Nearly 7 million people have died. Europe has had the most confirmed cases overall, but the Americas have reported the most deaths. About 1 in 6 total deaths have been in the US.Cases peaked in December 2022 as Omicron swept the globe, hitting the Western Pacific particularly hard. But billions of vaccine doses have been administered globally, and deaths have remained far below previous peaks.Now, Covid-19 cases and deaths are about the lowest they\u2019ve been in three years. Still, more than 3,500 people died in the last week of April and billions remain unvaccinated.every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.Tedros said that, if needed, he would not hesitate to convene another emergency committee meeting and declare a global health emergency again if there is a significant rise in Covid-19 cases or deaths in the future.\u201cCovid-19 has left and continues to leave deep scars on our world. Those scars must serve as a permanent reminder of the potential for new viruses to emerge with devastating consequences,\u201d Tedros said.\u201cOne of the greatest tragedies of Covid-19 is that it didn\u2019t have to be this way. We have the tools and technologies to prepare for pandemics better, detect them earlier, respond to them faster, and communicate their impact. But globally, a lack of coordination, a lack of equity, and lack of solidarity meant that those tools were not used as effectively as they could have been,\u201d Tedros said. \u201cWe must promise ourselves and our children and grandchildren that we will never make those mistakes again.\u201d"

Facing those sometimes harrowing experiences on the job did.During the course of my day-to-day, I was introduced to police tactics that I employed to fit each incident I faced. I learned the policy and procedure, rules and guidelines that I used to carry out my responsibilities.In the past few days, we have felt the heartbreak of learning that Wilt was gravely injured in the line of duty while trying to save innocent lives. And just a few weeks ago, we also saw what the American police officer can do when equipped with the right training, the right equipment and most importantly, the right mindset.While school shootings spread fear, there is some comforting data on school violenceAt alast month, officers responded to an active shooter who had taken the lives of teachers and their young students. They entered immediately with no regard for their own safety and shot and killed the assailant. This is the job.As was the case in Louisville and Tennessee, men and women just like us are asked to set aside their own personal safety to maintain order in our \u201ccivilized society.\u201d I will never say that police are above reproach and that reforms are not needed in our criminal justice system, but I will say that the actions of these brave officers are the rule and not the exception.As a cop, I have witnessed countless acts of bravery and selflessness performed by my colleagues. I can count on one hand the times I saw them betray their oaths. We owe it to these officers to provide them with the best training and afford them the ability to train often. Frequency builds muscle memory. And when you are asked to make complex decisions in a matter of seconds, muscle memory could save the officer\u2019s life or allow them to save yours.The reality of gun violence in the US is bleak, but history shows it's not hopelessPolice officers also deserve state-of-the-art protective equipment. The job carries unavoidable risks, but to the extent that we can keep them safe we owe them that much.Too many times toward the end of my career I heard politicians, media pundits and even executives in my own department prioritize optics over officer safety. Police need some of the heavy armament that some people criticize as excessive. Yes, armored cars look scary, but they are just bullet-resistant vehicles that keep cops safe.Finally, we owe it to these officers to reduce the likelihood that they will have to encounter firearms wielded by criminals or those suffering from mental health issues. We need to require background checks for the transfer of all firearms in the United States. Background checks aren\u2019t federally mandated when guns are given as gifts, but they should be. As a gun owner who plans to one day transfer my firearms to my children, I would gladly pay the nominal fee and undergo the slight inconvenience of visiting a local licensed federal firearms dealer to complete that transaction.In fact, every single firearms transfer in this country should begin with a background check. It takes only a few minutes, and the fees are nominal. It\u2019s a small inconvenience that should be borne by all gun buyers if it means helping keep our fellow Americans safe.Signs that we've finally reached a tipping point on gunsWe are all going to have to give a little for the betterment of our country. It\u2019s called compromise. Red flag laws aren\u2019t perfect, but they work. We should embrace them, rather than write them off.Thethat they need an AR-15. You want one because you want one. That\u2019s it. It\u2019s time Americans start placing their public safety needs over their recreational desires. There are many firearm platforms available that serve the same purpose and can be used to accomplish the same goal.As I thought about Officer Wilt, I recalled my own experiences as a rookie cop working in the inner city.By the time I was 25, I had seen the effects of gun violence firsthand. The countless shooting scenes in which men, women and children\u2019s bodies were torn apart by bullets. I buried several colleagues, including my, who died during a training event. Listening to the dispatcher call James\u2019 \u201cEnd of Watch\u201d was one of the most emotional moments of my life.Over the course of my two decades as a police officer, I saw the body of an infant who had been killed by the child\u2019s father, who was high on PCP., and I stared down the barrel of a gun wielded by a young teenager.This is the job, and this is what is asked of these officers.  Every single goddamn day."

Any club that\u2019s been involved [in a tragedy], nobody from those clubs should ever do it again.\u201dWhile most fans are quick to condemn the offensive chanting, the practice shows no sign of going away.In February, Leeds and Manchester United released a joint statement following the club\u2019s Premier League fixture after incidents of tragedy chanting from both sets of fans, which targeted both the Munich air disaster and the death of two Leeds fans in 2000 the day before a UEFA Cup semifinal against Galatasaray in Istanbul.Another case of tragedy chanting by a group of Chelsea fans in a 0-0 draw against Liverpool at Stamford Bridge in early April \u2013 which the London club condemned as \u201chateful\u201d \u2013 caused the Premier League to issue a statement saying it would be addressing the issue \u201cas a priority and as a matter of urgency.\u201dAdditionally, some Manchester City and Nottingham Forest fans have been criticized this season for singing songs about Hillsborough in matches against Liverpool.However, in the return fixture against Liverpool at Anfield, the traveling Forest supporters were praised for unveiling a banner calling for respect for the victims and the end to tragedy chanting.In an attempt to eradicate the issue, the Premier League has set up a working group with top-flight clubs to educate supporters about the tragedies in question and the impact such chanting has on fans.The working group has also been in contact with the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) to discuss whether convictions can be pursued for fans that engage in tragedy chanting.Geoff Pearson, a professor at Manchester University who has specialized in football crowd disorder, says self-policing within a fan base is \u201cabsolutely the key\u201d to eradicating the practice, especially as some of the chants \u201caren\u2019t by their content unlawful.\u201dThis makes asking the police to get involved \u201cquite challenging,\u201d he explains.\u201cThe most powerful thing is when the fan in front of you just turns around and says: \u2018Shut up, we don\u2019t do that at this club,\u2019 because that is a powerful message,\u201d Pearson told CNN Sport.\u201cIt\u2019s humiliating for the fan that\u2019s done that and I think this explains for a large part why we have almost eradicated overt racist chanting in English football stadiums.\u201cYou go away with England [the national team] and you go into certain bars, and you will hear racist chanting, but you don\u2019t hear it in the stadium because that\u2019s where it has become unacceptable.\u201cBut a combination of messaging and, occasionally \u2013 if you have a really entrenched problem \u2013 banning some individuals or taking criminal action if you can against some individuals has also made an impact.\u201dCNN has reached out to the UK government\u2019s Football Policing Unit, but has yet to receive a response.Neil Atkinson, a writer for Liverpool FC website \u201cThe Anfield Wrap,\u201d echoes those sentiments, telling CNN the first thing fans should do if a fellow supporter begins engaging in tragedy chanting is to \u201cdrown it out\u201d with other songs.\u201cIf it isn\u2019t the majority of supporters, it shouldn\u2019t be the majority of the noise and there is an immediate practical step [people can take],\u201d he says.\u201cThe next thing is education through action by the clubs. Leeds United have been looking to do that,\u201d Atkinson adds, referring to the anti-chanting campaign launched by the Yorkshire club last year.\u201cArsenal and Fulham have both visited the [Hillsborough] memorial. I still think a wider societal understanding of what happened in 1989 and the smears that have followed would be no bad thing in general.\u201dLast month, Arsenal and Fulham\u2019s team managers and captains laid wreaths at the Hillsborough memorial to mark the 34th anniversary of the disaster.Our thoughts are with our friends at Liverpool FC and all the families of the victims of the Hillsborough disaster \u2013 April 15, 1989.In the immediate aftermath of the Hillsborough disaster and in the years that followed, the Sun newspaper and local South Yorkshire police launched athat tried to place the blame on Liverpool supporters,Ahead of Manchester United\u2019s visit to Anfield last month, managers Jurgen Klopp and Erik ten Hag released a joint statement urging supporters of both clubs to stop chants in stadiums and online abuse relating to the tragedies.\u201cIt is unacceptable to use the loss of life \u2014 in relation to any tragedy \u2014 to score points, and it is time for it to stop,\u201d United boss ten Hag said.\u201cThose responsible tarnish not only the reputation of our clubs but also, importantly, the reputation of themselves, the fans, and our great cities.\u201dLiverpool\u2019s Klopp added that chants about tragedies \u201chave no place in football.\u201d\u201cIf we can keep the passion and lose the poison it will be so much better for everyone,\u201d he said.While this is by no means a new issue \u2013 Pearson notes some of the earliest Munich chants happened during the 1957/58 season \u2013 it has undoubtedly become more prevalent this season.Charlotte Hennessey, whose father James was one of the 97 fans who died at Hillsborough, created a petition calling for tragedy chanting to be made a criminal offense, which has received more than 17,000 signatures.Speaking to the Mirror earlier this month, she described what it feels like to hear opposition fans singing about the tragedy.\u201cAll I wanted to do was watch the football in my own home with my children,\u201d she said of Liverpool\u2019s match at City. \u201cThen I hear the hate chanting.\u201cThe chanting starts, and I can\u2019t even watch the match,\u201d said Charlotte, 40. \u201cI have to explain to my children why people are so cruel, and how the lies go all the way back to 1989.\u201dFor those affected by the tragedies, hearing those chants \u201churts us all,\u201d Rowland says, \u201ccertainly those of us who were there.\u201cYou only have to imagine how that hurts those who lost relatives and friends.\u201d"

        "text": "Editor\u2019s Note:to get this weekly column as a newsletter. We\u2019re looking back at the strongest, smartestof the week from CNN and other outlets.In 1917, British analysts deciphered a coded message the German foreign minister sent to one of his country\u2019s diplomats vowing to begin \u201cunrestricted submarine warfare\u201d and seeking to win over Mexico with a promise to \u201creconquer the lost territory in Texas, New Mexico and Arizona\u201d if the US entered the world war. When it became public, the Zimmerman Telegram caused a sensation, helping propel the US into the conflict against Germany.\u201cNever before or since has so much turned upon the solution of a secret message,\u201d wrote David Kahn in his classic 1967 history of secret communications, \u201cThe Codebreakers.\u201d The Germans had taken great pains to keep their intentions confidential, and the codebreakers in London\u2019shad to do a lot of work to decipher the telegram.Their efforts stand in stark contrast to the ease with which secrets came tumbling out of a Pentagon intelligence network when 21-year-old Massachusetts Air National Guard cyber specialist Jack Teixeira allegedly posted hundreds of documents on a Discord chatroom known as \u201cThug Shaker Central.\u201d The disclosures likely won\u2019t start a war, but they could prove extremely damaging to the US and several of its allies, including Ukraine.Teixeira is one ofwho have Top Secret clearance. \u201cThe Pentagon has already started taking steps to limit the number of people who have access to such sensitive information,\u201d wrote, a former US diplomat and Obama administration official. \u201cBut much more can be done. \u2026 Why do so many people, especially those working short stints in government,\u201dWriting in the Financial Times,saw \u201csome good news.\u201d\u201cWhile specific details will be incredibly valuable to Russia and other adversaries, these are not bombshell revelations: journalists had already reported Ukrainian ammunition running low; peace talks between Moscow and Kyiv were never likely; allies have long been aware that the US eavesdrops on them; and the disparaging assessment of Ukraine\u2019s forthcoming offensive may prove no more accurate than previous predictions were.\u201d These will not prove as damaging as theanddisclosures.But, she warned, \u201cTechnology making data ever more portable, distribution more global and communications more bespoke\u2014 either privately or publicly.\u201dIn less than a week, the two Democrats expelled from the Tennessee House for their participation in a gun control protest were sent back to office by local officials.Writing for CNN Opinion, Rep.noted, \u201cThis should be a chastening moment for revanchist forces in Tennessee\u2019s legislature and across the country. Over the long haul, the undemocratic machinations employed to oust us from office are destined to fail. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. once famously said that the moral arc of the universe bends toward justice. Events this week demonstrated, more than ever, that this is indeed the case\u2026\u201d\u201cOver two-thirds of Americans \u2014 including four out of 10 Republicans \u2014 support the kind of common sense gun safety laws that Rep. Jones, Rep. Johnson and I were protesting in favor of, in the wake of the senseless March 27 Covenant School massacre.\u201d\u201cAnd yet,where a Republican supermajority is wildly out of step with most people\u2019s values.\u201dThe politics of gun control have shifted, argued Democratic strategist. The NRA\u2019s internal struggles have weakened its influence while Democrats in office, who once feared touching the issue of guns, are increasingly speaking out. And they are making some progress in enacting new state laws, Burns noted.\u201cThe American people decisively support Democratic proposals for addressing the scourge of gun violence. Political watchers who criticized Democrats for talking too much about abortion during the 2022 midterm elections later ate crow after that once-dreaded culture war topic topped the list of voter concerns nationally\u2026\u201cBiden and the Democrats have the rare opportunity to build\u201dOn Friday, the Supreme Court issued an order that temporarily ensured access to a key drug used in many medication abortions. The move gave the justices more time to consider the issue after a Texas federal judge suspended the US Food and Drug Administration\u2019s approval of the abortion pill 23 years ago.\u201cIf abortion opponents are successful, access to the pill \u2014 reportedly used in more than half of abortions in the United States \u2014 will be severely undercut,\u201d wroteand.\u201cBeyond the dangerous precedent this sets for challenges to other important FDA-approved drugs that some political factions don\u2019t like, the case is an alarming expression of the way right-wing activists are\u2026\u201d\u201cThere are no grounds for challenging mifepristone\u2019s approval, especially 23 years after the fact. The drug received extensive review \u2014 more than four years \u2014 before FDA approval. Moreover, claims that mifepristone threatens the health of those who take it are unfounded. The drug has a better safety record for use than Viagra and penicillin. Notably, it was available and used for years without incident in Europe.\u201dIn 1986, Nicholas Daniloff, the Moscow bureau chief for US News & World Report, was seized by Soviet authorities and locked up in Lefortovo prison. He was the last American journalist to be arrested in Russia before last month\u2019s detention of Wall Street Journal correspondent Evan Gershkovich, who like Daniloff, speaks Russian fluently. Gershkovich has been charged with espionage but US officials have concluded that he was \u201cwrongfully detained.\u201dAsnoted, Daniloff\u2019s detention in prison lasted for 13 days before he was put under house arrest and then eventually swapped for an accused Soviet spy. In a conversation with Andelman, Daniloff recalled his reaction when he was imprisoned. \u201cI felt claustrophobic, and I felt like I wanted to get out of there immediately. Of course, there was no chance of that. The door slams, and you have all these thoughts and feelings that run through you, and\u201dGershkovich\u2019s family in Philadelphia received a letter, handwritten in Russian, from the reporter Friday.\u201cI want to say that,\u201d he noted. \u201cI read. I exercise. And I am trying to write. Maybe, finally, I am going to write something good.\u201dThe Amazon series \u201cThe Marvelous Mrs. Maisel\u201d returns this month for its fifth and final season \u2014 andis here for it. The series brings back memories of visiting his grandparents Irma and Mordy in their \u201ctiny rent-controlled Greenwich Village apartment,\u201d an experience that helped shape his Jewish identity.\u201cAs a Jewish historian,\u201d Perry wrote, \u201cI worry about the tension between preserving the memory of past hardships while not locking our entire history into a tale of oppression. The moments of peace and joy are as vital as the moments of violence. In fact, it\u2019s the periods of peace, of success, of interfaith community, that reveal the terrible truth about the violence: it wasn\u2019t inevitable. People could have made different choices\u2026\u201d\u201cA show like \u2018The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel\u2019. It\u2019s a warm, funny, sexy, extremely Jewish \u2026. comedy that hits me straight in my glossy childhood memories. That isn\u2019t to say the show isn\u2019t also problematic \u2014 it most certainly is.\u201dIn the latest installment of CNN Opinion\u2019s \u201cLittle Kids, Big Questions\u201d series, 10-year-old Ronan wonders if animals are capable of being smarter than humans. With the help of the John Templeton Foundation, which is partnering on the project, the answer came from, world renowned for her work with chimpanzees.\u201cOne of the attributes of intelligence is the ability to think and solve problems. In the early 1960s, I was told that this was unique to humans, and only we could use and make tools, only we had language and culture,\u201d Goodall said. \u201cBut more and more research has proved that many animals are excellent at solving problems. Many use tools, and many show cultural differences. Some scientists believe that whales and dolphins are communicating with what may be a real language.\u201d\u201cAlthough the difference between humans and other animals is simply one of degree, our intellect really is amazing. \u2026bees can count and do math, and that just shows how much we still have to learn about animal intelligence..\u201dEarlier this month, a Texas jury convicted Daniel Perry of murder for fatally shooting a Black Lives Matter protester in 2020. The jury deliberated for 17 hours and decided Perry\u2019s action couldn\u2019t be excused under the state\u2019s \u201cstand your ground\u201d law. Prosecutors argued Perry had instigated the incident and they introduced into evidence messages that suggested the shooting was not a spur-of-the-moment act but a premeditated one.On the evening of the jury verdict, Fox News host Tucker Carlson criticized the decision and told viewers he had invited Texas Gov. Greg Abbott on the show to ask if he would consider pardoning Perry. Others on the right called for Abbott to issue a pardon, and the governor soon responded with an announcement that he would do just that, as long as the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles recommended that Perry should be granted one.\u201cTrial verdicts are determined by judges and juries,\u201d wrote. \u201cHis pardon, when it comes, is not what the rule of law looks like.\u201dTwo of the likeliest candidates for president in 2024 haven\u2019t officially committed yet.President Joe Biden says he intends to run again but has delayed making a formal announcement. And Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis is making all the moves a presidential contender usually makes, including hawking his new book and visiting New Hampshire, but he hasn\u2019t joined fellow Republicans including former President Donald Trump, former UN Ambassador Nikki Haley and former Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson in declaring.\u201cDeSantis, who was neck and neck with the former president just a few months ago, may have lost a step or two in more recent polling. But his track record of successful governance in Florida should,\u201d observed.\u201cA third Trump presidential nomination would indicate that Republican primary voters may prefer style over substance. But if they are serious about not just making liberals mad but advancing actual policy, GOP voters should consider other names, starting with the Florida governor.\u201dEven without an official announcement by the president, wrote, the Biden-Harris campaign is very much under way. \u201cBy choosing to lie low while Republicans are gearing up for 2024, Biden is employing his version of what has become known as the \u2018Rose Garden Strategy,\u2019 whereby the incumbent campaigns by focusing on the business of being president and showing voters that he is the responsible figure in the race.\u201d\u201cThe president\u2019s understated strategy makes room for Republicans to stoke chaos, tear each other apart and make unforced errors while he remains above the fray for as long as possible. This strategy makes the GOP the focus of the election, allowing Biden to reinforce his message from 2020:\u201d::::::::recently took a domestic flight in South Africa. \u201cPassengers and airport staff alike were friendly and polite. The airplane seat offered enough room for both of my legs and both of my arms. We took off on time and landed early. My shoes stayed on the whole time I was at the airport.\u201dIt was a vivid reminder of what\u2019s possible in air travel \u2014 and of what\u2019s usually lacking.Take the security system: \u201cMore than 20 years after Sept. 11, 2001, only passengers who pay for the privilege can avoid removing their shoes and laptops from their bags by submitting their personal information ahead of time and undergoing background checks.\u201dFilipovic added, \u201cAdmittedly, I do pay \u2014 I don\u2019t want to wait in a long security line, walk my stocking feet through a metal detector and have to un- and re-pack the MacBook I\u2019ve carefully crammed into my carry-on.to pre-screen a critical mass of passengers to avoid the morass of cranky people trying to pull on their shoes while re-packing their electronics.\u201d"

        "link": "https://edition.cnn.com/travel/article/chance-encounters-camino-de-santiago/index.html",
        "text": "When Loni Philbrick-Linzmeyer decided to walk the Camino de Santiago, she was adamant this was something she had to do alone.It was 2013. Loni was a 29-year-old Californian school teacher who was \u201cat a crossroads.\u201d She\u2019d just endured a tough break-up and was feeling adrift.\u201cIt really spun me into questioning my own values and my own future \u2013 whether I wanted kids, what was my path for that?\u201d Loni tellstoday. \u201cWorkwise, I was also in kind of a rough spot, I had a really tough year of teaching.\u201dAs she tried to escape these feelings by socializing and keeping busy, at the back of her mind, Loni knew what she really needed was time to pause and reflect. She was a \u201cbit fearful\u201d of what would happen if she just left things rolling on, unchanging. Would she end up stuck? Even more unhappy?One night, tossing and turning and unable to sleep, Loni decided, definitively, that she was going to take action. Some late night Googling led her to discover the Camino de Santiago, the famous pilgrimage trail that spans some 500 miles (800 kilometers) across France, Portugal and Spain. The historical pilgrimage\u2019s multiple routes conclude in the Spanish city of Santiago de Compostela, at its spectacular cathedral.Loni booked a plane ticket to Paris there and then.\u201cIt was very spontaneous, very random, but also at a moment in time where I just knew I had to do something else to really shake up the habits that I had \u2013 and give a lot of reflection time to my life and where I wanted to go and who I wanted to be,\u201d says Loni. \u201cSo that\u2019s how I came to the Camino.\u201dOver the next two months, Loni trained and prepared for the adventure. Her loved ones were supportive, albeit a little concerned about Loni embarking on the trip alone. But Loni was adamant this needed to be an independent adventure, so her parents bought a large map of the Camino route and hung it in their house to map Loni\u2019s progress with sticky dots as she updated them on her movements.Across the Atlantic in Denmark, 24-year-old Kjartan Bergqvist was halfway through medical school and questioning his decision to become a doctor. Was it the right path?An ex-girlfriend had once mentioned the Camino de Santiago \u2013 before then, Kjartan had never heard of it \u2013 but during late night study sessions when he should have been poring over medical textbooks, Kjartan found himself thinking about the Camino. In the end, his decision to embark on the trek was even more spontaneous than Loni\u2019s.\u201cI went into Copenhagen, bought some hiking boots and a bag and basically left the next day on the train to Paris,\u201d says Kjartan.Like Loni, Kjartan felt strongly that this needed to be a solo trip \u2013 so much so, that he didn\u2019t even mention the Camino to any friends or family. He told his parents he was planning to travel around Europe, but kept specifics vague.Loni and Kjartan set off from Paris within days of each other, each soon finding solace in life on Camino.There was something comforting \u2013 and exciting \u2013 about waking up each day and walking solidly. There was endless time for reflecting and thinking things through alone. There was also plenty of opportunity for connection with fellow hikers.\u201cIt\u2019s very open on the Camino,\u201d says Loni. \u201cIt can be as independent or as social as you want or need on the day.\u201dSometimes Loni would walk with other travelers for a little while. Other times she\u2019d stay solo for long stretches, but enjoy greeting friendly faces along the route. Fellow walkers were instantly recognizable, with their backpacks and hiking boots.\u201cSometimes you have extended conversations with people, regarding all different kinds of topics, sometimes it\u2019s really deep emotional stuff. Other times, it\u2019s more superficial,\u201d says Kjartan.Whenever Kjartan or Loni would cross paths with fellow pilgrims \u2013 as Camino walkers are often called \u2013 they\u2019d offer the same warm greeting: \u201cBuen Camino.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s such a good phrase, because it means hello and farewell at the same time,\u201d says Kjartan.It was around two weeks into their respective trips that Kjartan and Loni first met. They were in a forested area, not far from the Spanish city of Burgos.\u201cBuen Camino,\u201d they said to one another as their eyes met. Then Loni commented on the weather \u2013 there were some clouds in the distance, and she was excited by the prospect of rain. She lived in California, she explained, where it never rained.\u201cI\u2019m Kjartan,\u201d said Kjartan. \u201cI\u2019m from Copenhagen, Denmark.\u201d It rained a lot there, Kjartan said, so as far as he was concerned, a rainy day in Spain wasn\u2019t too appealing.The interaction was friendly, but brief \u2013 and neither of them suggested they walk on together, so Kjartan continued on ahead.As he walked off, a surprising thought crossed Loni\u2019s mind: \u201cI can move to Copenhagen for that guy.\u201d\u201cIt was weird, it wasn\u2019t love at first sight,\u201d says Loni today. \u201cI think I ended up forgetting his name later \u2013 but certainly there was a moment of, \u2018Okay, maybe I\u2019m kind of interested here.\u2019\u201dAs Kjartan strode on ahead, he found himself hoping he\u2019d cross paths with Loni again.And sure enough, that evening the two strangers ended up in the same Burgos inn, which was filled with other Camino walkers.\u201cTypically in the evening, people kind of gather, maybe have some wine and some chat and then hit the bed early, to be ready the next day to continue walking,\u201d says Kjartan.When Kjartan spotted Loni walk in, he was thrilled.\u201cI ran straight over,\u201d he says.\u201cThat\u2019s when I forgot his name,\u201d says Loni, laughing. \u201cBut it is a bit hard for Americans to say Kjartan.\u201dThe two talked a little bit that night, but most of the conversation was in a group setting, as fellow Camino walkers shared stories with one another and compared blisters.At one point Loni mentioned that she was planning to take the following day as a rest day and explore Burgos. Kjartan hadn\u2019t been intending to linger, but he figured maybe he\u2019d do the same, in the hope another opportunity to spend time with Loni might arise.\u201cI just went to bed that night really wanting to talk to you the next morning,\u201d Kjartan tells Loni today.He was so excited by the prospect that he barely slept. The next morning, he \u201cjumped out of bed and ran downstairs.\u201dThere was Loni, preparing to head out and explore the city.\u201cDo you want to get a cup of coffee?\u201d Kjartan asked her.\u201cSure, sounds great,\u201d said Loni.She was pleased, but also a little surprised.\u201cHonestly, I mean, it was a bit unexpected \u2013 there were not any other situations on the Camino where someone asked to get a cup of coffee with me,\u201d says Loni today.As a result, the invite took on a formality that it wouldn\u2019t have done back home. It kind of felt like a date. But it was just coffee. Maybe Kjartan was just being friendly? Or he just really liked coffee?\u201cWhen we sat down and started talking, I had to maybe tease apart what your intentions were \u2013 if it was because you were interested in me or you just wanted a cup of coffee,\u201d Loni says to Kjartan today.\u201cBut actually, once we started talking, very quickly the conversation flowed really easily.\u201dLoni and Kjartan were just settling into a flow when they were interrupted by a Canadian Camino walker, Liz, who recognized them from the evening before \u2013 and didn\u2019t quite pick up on the romantic vibes.\u201cShe had a sore knee and couldn\u2019t walk that day,\u201d explains Kjartan. \u201cSo she actually joined us, and we ended up a little group of three \u2013 and we just hung out in the city, because it\u2019s a beautiful place.\u201dThe group spent the day soaking up Burgos, strolling the streets, popping into a museum. In the evening, they went out for sangria and Liz retired early, leaving Kjartan and Loni to pick up where they\u2019d left off in the morning.By then, there was no question there was something between them. It was an amazing evening, but the next day Loni woke up feeling conflicted.\u201cI had this super strong reaction where I just thought, \u2018I didn\u2019t come here to have a fling. I didn\u2019t come all this way to meet some guy and hang out for two weeks,\u2019\u201d she says.Loni voiced her concerns to Kjartan, who understood where she was coming from.\u201cI had been very conscious about not wanting to join a group up until that point,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I also remember a shift, meeting Loni.\u201dThe two decided to spend the next day apart, but reunite in the evening and talk about how to proceed.In the meantime, Loni confided in her new friend Liz, talking through her concerns. She surprised herself with her conclusion.\u201cI actually realized that the most vulnerable thing that I could do \u2013 and probably this was the growth that I was most searching for \u2013 would be to open myself up to actually walking with someone else,\u201d she says.\u201cSo what I thought I had gone to do as a very independent thing ended up needing actually to be more open, more vulnerable, more exposing.\u201dWhen Loni and Kjartan regrouped, he jumped in first \u2013 saying he thought they should walk the rest of the Camino independently \u2013 he wanted to respect Loni\u2019s feelings and original intentions. But Loni interrupted. She\u2019d had a change of heart, she explained.\u201cYou know what? I actually want to walk with you,\u201d she said.They met while hiking and fell in love. Two months later she was diagnosed with cancerAnd so Loni and Kjartan set off from Burgos together, with Liz rounding out the group.Both Loni and Kjartan were glad Liz was there too \u2013 she was funny and good-natured, great at keeping things fun and light. And she quickly became a great friend to both Loni and Kjartan.Every day, the two would wake up and check in with each other \u2013 did they still want to walk together?\u201cMost days for the rest of the Camino, the answer was yes. And we walked together. And there were some days where we said, \u2018No, I need some time apart today.\u2019 And we just agreed where we would meet up,\u201d says Loni.The days rolled on, and Loni and Kjartan grew closer. They\u2019d hike through stretches of Spanish countryside, sharing stories about their lives and how they felt about everything \u2013 from their hopes for the future to their views on marriage.Loni had also reached a conclusion to one of the questions that had been bothering her before the trip \u2013 she now knew she wanted children. And Kjartan told her early on that having a family was important to him too.Prior to Loni and Kjartan meeting, they\u2019d both been focused on the ultimate goal of reaching Santiago. But somehow that goal didn\u2019t seem as important anymore. They were more open to unexpected detours \u2013 like the time they spent a whole day and evening at a quirky, hammock-filled B&B, where chickens ran around at their feet and a donkey brayed in the background.\u201cSantiago didn\u2019t really matter anymore,\u201d says Kjartan.\u201cSomething had switched,\u201d agrees Loni. \u201cThe realization that actually it\u2019s the journey and it\u2019s those moments along the way that you don\u2019t anticipate that actually made it really memorable.\u201dTime on the Camino also seemed to operate at a different frequency to time in the \u201creal world.\u201d\u201cThose three weeks felt a lot longer, in a good way, a very good way,\u201d says Kjartan. \u201cI was just flying so high \u2013 obviously very much in love, and it\u2019s summer, and there\u2019s no place you have to be other than where you are at the moment.\u201dBut as they approached Santiago, Loni and Kjartan were overtaken with excitement, an urge to see the finish line.Liz wanted to walk a little slower, so on their final day, Loni and Kjartan hiked as a twosome, trekking some 31 miles (50 kilometers) and arriving into Santiago in the middle of the night.It was surreal, seeing the Cathedral at last, illuminated only by moonlight. All the hotels were closed, so the two slept on the street, sharing a single sleeping bag.\u201cI realized that I did not want this to end, I didn\u2019t want to go home without having Loni in my life,\u201d says Kjartan.Loni felt the same way. And swapping contact details and promising to stay in touch didn\u2019t seem enough. Even committing to a long distance romance felt lacking.\u201cI don\u2019t want to go home without you,\u201d Kjartan told Loni, the day after they\u2019d arrived in Santiago.\u201cMe neither,\u201d said Loni.\u201cIt\u2019s settled then,\u201d said Kjartan.\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d asked Loni.\u201cDo you really need me to ask you?\u201d asked Kjartan.\u201cYes, I do,\u201d said Loni.So Kjartan said the words aloud: \u201cWill you marry me?\u201dLoni was overjoyed.\u201cIn my secret desires, I\u2019d wanted it,\u201d she says of the proposal. \u201cI think I was excited and, you know, a little nervous, but also, I don\u2019t remember having any doubt that it was the right choice and that we would be able to do it. It was just clear as day \u2013 this is the path.\u201dI did not want this to end, I didn\u2019t want to go home without having Loni in my lifeKjartan BergqvistThe day before, Loni had FaceTimed her mom and introduced her to Kjartan for the first time. Now, she texted her excitedly, \u201cI\u2019m engaged!\u201dShe decided to wait and tell her friends once she was back in the US. As for Kjartan, he sent his parents a postcard filling them in, \u201csaying I was engaged and very excited, but they had to wait for the story until I came home.\u201dLoni found herself returning to the thought she\u2019d had when she first saw Kjartan \u2013 she would move to Copenhagen for him. It wasn\u2019t just a romantic notion, there was a practical element to this decision: Kjartan was still in medical school, but as a teacher it would be easier for Loni to work anywhere.Then it was time for Loni and Kjartan to, temporarily, go their separate ways. Saying farewell wasn\u2019t easy. But they departed excited and confident in their shared future.\u201cI really believe that we decided not to spend the energy deciding whether we should be together, but pour that energy into figuring out how to be together in the best way possible,\u201d says Loni.\u201cMaking that active decision on both ends helped us survive the whole going home, back into our own lives,\u201d says Kjartan. \u201cWe were very determined and made an active decision to be together, and that was the most important thing.\u201dThey were strangers in Bolivia. Six months later they fell in love in ParisSaying goodbye to one another was sad, but saying farewell to life on the Camino was almost harder. Loni and Kjartan had loved the simplicity of waking up each day, walking with a goal. They\u2019d loved the community too. It was hard to leave it behind.Loni says she returned to California determined to \u201chold onto the Camino and the spirit of the Camino.\u201d\u201cWhen I left the Camino, I felt so at peace, just a sense of peace in myself,\u201d she says.In early 2014, six months after they first met, Loni and Kjartan got married in a courthouse in San Diego, California. They kept their nuptials small, planning a larger celebration for that summer. But Liz flew in from her home in Canada to surprise them, and it seemed only right she acted as one of their witnesses. Loni took Kjartan\u2019s name, becoming Loni Bergqvist.The subsequent summer wedding was a weekend of celebrations, and was also the first time many of Loni and Kjartan\u2019s friends and family met. By the end of the weekend, they were a tight, multinational family.Liz officiated the proceedings, sharing the story of how she\u2019d unintentionally interrupted Loni and Kjartan\u2019s first date, and then had a front row seat as their relationship unfurled on the Camino. Loni and Kjartan wrote their own vows, and read them to one another.It was still a little while until the couple lived in the same country \u2013 before she got a job in Denmark, Loni got a job in London. But eventually, in 2015, Loni moved to Copenhagen, and in with Kjartan. The couple gave birth to their first child not long after.An American tourist fell in love with a European flight attendant in 1969. They've been married for over 50 yearsToday, Loni and Kjartan are still in Denmark, where they\u2019re enjoying bringing up their three bilingual children. Kjartan recently quit medicine and is now studying theology, while Loni has her own education consultancy business.For both Loni and Kjartan, building their own family has brought them joy and fulfillment. Loni says it\u2019s amazing to see their kids, \u201cbecome these awesome little people with their own strong personalities and way of meeting the world.\u201dThe couple still strive to keep \u201cthe spirit of the Camino\u201d alive in their day to day lives. But as time goes on, Loni and Kjartan find themselves reflecting less on the origins of their love story, and more on what happened next, and where they are today.\u201cI feel like it\u2019s not hard to go to Spain and fall in love \u2013 but it\u2019s really taking the decision to commit and do the work that it takes, that\u2019s what I\u2019m really proud of,\u201d says Kjartan.\u201cThere\u2019s a reality to falling in love and taking a decision to get married,\u201d agrees Loni. \u201cThere\u2019s also a reality of moving to a foreign place, without your family or friends or knowing anybody except for one person.\u201dKjartan and I both went thinking that we desired a certain thing and that we needed a certain thing. And I think what happened was that the Camino provided something else unexpectedLoni BergqvistLoni loves living in Denmark, but she\u2019s also had to acclimatize to cultural differences and adapt to living far away from loved ones. Kjartan says he\u2019s always conscious of that, calling their relationship, \u201cinherently asymmetric in certain aspects.\u201d\u201cLoni has left everything behind to be with me in Denmark. I have not sacrificed the same for Loni. I\u2019m in my own country surrounded by my family and friends,\u201d he says.Loni became acutely aware of the reality of living far from her home country when her parents unexpectedly passed away, her mother in 2016 from complications with lung cancer and her dad from a heart attack in 2021.\u201cMy parents loved to come visit in Denmark. My dad was learning Danish and would visit every three months after my mom died,\u201d says Loni.Loni says she\u2019s grateful for Kjartan\u2019s continuing support as she comes to terms with the loss of her parents.\u201cBeing able to support a partner who is grieving has given us a deeper bond,\u201d she says. \u201cWhat you need in grief is a bit unexplainable, but Kjartan has been able to be there and pick up the pieces during two fairly traumatic deaths. I honestly don\u2019t know what I would have done without him.\u201dLoni and Kjartan are as confident in their future today as they were that day in Santiago, when they got engaged after knowing each for just 23 days.\u201cThere\u2019s a saying on the Camino, and it\u2019s \u2018the Camino provides,\u2019\u201d says Loni. \u201cThat can be anything from \u2013 you have a twisted ankle and there\u2019s help that comes, or there\u2019s a situation in which you can\u2019t see clearly and someone talks you through that and helps you see clarity.\u201dLoni and Kjartan believe the Camino provided them with one another.\u201cKjartan and I both went thinking that we desired a certain thing and that we needed a certain thing. And I think what happened was that the Camino provided something else unexpected,\u201d says Loni. It wasn\u2019t what they expected, but it was absolutely what they needed.Kjartan thinks it was \u201cdivine timing.\u201dLoni\u2019s less sure about fate or destiny. But whatever it was, it \u201cwas certainly something very special.\u201dCorrection: An earlier headline on this story misstated the time frame in which the couple became engaged."

        "link": "https://edition.cnn.com/travel/article/imphal-india-mothers-market-intl-hnk/index.html",
        "text": "Editor\u2019s Note:Sign up for. Get the latest news in aviation, food and drink, where to stay and other travel developments.At first glance, Ima Keithel is much like any other market. Lines of vendors are here from dusk until dawn, eagerly flogging everything from fresh fruit to fish and fabrics.But after walking through its huge network of more than 5,000 stalls spread across three multi-story buildings and a sea of surrounding tin shacks, one unique aspect becomes hard to ignore: every single trader, without exception, is a woman.\u201cWe are just like family, we\u2019re sisters,\u201d says Meilani Chingangbam, a 65-year-old who has been selling religious ritual products like incense and shrine decorations at the market since 2002. \u201cIt\u2019s a beautiful place to work. Everyone is trusting and kind.\u201dIma Keithel \u2013 meaning \u201cmother\u2019s market\u201d in the local Meitei language \u2013 in Imphal, the capital of India\u2019s northeastern state of Manipur, is said to be the largest women-only market in the world. Men can enter the space \u2013 but only to buy goods, to work as porters or guards or to provide the women with cups of milky chai.During the early morning rush, the scent of eromba, a local dish of mashed potato, bamboo shoots and dried fish chutney, sizzles through the air. In one corner, a group of matriarchs are huddled around discussing problems with delayed deliveries and subpar produce.All the while, women stop by to leave offerings at the shrine of Ima Imoinu, the goddess of wealth and business and the market\u2019s main protector.The crowded aisles are stacked high with all manner of delightful treasures: fragrant pinewood and jade-colored betel nut leaves, handcrafted pottery and bamboo baskets, fine silken blankets and rugs in technicolor hues.Filling the spaces in between them are rows of traders wearing vibrant pink, yellow, red and green shawls, some with Manipuri chandon marks on their foreheads, others wrapped in Muslim head scarves.\u201cYou can get absolutely anything you could dream of here,\u201d says Lina Moirangthem, a local Meitei tour guide. \u201cThe market is cheap and right in the heart of the city. The entire state\u2019s economy practically runs thanks to these women.\u201dPer custom, only women who are married can officially trade in the market, and to gain a space in the official area, a woman must be nominated by a retiring vendor, who will usually choose a successor she is related to like a sister, daughter or cousin.Devil's dung or dinner delight? The story behind hing, one of India's most divisive ingredientsPriya Kharaibam, for example, is the third generation of her family\u2019s pottery traders at Ima Keithel, following on from her grandmother. \u201cI am proud to run the family business,\u201d says the 34-year-old, flanked by a wall of terracotta pots.The creation of Ima Keithel dates back to the 16th century Kangleipak Kingdom, when it began as a makeshift, open-air market for bartering crops. To bolster the war efforts against the neighboring Burmese and Chinese, in 1533 conscription was made mandatory in Manipur and all men were trained as warriors from a young age to protect the kingdom\u2019s perimeters, which run along the border with Myanmar.It was left, then, for the women to run the city.\u201cThe market was run by women of the state in open air,\u201d says Lokendra Arambam, a former scholar of the region\u2019s precolonial period at Manipur University. \u201cIt began as an all-female activity of selling fish, vegetables and other economic products.\u201dThanks to Imphal\u2019s easily-accessible, strategic position at the center of Manipur, the city gradually grew to become the economic hub of the region, and the women of Ima Keithel became more and more influential.But beyond the day-to-day business trading and exchange, the hardy matriarchs of Ima Keithel have also played a crucial role in social and political activism in Manipur throughout the 500-year-old history of the market right up to this day.In 1891, for example, the women\u2019s protests forced a backtrack on reforms introduced by the British colonizers that favored external trade over them. In 1939, angered at the British policy of exporting local rice to other parts of India, they confronted the army in what was the Anishuba Nupilan, or Second Women\u2019s War \u2013 and won.More recently, when the state government announced plans to build a shopping mall on the market\u2019s site in 2003, they organized weeks-long mass strikes, bringing the economy to a standstill and forcing a reversal. Even now, the women hold regular protests to exert influence, and their input has a serious sway on local elections.\u201cThere\u2019s a huge strength of women working here,\u201d says Thoudam Ongbi Shanti, president of one of the market\u2019s vendors\u2019 groups. \u201cBut we are not extraordinary people, we just want to make ends meet. We want to be responsible mothers.\u201dThese days Ima Keithel is a microcosm of Manipur\u2019s egalitarian society. The state has one of the highest female literacy rates in India and it is seen as a pioneer for gender equality across the country. And while the vast majority of Manipur\u2019s population is the local Meitei ethnic group, true to its progressive values the market also houses Hindi women as well as those representing the state\u2019s 33 indigenous groups.Tungdar Makunga, a 50-year-old vendor from the Maring tribe who occupies a spot in a part of the less formal tin-roofed outer area, is among them.\u201cEven though I only started here recently and I\u2019m not officially registered, the other women are very cooperative and friendly,\u201d she says. \u201cThey make space for me if I need it.\u201dIt's one of India's tastiest snacks. But there's only one place you can sample the real thingOthers have used the freedom of the market to break out of traditional social norms.The 80-year-old fabric seller Nongmai Them Khumsonbi says that when she was a newlywed her husband, at the time a low-paid government clerk, opposed her wish to become a trader at the market because he did not believe a woman should work.\u201cHe didn\u2019t want me to go out,\u201d she grins. \u201cBut I won the argument. And I eventually started earning more than him.\u201dNot everything has been a smooth transaction for these women, however. In January 2016, a magnitude-6.7 earthquake sustained serious damage to the market buildings, and it took almost two years to rebuild. Closures that lasted more than a year during the pandemic also took a toll on the livelihoods of the traders.Revisiting India's forgotten battle of WWII: Kohima-Imphal, the Stalingrad of the EastBut now business is back in full flow at this pioneering yet centuries-old market of mothers in remote northeastern India, every day a mesmeric mix of vibrant colors, sounds and smells \u2013 and the positive effects for the women are priceless.\u201cI love my work from the heart, I do it passionately,\u201d says Oinam Ongbi Jayela, a 64-year-old tailor and widow. \u201cBut it\u2019s not just work. I\u2019m relaxed here. It makes me happy to be with these women. Being here, I feel that I will live for a long time.\u201d"

        "text": "Written byDelving into the archives of pop culture history,\"Remember When?\"is a CNN Style series offering a nostalgic look at the celebrity outfits that defined their eras.It was a performance that pushed the boundaries of live television, not least because of the writhing, semi-naked dancers and Romanesque colonnades aflame. But all the pyrotechnics and simulated sex were eclipsed by a sight more shocking still \u2014 Prince's butt, bared for all to see amid a tangle of lemon yellow lace.Remember when Christian Bale wore a sweep of silver eyeshadow to the 'Velvet Goldmine' premier?The full moon moment occurred at the 1991 MTV Video Music Awards, during a performance of the track \"Get Off. \" Like a pair of frosted windows, Prince's pert derri\u00e8re was framed in a pair of high-waisted cutout pants, which the singer paired with a matching tailored bolero jacket and pumps. It was a shock for everyone watching \u2014 at home and in the studio. \"The camera seemed embarrassed,\" reported the Chicago Tribune of the performance, \"constantly cutting away to avoid whichever lurid scene it was stumbling across.\"The exposing suit featured two hand-dyed panels of lace which created the illusion of a naked butt.That shock factor has waned over time. During the 2010s, in particular, cheeky moments popped up in many a pop star's performances. High-cut, butt-baring thong bodysuits were a mainstay in Miley Cyrus' wardrobe during her 2014 \"Bangerz\" tour. In 2019, Lizzo's VMA set featured a giant inflatable peachy posterior while her backup dancers bent over in an array of assless chaps.But according to Stacia Lang \u2014 Prince's costume designer between 1990 and 1993 \u2014 the controversial pants actually offered less exposure than they appeared. In the latest episode of \"The Prince Mixtape,\" a CNN podcast dedicated to the American music icon and his legacy, Lang explained that she used a thin, net-like fabric called marquisette to suggest exposed buttocks. \"There was a beautiful, white, pure, really heavy French lace that we took right away to the dyers and had that dyed bright citron yellow,\" she said.  \"And also (the dyer) had to dye up several fabrics that would create the illusion that his rear end was showing.\"It was also one of two design ideas Lang put forward to Prince, who she recalls opting for the more conservative option. \"It was just funny because he crossed out with a graphite pencil the one with more exposure. And I thought, 'Well, this is a guy with some modesty.'\"But the result, according to Lang, was still electric. \"There was a lot of buzz backstage,\" she remembers. \"George Michael was talking. I think so was Cindy Crawford. It was crazy because people just couldn't believe that that happened.\"Remember when Gillian Anderson wore this exposed thong on Oscars night?Widely revered and consistently revisited, Prince's sartorial reputation is today perhaps as fondly remembered as his music. But such a legacy isn't created overnight. \"His style was iconic,\" said Marie France, the star's costume designer in the 1980s, on the podcast. \"But (at) the same time, I think, very elegant, not just bizarre.\"According to Lang, the magic formula was his playfulness, immovable sense of self and admiration for the garment-making process. \"His persona, his clothing meant so much to him,\" she said. \"That's one of the reasons why I enjoyed being with him and working with him so much... And he respected what we did.\""

When Berlusconi\u2019s government fell that year, the plans to build the bridge collapsed with his government after the next prime minister, Romano Prodi, deemed it a waste of money and a risk to the environment.Since then, various governments have tried to revive it, and the current ruling coalition under Meloni, Salvini and Berlusconi put it on their list of campaign promises. When Salvini became transport minister, he made it his priority, betting his legacy on the bridge.WeBuild, which still has the bid award on paper, sued the government for breach of contract after the project was paused, but it remains the most likely company to be given the job back despite \u201cexpressions of interest from all over the world, including China,\u201d Salvini told the Foreign Press Association in Rome in March when he presented the plan.\u201cThe ones who won the 2006 tender are the ones who will most likely continue with the final version of the project,\u201d he said, without naming WeBuild directly.WeBuild\u2019s engineering director, Michele Longo, was invited to parliament to talk about the revived plan April 18.24 of the world's most amazing bridges\u201cThe bridge over the Strait of Messina is a project that can break ground immediately. As soon as the contract is reinstated and updated, the project can start,\u201d Longo told parliament. \u201cThe executive design is expected to take eight months, while the time needed to build the bridge will be a little more than six years.\u201dThe cost of the project is 4.5 billion euros ($4.96 billion) for the bridge alone and 6.75 billion euros ($7.4 billion) for the infrastructure to support it on both sides, which includes upgrading road and rail links, building terminals and doing the prep work on the land and seabed to \u201creduce hydrogeological risks\u201d during construction, according to the plan presented to the transportation ministry.Since 1965, 1.2 billion euros ($1.3 billion) in public funds has already been spent on feasibility studies, according to Italian treasury department. Salvini is fond of saying it will cost more \u201cnot to build the bridge than build it.\u201dThe plans may seem well advanced but the challenges are complex.Southern Italy is prone to corruption with two major organized crime syndicates \u2013 the Calabrian \u2018Ndrangheta and the Sicilian Cosa Nostra \u2013 excelling in infiltrating construction projects.Matteo Messina Denaro after 30 years on the lam in Sicily represented a victory.Denaro was against the building of the bridge, as are some other mob bosses, according to testimony from informants who contributed to Denaro\u2019s arrest, in part because the organized crime syndicates feed off poverty and underdevelopment.Despite this, fears remain. An anti-Mafia from study from the Nomos Centre think tank published 20 years ago and now being updated warned parts of the project, such as transport and supply could fall under criminal control, as well as there being the possibility local mobs could demand protection money.Salvini has played down concerns. \u201cI\u2019m not afraid of criminal infiltration,\u201d he told parliament recently, \u201cwe will be able to guarantee that the best Italian, European and global companies work there. There will be supervisory bodies that we are working on for every euro invested on the bridge.\u201dThere are also geophysical problems that may be even more difficult to contend with.The Strait of Messina is along a fault line where a 7.1 earthquake in 1908, killed more than 100,000 people and spawned tsunamis that devastated the coastal areas on both the Calabrian and Sicilian sides of the water. It remains the deadliest recorded seismic event in Europe to date.The waters, too, are turbulent. Currents are so strong they often rip seaweed off the seabed, and they change every six hours, according to NASA, which notes that the strong wave patterns are visible from space.Under WeBuild\u2019s original plan, which is the only one currently under consideration since bids have not been, and may not be, opened, the bridge deck would be built to withstand winds of up to 300 kilometers an hour \u2013 and could stay open to traffic with winds up to 150 kilometers an hour.There would be three vehicle lanes in each direction \u2013 two for traffic, and one for emergency, with train lines in the middle. Under the current plan, 6,000 cars and trucks could pass each hour, and 200 trains could pass each day.The gigantic tunnels and bridges linking Asia to EuropeThe bridge would be around 74 meters above sea level and allow a navigation channel of 600 meters, allowing cargo vessels and even the tallest cruise ships to pass. It would also be designed to withstand a 7.5 magnitude earthquake.The construction phase alone would contribute 2.9 billion euros to the national GDP and employ 100,000 people and 300 suppliers, Longo told parliament, adding \u201cmost of these people would come from the regions of Sicily and Calabria where there the rates of unemployment are high.\u201dOn the geographical challenges, Longo told CNN it is \u201cone of the most dynamic straits of water anywhere between the depths and currents, but it is also one of the most studied areas. There millions of pages of studies dedicated to this area. We\u2019ve read them all.\u201d On the dangers of organized crime getting involved he said \u201cnothing is impossible, but this is low risk.\u201dEnvironmentalists have long argued the bridge would be devastating to the terrain and wildlife.\u201cIn the Strait of Messina, a very important place of transit for birds and marine mammals, one of the highest concentrations of biodiversity in the world is concentrated,\u201d a spokesperson for the group Legambiente says, adding that the bridge \u2013 both during and after construction \u2013 would disrupt migration routes between the Africa and Europe.The World Wildlife Fund has also campaigned against reviving the project. \u201cThe entire Strait of Messina area is a protected area under the EU Habitats Directive,\u201d WWF Institutional Relations director Stefano Lenzi said in a statement. Back in 2006, before the plan was shelved, the group was preparing a lawsuit to try to stop it for breaching European Union protected areas.The environmental groups contend that the half-hour ferry is the least disruptive route.The post-bridge impact to the economy would be unarguably high, Salvini insists, saying that cargo ships from Asia could dock in Sicily and those goods could be transported on high-speed trains to Europe, once high-speed rails are built on Sicily \u2013 although they do not currently exist.Public opinion on both sides of the straits remains mixed, with those in a position to prosper through increased trade and easier tourism generally in support of it and those who don\u2019t mind keeping Sicily isolated largely against it.The bridge has never been as close to being built as it is now, after Meloni signed the decree to pave the way for concrete plans to be put in place. The decree will become law in June, and Salvini said he hopes to break ground by July 2024.The Straits of Messina have long been equated with troubled waters. Homer created the sea monsters\u2019 den for Scylla and Charybdis there for a reason. And while the only monsters might be ecological and criminal, there is little question that no matter when it happens, the dream for some of building the bridge to Messina won\u2019t be put to rest until it\u2019s finished."

        "text": "Written byContributorsA group of girls giggle as they try on a pair of pink glasses, plush pig hats and bunny ears. At another counter of the studio, one carefully straightens her hair. Together, they cram into a photo booth, pose, and then marvel at the photo strips the machine drops below. They tape one onto a wall filled with images of other young patrons.It's a familiar scene playing out at several hundred small photo studios that have recently opened in Seoul. The spaces \u2014 with no staff visibly present \u2014 typically house three to six booths and are open 24 hours a day.Since the pandemic, the studios have become one of the trendiest destinations among South Korean Gen Z. On the main thoroughfare of Hongdae, the city's busiest district, they're found on every block \u2014 sometimes, only a few feet apart.A photo studio in Seoul's Itaewon neighborhood.20-year-old university student Choi Hui-je told CNN he visits a studio every time he goes out with friends, which is around five to seven times a month. Once, he recalled in a phone interview, he went five times in one week.\"It's a necessary stop. We go for food, karaoke, caf\u00e9, and then the photo studio,\" Choi said.19-year-old Jenny Dall'alba, a student in the southern city of Busan, estimates she's gone more than 70 times over the past few years.\"This is not a fad but a must-go-to every time,\" she said.Louis Vuitton stages its first major show in South KoreaMany around the world may have their own memories of hopping into similar booths. In the early 2000s, they surged in popularity thanks to the development of digital technology and coveted sticker versions.But two decades later, in the age of social media and post-pandemic, they've taken on a whole new life in South Korea.Studios differentiate from one another by themes, which is reflected by storefronts, interiors, as well as the appearance of the printed strips themselves.With over 245 locations in the Seoul Metropolitan area and 200 more around the country, Life4Cuts has a major share of the market: the brand estimates 2 million people visit their studios every month.On Instagram there are more than 1.1 million posts with the hashtag Life4Cuts (in Korean) \u2014 with everyone from K-pop stars to influencers posting the outcome of their shoots.Some are seen copying poses from viral TikTok videos or mimicking anime characters' famous moves. Choi himself likes to channel the expressive memes of pink beaver character Zanmang Loopy from the 2003 South Korean animation Pororo the Little Penguin.A group packs into one of the booths \u2014 many are a little more spacious than the ones popular in the early 2000s \u2014 to take pictures.Dall'alba, who keeps all her photos together in a pouch, says she enjoys getting creative by choosing different props and frames. She adds that her friends like to pose with K-pop group members that are baked into each frame and go multiple times to make sure to get a photo with every star.There are also Instagram accounts dedicated to teaching visitors poses to try the next time in a studio.Booths nowadays have better lighting and features like timelapses which have contributed to their popularity.K-pop stars and cartoon characters are regular features on frames. Often, booths provide QR codes so visitors can also download a digital version of their pics.Business owners see the studios as a safe investment opportunity.Kim Joo-hyun opened his Busan-based Life4Cuts studio in 2020, when his restaurant began struggling during the pandemic. With no government permit required to operate, he was able to set up a shop in less than a month, with a relatively moderate investment of 180 million won ($134,000).\"There is a widespread notion that you won't lose money opening them,\" Kim said over the phone, adding that it doesn't take much physical work and he's seen a profit margin of 50%. And while Kim is concerned with growing competition, he is also actively searching for another location to open a studio.Each shop offers customers walls of props like exaggerated plush hats and even hair straighteners.Kim was initially skeptical of whether the studios would be a passing fad, but as people started bringing their family, older relatives, and even dogs into the booth he's since changed his mind.\"(Customers) can buy small but guaranteed happiness,\" he said, for little money at about 4,000 won or $3 a pop. \"The day-to-day life may be difficult but they can enter and exit with a smile on their face.\"How K-pop group NewJeans became an overnight fashion favoriteThe tangible aspect of the photos may be what's particularly appealing to Gen Z. But Choi says there's something deeper \u2014 the pandemic reminded him and others of how precious life is.\"We know well our youth will not last. It's to remember the precious moments.\"Gawon Bae contributed to this report."

        "link": "https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/08/health/healthy-weight-gain-in-adolescence-wellness/index.html",
        "text": "Editor\u2019s Note:I\u2019ve worked with middle schoolers, their parents and their schools for 20 years to help kids navigate the always awkward, often painful, sometimes hilarious in hindsight, years of early adolescence.Most of the social and development stretch marks we gain during adolescence fade to invisibility over time. We stop holding a grudge against the kid who teased us in class for tripping, or we forgive ourselves our bad haircuts, botched friendships and cringy attempts at popularity.How to talk \u2014 or not talk \u2014 to kids about weightBut one growing pain can be dangerously hard to recover from, and ironically, it\u2019s the one that has most to do with our physical growth.Children are supposed to keep growing in adolescence, and so a child\u2019s changing body during that time should not be cause for concern. Yet it sends adults into a tailspin of fear around weight, health and self-esteem.Kids have always worried about their changing bodies. With so many changes in such a short period of early puberty, they constantly evaluate themselves against each other to figure out if their body development is normal. \u201cAll these guys grew over the summer, but I\u2019m still shorter than all the girls. Is something wrong with me?\u201d \u201cNo one else needs a bra, but I do. Why am I so weird?\u201dBut the worry has gotten worse over the past two decades. I\u2019ve seen parents becoming increasingly worried about how their children\u2019s bodies change during early puberty. When I give talks about parenting, I often hear adults express concern and fear about their children starting to gain \u201ctoo much\u201d weight during early adolescence.Parents I work with worry that even kids who are physically active, engaged with others, bright and happy might need to lose weight because they are heavier than most of their peers.Why are parents so focused on weight? In part, I think it\u2019s because our national conversations about body image and disordered eating have reached a frenzy on the topic. Over the past year, two new angles have further complicated this matter for children.Remember Jimmy Kimmel\u2019s opening monologue at the Oscarsa household name? Whether it\u2019s social media or the mainstream press, small bodies and weight loss are valued. It\u2019s clear to young teens I know thata new way to shrink their bodies.Ozempic prescriptions can be easy to get online. Its popularity for weight loss is hurting those who need it mostConstant messages about being thin and fit are in danger of overexposing kids to health and wellness ideals that are difficult to extract from actual health and wellness.Compound this with the American Academy of Pediatrics recently changingand many parents worry even more that saying or doing nothing about their child\u2019s weight is harmful.The opposite is true. Parents keep their children healthiest when they say nothing about their changing shape. Here\u2019s why.Other than the first year of life, we experience the most growth during adolescence. Between the ages of 13 and 18, most adolescents. Yet weight gain remains a sensitive, sometimes scary subject for parents who fear too much weight gain, too quickly.It helps to understand what\u2019s normal. On average,between 12 and 16. During those four years, they might grow an entire foot and gain as much as 50 to 60 pounds.between 10 and 14. On average, they can gain 10 inches in height and 40 to 50 pounds during that time, according to growth charts from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\u201cIt\u2019s totally normal for kids to gain weight during puberty,\u201d said Dr. Trish Hutchison, a board-certified pediatrician with 30 years of clinical experience and a spokesperson for the American Academy of Pediatrics, via email. \u201cAbout 25 percent of growth in height occurs during this time so as youth grow taller, they\u2019re also going to gain weight. Since the age of two or three, children grow an average of about two inches and gain about five pounds a year. But when puberty hits, that usually doubles.\u201dThe American Academy of Pediatrics released a revised set of guidelines for pediatricians in January, which includedfor some children who measure in the obese range.Updated obesity treatment guidelines for children and teens include medications, surgeryIn contrast, its 2016 guidelines talked about eating disorder prevention and \u201cencouraged pediatricians and parents not to focus on dieting, not to focus on weight, but to focus on health-promoting behaviors,\u201d said Elizabeth Davenport, a registered dietitian in Washington, DC.\u201cThe new guidelines are making weight the focus of health,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd as we know there are many other measures of health.\u201dDavenport said she worries that kids could misunderstand their pediatricians\u2019 discussions about weight, internalize incorrect information and turn to disordered eating.\u201cA kid could certainly interpret that message as not needing to eat as much or there\u2019s something wrong with my body and that leads down a very dangerous path,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat someone could take away is \u2018I need to be on a diet\u2019 and what we know is that dieting increases the risk of developing an eating disorder.\u201dWhat is disordered eating? And why do 20% of the world's kids show signs of it? Experts explainMany tweens have tried dieting, and many parents have put their kids on diets.\u201cSome current statistics show that 51% of 10-year-old girls have tried a diet and 37% of parents admit to having placed their child on a diet,\u201d Hutchison said in an email, adding that dieting could be a concern with the new American Academy of Pediatrics guidelines.\u201cThere is evidence that having conversations about obesity can facilitate effective treatment, but the family\u2019s wishes should strongly direct when these conversations should\u202foccur,\u201d Hutchison said. \u201cThe psychological impact may be more damaging than the physical health risks.\u201dIt\u2019s not that weight isn\u2019t important. \u201cFor kids and teens, we need to know what their weight is,\u201d Davenport said. \u201cWe are not, as dietitians, against kids being weighed because it is a measure to see how they\u2019re growing. If there\u2019s anything outstanding on an adolescent\u2019s growth curve, that means we want to take a look at what\u2019s going on. But we don\u2019t need to discuss weight in front of them.\u201dIn other words, weight is data. It may or may not indicate something needs addressing. The biggest concern, according to Davenport, is when a child isn\u2019t gaining weight. That\u2019s a red flag something unhealthy is going on.Rates of childhood obesity have increased, study finds\u201cObesity is no longer a disease caused by energy in/energy out,\u201d Hutchison said. \u201cIt is much more complex and other factors like genetics, physiological, socioeconomic, and environmental contributors play a role.\u201dIt\u2019s important for parents and caregivers to know that \u201cthe presence of obesity or overweight is NOT an indication of poor parenting,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s not the child or adolescent\u2019s fault.\u201dIt\u2019s also key to note, Hutchison said, that the new American Academy of Pediatrics guidelines, which are only recommendations, are not for parents. They are part of a 100-page document that provides information to health care providers with clinical practice guidelines for the evaluation and treatment of children and adolescents who are overweight or obese. Medications and surgery are discussed in only four pages of the document.Parents need to work on their own weight bias, but they also need to protect their children from providers who don\u2019t know how to communicate with their patients about weight.\u201cWorking in the field of eating disorder treatment for over 20 years, I sadly can\u2019t tell you the number of clients who\u2019ve come in and part of the trigger for their eating disorder was hearing from a medical provider that there was an issue or a concern of some sort with their weight,\u201d Davenport said.I gave up dieting for my kids. Here's whyHutchison said doctors and other health providers need to do better.\u201cWe all have a lot of work to do when it comes to conversations about weight,\u201d Hutchison said. \u201cWe need to approach each child with respect and without (judgment) because we don\u2019t want kids to ever think there is something wrong with their body.\u201dThe right approach, according to American Academy of Pediatrics training, is to ask parents questions that don\u2019t use the word \u201cweight.\u201d One example Hutchison offered: \u201cWhat concerns, if any, do you have about your child\u2019s growth and health?\u201dWorking sensitively, Hutchison said she feels doctors can have a positive impact on kids who need or want guidance toward health-promoting behaviors.Davenport and her business partner in Sunny Side Up Nutrition, with input from the Carolina Resource Center for Eating Disorders, have gotten more specific. They have created a resource calledto give parents steps they can take to ask health care providers to discuss weight only with them \u2014 not with children.\u201cPediatricians are supposed to ask permission to be able to discuss weight in front of children,\u201d Davenport said. \u201cIt\u2019s a parent\u2019s right to ask this and advocate for their child.\u201dDavenport advises parents to call ahead and schedule an appointment to discuss weight before bringing in a child for a visit. She also suggests calling or emailing ahead with your wishes, though she admits it may be less effective in a busy setting. She said to print out a small card to hand to the nurse and physician at the appointment. You can also say in front of the child, \u201cWe prefer not to discuss weight in front of my child.\u201d"

        "link": "https://edition.cnn.com/travel/article/destinus-hypersonic-plane/index.html",
        "text": "It\u2019s now been two decades since the era of supersonic commercial flight ended with Concorde\u2019s final touchdown in an airfield in southwest England.In recent years, numerous pretenders to the throne \u2013 supersonic, hypersonic, hydrogen-powered, with anti-boom technology \u2013 have been whizzing round, conceptually at least, but many of these projects promising seamless super-fast travel have instead stalled, sputtered out or hit delays.Now a European hypersonic startup is having a go, promising enticing journey times such as Frankfurt to Sydney in 4 hours 15, or Memphis to Dubai in 3 hours 30.The Destinus concept is hydrogen-powered flight at five times the speed of sound, cutting flight duration to less than a quarter of current commercial air travel.Headquartered in Switzerland with a team of around 120 staff spread out in Spain, France and Germany, Destinus was established in 2021 but has been hitting milestones fast. Its first two prototypes have made successful test flights and are about to start testing hydrogen-powered flight. Its third prototype \u2013 Destinus 3 \u2013 is set to make its inaugural flight by the end of the year.Martina L\u00f6fqvist, the company\u2019s business development manager, caught up with CNN over video call to explain its model and why the team hopes it can be the one to finally usher in the new age of hypersonic travel.\u201cThere are different approaches to doing this,\u201d says L\u00f6fqvist. While other top contenders in the field such as Boom Supersonic are \u201cfocusing more on the development of the mockups and understanding of how it works and trying to get these piloted aircraft working, we\u2019re going directly to autonomous flights.\u201d The strategy is to \u201cdevelop smaller-size drones before we scale it up to become a large pilot-driven or passenger-carrying aircraft.\u201dHydrogen is the Destinus fuel of choice due to it being a clean, renewable energy source, increasingly inexpensive to produce, and capable of helping it realize its speed and long-range ambitions. Hydrogen-powered aviation is still in its infancy, with hydrogen jet engines yet to enter commercial use. Airbus is developing a hydrogen jet engine it says will begin.\u201cWe try to go very, very ultra-long range with our vehicles,\u201d says L\u00f6fqvist, \u201cand that is to fly from Europe all the way to Australia at Mach 5. Using kerosene means that the vehicle would become quite heavy, while hydrogen is very light in comparison.\u201d Hydrogen also has higher energy density than traditional jet fuel.The long-term goal is to fully hydrogen-powered and zero emissions, but while hydrogen production is still scaling up, its short-term plan is to power takeoff with Jet A \u2013 conventional aviation fuel \u2013 and then switch when they hit speeds of around Mach 3 \u201cbecause hydrogen doesn\u2019t really become useful or better than Jet A until you get up to supersonic speeds.\u201dPaper airplane designed by Boeing engineers breaks world distance recordThe Destinus prototypes are blended-body planes in the waverider shape \u2014 a hypersonic design first conceived in the 1950s but never yet reaching production \u2014 with the company\u2019s Swiss/French origins being reflected in paintwork inspired by the Alps.The now classic shape has \u201cbeen studied for many, many, many years,\u201d says L\u00f6fqvist. \u201cThe purpose of it is so that you can ride on top of the shock waves that are generated from the vehicle itself. It\u2019s a pretty efficient shape where you can use less fuel to fly through it because you have less resistance with the air.\u201dNaturally, with every new prototype Destinus is refining and adjusting the design. Two decades from now, the team expects the crafts it\u2019s working with to look a little different from the models it\u2019s testing now.The upcoming prototype, Destinus 3, will be supersonic and the hope is for it to achieve supersonic hydrogen-powered flight in 2024. \u201cThis is a pretty massive vehicle,\u201d says L\u00f6fqvist. \u201cIt\u2019s about the same size as the previous prototype in terms of being around 10 meters (long), but it\u2019s 10 times heavier, and probably 20 times more complex as well, in terms of the structure and in terms of the propulsion system.\u201dThe hoped-for timeline is that by the 2030s the company will be able to launch a smaller-scale aircraft, holding around 25 passengers, which will have some limitation in terms of range and be fully focused on business class customers.By the 2040s, its fully scaled-up version will have multiple classes, including economy. They\u2019re hoping that by then \u201chydrogen prices will drop significantly, so that we can then reduce the prices of the flights, significantly as well, for these ultra-long-range flights.\u201dHow this airport was transformed into a spaceportThe company\u2019s plans are quite dependent on the vagaries of the hydrogen market, which L\u00f6fqvist freely admits it\u2019s not in control of, but experts inside and outside of the company have advised that they estimate prices to drop.Last month Destinus acquired Dutch company OPRA, now named Destinus Energy. Says L\u00f6fqvist, \u201cThis means that we can have revenues already this year, because they already have gas turbines that are built and being sold. We\u2019ll have now not just that hypersonic airplane aerospace side, but we\u2019ll also have some of these energy aspects within the company as well.\u201dIn addition to the private investment and public funding it already obtained \u2013 in April 2023 it secured grants worth 26.7 million euros ($29.4 million) from the Spanish government to expand its hydrogen propulsion capabilities \u2013 Destinus hopes this additional revenue will help it weather the challenges that have seen other supersonic and hypersonic projects fall to the wayside. L\u00f6fqvist emphasizes that the company is aiming for a \u201crealistic\u201d approach \u201cnow that the funding environment is a bit tougher.\u201dNevada-based Aerion, which was a major contender in the race to be the first to build a supersonic passenger jet, collapsed in May 2021, declaring that \u201cin the current financial environment, it has proven hugely challenging to close on the scheduled and necessary large new capital requirements.\u201dAs for whether we\u2019ll be hopping on hypersonic jets by the 2040s, breakfasting in Shanghai and hitting Sao Paulo just after lunch, there may be a few technological, environmental and financial hurdles to overcome before then. But it won\u2019t be want for trying."

        "text": "Written byActress and body positivity advocateJameela Jamilhas criticized theMet Galafor celebratingKarl Lagerfeld\u2014the influential fashion designer who died in 2019.Jamil, best known for starring in NBC's \"The Good Place,\" wrote onInstagramthat \"Hollywood and fashion said the quiet part out loud when a lot of famous feminists chose to celebrate at the highest level, a man who was so publicly cruel to women, to fat people, to immigrants and to sexual assault survivors.\"Met Gala 2023 fashion: The best looks from the red carpetThe gala's theme this year coincided with an exhibition at the Metropolitan Museum of Art's Costume Institute, titled \"Karl Lagerfeld: A Line of Beauty,\" which a Met spokesperson told CNN aligned with the museum's \"mission to explore art and creativity from the ancient times through today, and to examine moments of great importance and impact so we can gain a deeper understanding of art and history and invite dialogue and further reflection.\"This year's Costume Institute exhibition does just that, by presenting the work of a singularly impactful designer\u2014Karl Lagerfeld\u2014whose innovation and unique working methodology have made undeniably seismic contributions to the worlds of both fashion and art.\"CNN also reached out to Vogue, which organizes the gala, for comment.Celebrities, fashion elite and New York's high society walked the famous red carpet at the Metropolitan Museum of Art on Monday, wearing extravagant outfits that paid homage to Lagerfeld, who was best known for transforming Chanel into one of the world's most valuable fashion houses during his time as its creative director.But for all his influence as a designer, he was also a controversial figure, making a number of disparaging statements that upheld narrow standards of beauty or cast criticism on the #MeToo movement.Who is Karl Lagerfeld, the controversial and pioneering designer inspiring this year's Met Gala dress code?He also sparked outrage in 2017 when he criticized then-German Chancellor Angela Merkel for offering refuge to people fleeing conflict.\"This isn't about cancel culture,\" Jamil added in a caption, explaining her post. \"It's not even about Karl. It's about showing how selective cancel culture is within liberal politics, in the most blatant way so far.\"She added that \"slippery tactics and double standards like this\" contribute to an erosion of trust toward liberals.Jamil, whose body positivity Instagram account \"I Weigh\" has more than a million followers, previously criticized the Met Gala in October, calling the theme a \"disappointing double standard\" in the industry and pointing out that Lagerfeld's comments were recent."

But jollof recipes can vary within the same country, too.The dish is said to have originated in Senegal, but the debate over who makes the best jollof on the continent and across the diaspora will never end.World's best spicy foods: 20 dishes to tryFound in various iterations all over China, zongzi refers to sticky, glutinous rice dumplings wrapped in bamboo leaves before boiling that can be stuffed with savory or sweet fillings.And while anything that is wrapped with a skin and has a stuffing is considered a dumpling, says Nadia Liu Spellman, author ofthe Chinese put zongzi is a category of its own.Typical zongzi fillings in southern China include salted duck egg and pork belly while sweeter fillings such as red bean paste and tapioca are more common in the north of the country.\u201cEvery family recipe has their own secrets that they believe make their zongzi superior,\u201d Spellman says.A stovetop staple at many a German\u2019s house, milchreis (translation: milk rice), is a creamy rice pudding made from arborio, medium or long grain white rice that\u2019s sweetened with cinnamon and sugar and splashed with vanilla extract.It can be enjoyed warm, straight from the stovetop, or chilled. It\u2019s a nostalgic childhood snack that\u2019s often enjoyed by adults across Germany, too. You can even buy pre-made containers of milchreis in the refrigerated sections of German grocery stores.Far from the only country to concoct a sweet treat featuring rice and milk, German milchreis is joined by Lebanese meghli, Indian kheer, Portuguese arroz doce, Latin American arroz con leche and many, many more in the rice pudding family.A gift to global gastronomy, Spain\u2019s main rice player is paella, the famous dish from Valencia that originated as a peasant food and is typically made using bomba rice, which maintains its firmness while absorbing the broth while cooking.The dish was originally invented in rural areas and made use of whatever ingredients were available, including rice, chicken, rabbit and snails mixed with saffron, olive oil and the vegetables of the season, says Patricia Palacios of Spain travel website,.\u201cToday, there are many different paella recipes,\u201d she told CNN Travel. \u201cAlong the coast, fish and seafood paellas are very popular. Vegetarian paellas are also common. But most Spaniards would agree that a big no-no with paellas is mixing meat and fish/seafood.\u201dMaking Italy\u2019s most famous rice dish is an art form that requires near constant stirring on the part of the cook. And any Italian will tell you risotto must be(translation: on the wave) \u2013 with a texture that undulates enough to fall off the spoon without ever taking on the dreaded globby consistency.With its high starch content, arborio rice is most commonly used in making the dish, typically served as a first course in Italy.\u201cis comfort food,\u201d says Calabria-born cookbook author Francesca Montillo, who leadsin Italy. \u201cIt\u2019s not necessarily an easy dish to prepare, so it also speaks to the skills of the chef or home cook preparing it.\u201dThe traditional preparation, Montillo says, involves first toasting the rice then adding wine as it cooks in the broth, with butter and grated cheese added later. Variations include adding peas, mushrooms, asparagus and ham, among other ingredients.Sicily\u2019s most famous street food is the rice ball whose name comes from the orange citrus fruit it resembles in shape and color. Arancini is essentially stuffed rice balls that are breaded and fried, says Montillo. And Sicilians debate the dish\u2019s name.\u201cIn Palermo, it\u2019s typically round and the name is arancina,\u201d she says. \u201cIn Catania, it\u2019s cone-shaped, some say to resemble the local Etna volcano, and it\u2019s called arancino.\u201dYou can find the dish all over Sicily as well as on mainland Italy, but arancini are particularly linked to Siracusa\u2019s Festa di Santa Lucia (Feast Day of St. Lucia), celebrated every year on December 13. The balls are usually stuffed with meat sauce, says Montillo, and other fillings might include peas, mozzarella, prosciutto, spinach and eggplant in tomato sauce (\u201calla Norma\u201d).25 delicious Italian dishes you might not knowBeloved across the Indian subcontinent and said to have originated in Iran (means \u201cfried rice\u201d in Persian), biryani is almost always on the menu for special occasions in India, says cookbook author.\u201cIt is a rich and elaborate preparation, made by layering partially cooked basmati rice with vegetables/lamb/chicken/fish in a sauce that is flavored with exotic spices and aromatics,\u201d she said.The pot is then covered and sealed with dough or a wet cloth that stops the steam from escaping while the biryani cooks over a low flame. Typical biryani spices include a wide aromatic mix, among them fennel seeds, mace, cardamom, bay leaves, coriander and garlic.Afghanistan\u2019s most famous rice dish, Kabuli pulao is a pilaf-style specialty. Served in many countries, rice pilaf is a loose-grain dish often cooked in stock with spices, onions and other ingredients.Kabuli pulao is served piled high atop a platter and redolent with slow-cooked lamb and a blend of spices (cardamom pods, cloves, cinnamon and cumin among them), mixed with a long grain rice such as basmati.The dish is usually topped with julienned carrots, raisins and toasted almonds. Kabuli pulao takes its name from the Afghani capital, Kabul, but is also enjoyed in neighboring Pakistan.Sushi\u2019s popularity precedes it. But just as dear to the Japanese is onigiri, a staple bento box snack made from steamed Japanese rice shaped into a triangular form and wrapped with the seaweed called nori.\u201cDespite its integral significance in Japanese culture, it is still an uncommon novelty in the United States, even in a metropolis such as New York,\u201d says Ricky Dolinsky, co-owner and chef at New York City cocktail bar, which has styles of onigiri on its speakeasy menu.Onigiri is special, he says, because of its convenience and affordability. \u201cOnigiri reigns supreme in Japan,\u201d says Dolinsky. \u201cWhether it\u2019s a quick grab-and-go on the way to work, or prepared at home for a lunch bento box.\u201dFrom chow mein to udon: A beginner's guide to Asia's best noodlesNasi goreng translates to \u201cfried rice\u201d in the Indonesian and Malay languages and is an inexpensive and filling comfort staple served at street stalls and restaurants across the Indonesian archipelago, everywhere from Jakarta\u2019s markets and Bali\u2019s backpacker hangouts to the streets of Sumatra.Mixing sweet and salty flavors, the dish is made from long grain rice flavored with a spice blend called bumbu (with shrimp paste, ginger, candlenut and other ingredients) and the sweet Indonesian soy sauce called kecap manis.Variations of nasi goreng, which is considered a comfort food in Indonesia, incorporate eggs, shrimp and chicken. It\u2019s often enjoyed with a side of spicy sambal sauce.Fans of crispy rice will enjoy this Persian specialty typically made with basmati rice, yogurt, saffron and sometimes an egg yolk. Tahdig means \u201cbottom of the pot,\u201d referring to the dish\u2019s crispy golden bottom of cooked rice that pairs perfectly with its fluffy interior.Cooking fat on the bottom of the rice pan helps ensure the tahdig gets pan-fried below while cooking, while staying light and steamy up top. Saffron threads give it its golden glow.Said to have been a favorite of Queen Victoria, the Anglo-Indian dish called kedgeree traces its roots to the far more ancient spiced lentil Indian dish, khichiri, which dates to the 14th century.A popular British comfort food today, kedgeree blends smoked haddock filet with basmati rice, hard boiled eggs and spices such as cumin, coriander and turmeric (the fish and eggs reflect the taste preferences of the British Raj, who appropriated khichiri to their palates).One of Cuba\u2019s classic comfort rice dishes, arroz imperial is prepared for special occasions on the island and among the diaspora in Miami and elsewhere, too. It\u2019s assembled in layers, much in the same way as lasagna.Satisfying enough to be served as a main dish, it\u2019s typically layered with yellow rice, shredded chicken, mayonnaise (to help bind it and for flavor) and cheese and is sometimes baked before serving for a melted effect. Olives, tomatoes and peppers are popular additions.A one-pot comfort food ubiquitous in the dual-island Caribbean nation of Trinidad and Tobago, pelau is an everyday dish best shared with friends and family, says Jeanine Prime, the owner of Trinidadian restaurantin Washington, DC.To make it, she says, rice, peas and animal proteins (usually chicken) are caramelized and then cooked with stock, coconut milk and spices. The dish is often the centerpiece at social gatherings on the islands because it\u2019s so filling.\u201cPeople eat it while hanging out at the beach, while taking in a cricket match, or even at dinner parties,\u201d says Prime, who was born and raised in Trinidad. \u201cIt is to Trinidadians what jollof is to Ghanaians and Nigerians.\u201dAlso called Cajun dirty rice, this Louisiana classic preferably made from long grain rice from the marshes of southern Louisiana is enjoyed across the state \u2013 from the tables of home cooks in Lake Charles and Baton Rouge to cafeteria-style diners and upscale restaurants in New Orleans.It\u2019s as typical a side dish in these parts as mashed potatoes are elsewhere in the country. In traditional recipes, chopped chicken livers or gizzards give the white rice its \u201cdirty\u201d color.Not to be mistaken for the popular Creole dish, jambalaya, dirty rice can also be made using ground beef and ground pork (if you don\u2019t like innards) to give the rice its distinctive look.Wali wa kukaanga is Kenya\u2019s answer to fried rice, and translates to just that in Swahili.Served alongside a meat dish or all on its own, it\u2019s a straightforward meal that\u2019s easy to prepare from common ingredients and consists of boiled rice fried together in oil with turmeric and a mix of chopped vegetables that might include onions, carrots, peas and corn.Carolina Gold Rice is the preferred grain for preparing chicken perloo (also called perlo or purloo), a quintessential South Carolina Lowcountry dish that traces its roots to West Africa and the slave trade.With similarities to paella and jollof, the dish consists of a protein simmered with rice, tomatoes, onion, garlic, celery, bell peppers and spices.\u201cPerloo\u2019s importance \u2013 as with so much regional cuisine throughout the South \u2013 is that it reflects the blending of cultures from Africa and Europe that make this dish so unique to the South Carolina Lowcountry,\u201d saidexecutive chef, John Ondo, in an email to CNN Travel.The dish varies depending on where you are in the Lowcountry, he said, with less tomato used farther north.\u201cGullah and Geechee cooks who make Perloo stick to tradition, passing these family recipes down from generation to generation,\u201d he says. \u201cThe result is that there are as many subtle variations for Perloo recipes as there are cooks and ways to spell it.\u201dCoconut figures big in the cuisine of tropical Samoa, from coconut rolls and bread to coconut cookies and meat and vegetable dishes that incorporate the milk.So it\u2019s no surprise that the Polynesian island country\u2019s most popular rice dish, alaisa fa\u2019apopo, has ties to the coconut, too. A popular savory snack, it\u2019s made from coconut cream mixed with steamy salted rice and is often served with coffee or a cup of koko Samoa (Samoan hot chocolate).This wildly popular Korean dish whose name translates to \u201cmixed rice\u201d has gained fame around the globe and consists of rice served in a bowl and topped with a colorful array of individually prepared meats and artfully sliced vegetables.The city of Jeonju in western South Korea, where the rice is cooked in a broth made from beef brisket, is the most famous place to try it. The dish is often served with the Korean hot chili condiment called Yak-gochujang.Korean food: 40 best dishes we can't live withoutWhen it comes to fried rice, the Chinese version tends to steal the spotlight. But Thai fried rice, called khao pad, is just as worthy of acclaim and a similar staple at home tables (not to mention from street food vendors) in the southeast Asian country.Hom mali \u2013Thai jasmine rice that\u2019s considered the \u201cChampagne of rice\u201d \u2013 serves as the base for the dish, says Thailand-born chef Vanda Asapahu of Los Angeles restaurant.\u201cLayering of flavors is important in Thai food and extends to its fried rice,\u201d she says, noting the importance of balancing salty and sweet. \u201cYou also need a hot wok and good eggs, and for sure white pepper and scallions to finish off the dish, all of which are basic essentials in a Thai kitchen.\u201d"

        "text": "Written byLuxury giant Louis Vuitton further demonstrated South Korea's status as a fashion force by transforming Seoul's Jamsugyo Bridge into a striking outdoor runway on a chilly Saturday evening.Hosting its first womenswear show in the country, the French label unveiled its Pre-fall 2023 collection by sending scores of models across the Han River before a star-studded audience.The event marked a major moment for Louis Vuitton \u2014 not least because the brand has never previously unveiled a Pre-fall collection via runway show. (Falling outside the usual Fashion Week calendar, Pre-fall designs are often more commercial than Spring-Summer or Fall-Winter collections, and therefore usually promoted via glossy campaign photos).But this was also a milestone for Seoul itself. Despite South Korea's booming luxury market, its capital has yet to emerge as a routine stop on the fashion industry's packed schedule. Such was the excitement surrounding Saturday's show that proceedings were livestreamed to passersby on large screens in the city center.The best street style from Seoul Fashion WeekDescribed by the Maison as a \"tale of to and fro\" and \"transformation,\" the new collection was varied in style and material: bold, primary-colored jackets were tucked into A-line studded miniskirts. Elsewhere, looser, flowy silhouettes yielded a bit of romance. Model and \"Squid Game\" star Jung Hoyeon opened the show.Model and actor Jung Hoyeon walks the  Louis Vuitton Pre-fall show on April 29, 2023 in Seoul, South Korea.Hoyeon Jung is the first Korean to appear solo on the cover of VogueSeoul's government has (along with the Korea Tourism Organization) signed a long-term partnership with Louis Vuitton. The initiative forms part of a major drive to promote the city \u2014 and the river cutting through it. With the audience facing out towards the water, and the runway itself just a few feet from the bridge's railings, the location made for a picturesque backdrop, the cityscape illuminated in the distance.A model walks the runway over looking the Hangang River.K-pop, K-beauty and K-drama have been among the biggest cultural phenomena of recent years \u2014 and fittingly, scenography at Saturday's show was overseen byHwang Dong-Hyuk, director of the Netflix hit \"Squid Game.\" With deep blue lighting effects and an aquatic-themed pre-show soundtrack, (which included what sounded like whale calls), his production was seemingly inspired by the river below. Chloe Grace Moretz, Jaden Smith and Bae Doona were among the stars in attendance (where they were joined by around 100 local fashion students, there by special invitation from Louis Vuitton).Why K-pop rules fashion weekLike many in the audience, 32-year-old writer and influencer Gong Linxuan remarked how cold he was, but told CNN the experience was \"amazing.\" \"It's like being in a TV show,\" he said, gesturing to streams of water \u2014 which were not part of the set design \u2014 shooting off the bridge. Gong added that he thought the collection itself was \"beautiful... quite easy to wear.\" Meanwhile another spectator, Anna Hyewon, said she was excited to see the show hosted in her home country. \"It's dreamy ... it's very special.\"Members of K-pop girl band Le Sserafim were among celebrities attending the Louis Vuitton show on April 29, 2023 in Seoul, South Korea.The event was masterminded by the fashion house's artistic director for womenswear, Nicolas Ghesqui\u00e8re, who has staged shows at venues ranging from the Louvre to New York's JFK Airport during his decade at the helm.The decision to host a runway showcase in Seoul comes as European fashion houses look to strengthen their hold on the country's luxury market. Earlier this year, investment bank Morgan Stanley revealed that South Koreans are now the world's biggest luxury shoppers, with an annual spend of $325 per capita.Louis Vuitton has been a major beneficiary. News agencyYonhapreported that regulatory filings showed the label's Korean arm had grown its annual net income to 380 billion won ($284 million) in 2022, up by almost 69% on the previous year.Louis Vuitton has massively expanded its presence in South Korea since opening its first boutique in Seoul in 1991. The label now lists 35 stores across the country, including a sculptural glass-fronted flagship, designed by celebrated architect Frank Gehry in Seoul's upmarket Gangnam district. Two years ago, the late Virgil Abloh (then the brand's artistic director of menswear) staged a \"spin-off\" show in the city for Louis Vuitton's Fall 2021 Mens collection.Deep blue lighting effects and an aquatic-themed pre-show soundtrack were seemingly inspired by the river below.The brand's presence in the country has been bolstered by a wave of partnerships with high-profile musicians and actors. Among the stars representing the label in recent years are Jung, who was the first Korean to appear solo on the cover of American Vogue, and K-pop singer Hyein of the up-and-coming girl group NewJeans.How K-pop group NewJeans became an overnight fashion favoriteKorea's biggest musical export, BTS, has also worked with the label. The seven-piece even attended the2022 Grammy Awardsdressed in a selection of complementary Louis Vuitton suits. After the group announced it was going on hiatus last year \u2014 as its members serve, or prepare to serve, their mandatory military service \u2014 one of the band's rappers, J-Hope was appointed as a Louis Vuitton brand ambassador as he pursues his solo career. (His band mate Jimin has meanwhile been signed by jeweler Tiffany & Co, which is owned by Louis Vuitton's parent company, LVMH).Other brands looking to capitalize on South Korea's growing cultural cache include Dior, whichhostedits first ever show in the country last year. French fashion houses Celine, Chanel and Saint Laurent have all, along with Dior, appointed members of girl group Blackpink as brand ambassadors."

CNN retains full editorial control over subject matter, reporting and frequency of the articles and videos within the sponsorship, in compliance with.Whether it\u2019s aor a, space tourism entrepreneurs believe one day we\u2019ll all be opting for out-of-this-world vacations.The team behind Moon World Resorts reckon so too \u2013 sort of.They want to build a series of gigantic dome-like hotels resembling the moon, sitting here on planet Earth. More precisely, in Dubai.Each sphere will be a 360-degree recreation of the moon on a grand scale, complete with realistic-looking craters and texture. Each recreated moon could tower 735 feet high (224 meters) with a 2,042 foot circumference, depending on location and planning permissions.Canada-based entrepreneur Michael R. Henderson, co-founder of Moon World Resorts, tells CNN Travel that the crux of the project is the moon is a \u201crecognizable brand.\u201d\u201cSeven and a half billion people know it, everybody loves it,\u201d he says.According to Henderson, each Moon World Resort will be \u201ca very luxurious and contemporary, fully integrated destination resort, with a lot of components inside that one would already know\u201d \u2013 for example, a convention center, restaurants, spa, each with a lunar twist.Artist renderings envisage spaceship-style interiors and themed entertainment \u2013 including what Henderson envisages as the attraction\u2019s highlight, an experience that replicates what it\u2019s like to walk on the moon.\u201cWe will give you the ability in your lifetime to walk on what you will believe to be the lunar surface,\u201d says Henderson.Moon World Resorts has been in the works for two decades, a time line that Henderson, who previously founded a medical services company, suggests matches the slower pace associated with space tourism more generally.The project comes with \u201ctremendous technical challenges,\u201d Henderson explains, but he and co-founder Sandra G. Matthews are working with independent engineers and architects to make the concept a reality.\u201cWe basically have a plethora of groups around the world who we just pull in, as we need them. But obviously, once the project actually starts to build, then they will be located in a particular region,\u201d he says.The long term goal is to build four Moon resorts, one in North America, one in Europe, one in the Middle East and Northern Africa and one in Asia. Moon World Resorts is a licensing company, so Henderson envisages licensing each Moon World Resort to licensees with cash to splash.The UAE, and specifically Dubai, has been pinpointed by the company as a \u201cfront runner\u201d for the opening of the first Moon World resort. Henderson says this is because the UAE is \u201cvery popular for tourists\u201d and home to \u201ca lot of infrastructure\u201d projects.However Henderson also suggests there are \u201cother options popping up,\u201d declining to share more for now.Space tourism currently comes with a hefty price tag, and for the time being it\u2019s a barrier to entry for most travelers. Virgin Galactic, for example, has.Henderson says the Moon World Resort experience will be significantly cheaper, suggesting signing up to walk the resort\u2019s \u201clunar surface\u201d will cost guests US$500.Cost can also prevent futuristic projects like Moon World Resorts from ever moving past the conceptual stage, but Henderson suggests the licensing model makes the project viable.\u201cIt\u2019s not so much looking for capital,\u201d he explains. \u201cThe goal for a licensor, like us, is to find the licensee. And so once once you secure the licensee, then you\u2019ve the money for the projects already there \u2013 because we\u2019re not talking about small companies, these will be major international corporations.\u201dHenderson hopes the first licensee, who will be expected to invest US$5 billion on the build out, will be secured by the end of 2022. He foresees the first Moon World resort opening five years later, in 2027.Henderson hopes each Moon World Resort will become a destination in its own right. Even if people aren\u2019t staying there, or checking out the space age facilities, he envisages travelers going simply to gawp at the building.He name checks architectural structures like the Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao, or the Burj Khalifa in Dubai, as inspiration on this front,\u201cObviously people like to see the renderings of what\u2019s happening on the inside. But I think a lot of people are going to be excited when you look up at the world\u2019s largest sphere \u2013 I think that\u2019s going to be the mind blower,\u201d he says."

They married in November 2018, and Richard gave birth to their son, Levi, in March 2022.Richard decided to hire Chan, who lived with the family for a month and spent an additional month helping out.Richard vlogged about her experience with Chan, and that video went viral with 2.9 million views. The reaction was mostly admiration and praise from Richard\u2019s primarily Western followers.The concept of Chinese confinement \u2014 \u201czuo yue zi,\u201d or \u201csitting the month\u201d\u2014 is when a new mother stays at home for one month to allow her body to rest after giving birth.During that time, the pui yuet makes dishes catering to the mother\u2019s physical needs and helps her with milk production and other concerns. The pui yuet also cares for the mother with massage, body wraps and lessons on how to take care of the new baby.Richard and Chan declined to share the cost of Chan\u2019s services.Few entities track the pricing of nannies in Hong Kong on a consistent basis because most negotiations are directly between clients and the nannies.The estimated cost for a pui yuet in Hong Kong ranges from 63,800 Hong Kong dollars (US $8,100) to 268,000 Hong Kong dollars (US $34,100) for 26 to 30 nights for a live-in nanny, according to, a statutory body in Hong Kong dedicated to protecting consumer rights. The council, which surveyed 19 companies or organizations that provide postnatal care, also reported that the cost of a pui yuet working eight hours a day for 26 days ranges from 21,000 Hong Kong dollars (US $2,600) to 34,000 Hong Kong dollars (US $4,300).This tradition isn\u2019t without criticism, and some have questioned whether the traditional methods of confinement in the Chinese community are too extreme and may be dangerous. In 2015,following the custom died of heatstroke after wrapping herself in a quilt and turning off the air conditioner,.In recent years, some people have adapted the tradition to more modern ways, taking advantage of available technology. It\u2019s important to turn the air conditioner on when the weather is hot, Chan said, or else you could get sick. The traditional practice had been to avoid anything cold regardless of the weather.Why you are not a failure as a motherRichard, now 34, said she loved the time she spent with Chan.\u201cIt meant everything! My husband and I both don\u2019t have any family members in Hong Kong, and as new parents we were pretty clueless,\u201d she said via email. \u201cHaving someone take care of my body and gently guide me through my transition into motherhood made for a very positive beginning of my baby\u2019s life. I\u2019m forever grateful for Carol!\u201dRichard was the first Western mother whom Chan cared for in her 12-year career. But since Richard\u2019s YouTube video went viral, Chan said she\u2019s gotten calls from Westerners asking for her services from as far away as the United States and United Kingdom. She\u2019s now headed to Vancouver, British Columbia, in July to work as a pui yuet for a family there for a month.The kind of care Richard received is expensive, whether the new parents live in Hong Kong or elsewhere. One US  location, Boram Postnatal Retreat, opened last year in New York City.\u201cIt was very challenging to get the concept received by others,\u201d cofounder Boram Nam told CNN. \u201cIt was a lot about the education process \u2014 information is abundant up to until you give birth, and the spotlight completely shifts over to the baby \u2014 so we get into that discussion, and people get it.\u201dBut her program comes with a hefty price tag, starting at three nights for $2700.\u201cThis is the price we do need to charge for the level of service that we provide within the guidelines of what postpartum care looks like in the US,\u201d said Nam, adding that she hopes eventually to get services covered by insurance. \u201cWe want to make sure this can be accessible by others, by more women, a more diverse group of people.\u201dMandy Major, owner of Major Care, a virtual postpartum doula service based in the US, has noticed a lack of postpartum education in her country.\u201cWe have a lack of systematic postpartum here within our health care system,\u201d Major said. \u201cWe have a go-go, hyper-productive, hyper-independent culture, but we also don\u2019t have paid leave.\u201dLife-threatening pregnancy and childbirth risks can vary depending on where you live, study findsRichard\u2019s mostly Western followers on YouTube noted that pressure, commenting on the luxury of taking a month off to spend time recovering and connecting with their babies.\u201cAs an American woman who has given birth 4 times and been booted immediately out of the hospital expected to figure it all out on my own, I can undoubtedly say had this been an option, it may have changed my whole mothering experiences!!\u201d one person said.\u201cI returned to work 2 weeks postpartum in America,\u201d another mother wrote. \u201cI never felt that I was able to fully bond with my child.\u201dThe month of confinement came to an end for Richard last April. In Richard\u2019s YouTube video, Chan holds Levi one last time and passes him back to his mother as she put her shoes on to leave.Photographers capture their own experiences as mothersRichard\u2019s eyes begin to fill with tears, surprising herself at her emotional reaction.\u201cI feel like I\u2019m losing a family member,\u201d she says as the door slowly closes behind Chan, according to the video.Even after the confinement experience, Chan remains close with Richard\u2019s family, stopping by for lunch occasionally and still giving baby advice.\u201cIf I have another baby, I would love to have it in Canada with my family, but I want Carol to come with me if I do!\u201d Richard said in a video chat later, smiling. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine going through this again without her.\u201d"

The King and Queen waved to huge crowds outside the royal residence, joined by \u201cworking royals\u201d and their children, among others.The balcony moment, which featured a slimmed-down flypast by the Royal Air Force, has become a flagship part of royal occasions. Prince Andrew wasn\u2019t present either.Earlier Saturday, Prince Harry was among the first group of royals to enter, arriving alongside his uncles, Prince Edward and Prince Andrew, and two of his cousins, Princess Beatrice and Princess Eugenie.Harry, wearing a morning suit and medals, sat within the third row of the service. Both are non-working royals and did not perform any duties during the ceremony.He did not join members of his family to ride in an impressive procession back to the palace. Instead, he got into a car alone and departed the abbey shortly after the service had ended.The King\u2019s youngest son had reportedly returned to London on Friday. His wife, Meghan, stayed behind in the California with their children to celebrate Prince Archie\u2019s fourth birthday.There was widespread speculation in the build-up to Saturday\u2019s celebrations over whether Harry would have a role in proceedings \u2013 and if his return might suggest the family has moved on from the rift that saw the Sussexes step back from their role as senior members of the royal family.Harry launched a series ofagainst members of his family in \u201cSpare,\u201d in which he recalled a number of private confrontations between him and other senior royals and detailed his split from the family.Among the most explosive claims in the autobiography, published January, was Harry\u2019s allegation that his older brother, Prince William, knocked him onto the floor during an argument over Meghan.CNN royal historian Kate Williams previously described Harry\u2019s appearance at the coronation as a \u201cflying visit.\u201d\u201c[Prince Harry] is coming for this major event of his father\u2019s coronation but it\u2019s not going to be a family reunion. We\u2019re not going to see lots of big family meet-ups. Certainly, there has been damage done,\u201d she explained.Williams added that Harry\u2019s presence was a \u201cshow of unity\u201d \u2013 but the extent of that unity remains to be seen.CNN\u2019s David Wilkinson and Jessie Gretener contributed to this story."

        "text": "Senate Judiciary Chair Dick Durbin said Sunday that \u201ceverything is on the table\u201d as the panel scrutinizes new ethics concerns around.\u201cThe bottom line is this: Everything is on the table. Day after day, week after week, more and more disclosures about Justice Thomas \u2013 we cannot ignore them,\u201d the Illinois Democrat told CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper on \u201cState of the Union.\u201d\u201cThe thing we\u2019re going to do first, obviously, is to gather the evidence, the information that we need to draw our conclusions. I\u2019m not ruling out anything,\u201d he added.ProPublica reported recently that, for years, Thomas hasfrom GOP megadonor Harlan Crow, which have gone mostly unreported on the justice\u2019s financial disclosures. Crow also purchased several real estate properties, including, from the Thomas family andfor Thomas\u2019 grandnephew, according to ProPublica.The extent to which these transactions and hospitality should have been reported by Thomas has been the subject of debate among judicial ethics experts, who have noted that a recently closed loophole for certain \u201cpersonal hospitality\u201d may have covered some of the luxury trips.Thomas has said he followed the advice of others in deciding what required disclosure and, in a statement last month, noted that that Crow did not have business before the court.But Durbin said Sunday the recent revelations \u201cjust embarrasses me\u201d as he called on Chief Justice John Roberts to impose a code of conduct on the court. Roberts previously declined Durbin\u2019s request to voluntarily testify in a hearing on Supreme Court ethics.\u201cI must respectfully decline your invitation,\u201d Roberts wrote in a letter to Durbin, which was released by a spokesperson for the high court. \u201cTestimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee by the Chief Justice of the United States is exceedingly rare as one might expect in light of separation of powers concerns and the importance of preserving judicial independence.\u201dThe debate over Supreme Court ethics was the subject of a Senate Judiciarythat featured testimony from a law professor, legal advocates and two former judges. Some Republican lawmakers said they want to see more transparency around the court, though they railed against the Democratic push for Congress to impose a code of conduct on the justices.Durbin maintained Sunday that \u201cthis is the Roberts court, and history is going to judge him by the decision he makes on this.\u201d\u201cHe has the power to make the difference.\u201dDurbin made clear Sunday that he hasn\u2019t reached \u201cany conclusion\u201d on pursuing subpoenas in relation toSupreme Court ethics issues, but he acknowledged that the absence of Democratic Sen. Diane Feinstein of California would pose a challenge to the committee \u201cif we go down that path.\u201d\u201cRight now, with her absence, it\u2019s a 10-to-10 Committee, and the majority is not there, and a proxy vote doesn\u2019t count in this circumstance,\u201d Durbin said.Feinstein, 89, has been away from the Senate since March as she recovers at home in California from shingles. Her absence has prevented the committee from advancing certain judicial nominees ofand several House Democrats have called on her to resign as a result.In a statement last week, Feinstein, saying that the Senate continues to \u201cswiftly\u201d confirm \u201chighly qualified individuals to the federal judiciary.\u201d She indicated in the statement that she still plans to return but did not say when that would happen.\u201cShe\u2019s gone through an awful lot. She lost her husband last year, and she\u2019s had some real medical issues that are problematic for her at her age at this point,\u201d Durbin said. \u201cI hope she returns, and I hope it\u2019s this week. We need her. It is a challenge in the Senate Judiciary Committee to do our business.\u201dThe situation, he added, is \u201ccomplicated.\u201d\u201cI hope she does what\u2019s best for her and her family and the state of California and makes a decision soon as to whether she\u2019s coming back,\u201d Durbin said."

It was unbelievable.\u201dRichie then mused about what could be done \u201cto bring something different to the show,\u201d before the King and Queen wandered into the shot. \u201cI just wanted to check how long you\u2019ll be using this room for?\u201d Charles joked before thanking him and fellow headliner Katy Perry for their performances.Crowds were thrilled to see two of their favorite little royals, Prince George and, sat with their parents, enjoying the spectacle.

        "text": "Ukraine\u2019s assertion that atook out one of Russia\u2019s most modern ballistic missiles is a notable moment in the conflict, now in its 15th month,Russian President Vladimir Putin and the Russian military have touted the Kinzhal, or Kh-47, as an example of Russia\u2019s modernized missile arsenal, claiming that itsmakes it extremely difficult to intercept.An air-launched ballistic missile, the Kh-47 has a range of some 2,000 kilometers (1,250 miles), so can be fired far from the battlefield.It travels at about 10 times the speed of sound and is derived from the shorter-range Iskander ballistic missile, which is ground launched. It carries a warhead of nearly 500 kilograms.Ukrainian intelligence believes Russia has only a few dozen Kinzhal missiles in its arsenal \u2013 a claim which couldn\u2019t be independently verified.Several Kinzhal missiles were launched at Ukrainian targets in March, but it\u2019s not clear what damage they did or whether they all reached their targets. In April, Ukraine\u2019s Defense Ministry said Patriot systems had arrived from the US, Germany and the Netherlands.If one of those systems has now destroyed a Kh-47, as the Ukrainians say, it calls into question the capabilities of one of Russia\u2019s new generation of weapons.After the Kinzhal was first tested, Putin told Russia\u2019s Federal Council in 2018: \u201cThe unique flight characteristics of the high-speed carrier aircraft allow the missile to be delivered to the point of discharge within minutes.\u201dHe also said that its hypersonic speed would allow it to \u201covercome all existing and, I think, prospective anti-aircraft and anti-missile defense systems, delivering nuclear and conventional warheads in a range of over 2,000 kilometers.\u201dRussia has made ambitious claims for several of its newer military systems, but their prowess is unproven.Though deployed in small numbers, the Russians\u2019 newest main battle tank, the T-90M, has appeared vulnerable to unsophisticated munitions, and the flagship of Russia\u2019s Black Sea fleet, the Moskva, was sunk early in the conflict.Russia's war in UkraineAnalysts have questioned the Kinzhal\u2019s capabilities during the final phase of its flight, suggesting it may not be as maneuverable or as fast as it approaches a target.The deployment of the Patriot represents a sea change in Ukraine\u2019s air defense capabilities, which have been highly reliant on Soviet-era S-300 air defenses \u2013 for which munitions now appear in short supply.The Patriots provide a modern dimension to Ukraine\u2019s air defense layers, as does the German IRIS-T system. But it\u2019s also much more complex, requiring about 100 personnel to operate.Ukrainian air force spokesman Yurii Inhat said Saturday that the Russians \u201cwere saying that the Patriot is an outdated American weapon, and Russian weapons are the best in the world.\u201d\u201cWell, there is confirmation that it effectively works against even a super hypersonic missile.\u201d Ihnat said, adding that intercepting the Kinzhal is \u201ca slap in the face for Russia.\u201d"

According to ABI Research, foldable and flexible displays made up about 0.7% of the smartphone market in 2021, and in 2022 expected to fall just shy of 2%.High price points have limited consumer adoption, too. The Pixel Fold is rumored to start at $1,700.It\u2019s not surprising Google is dipping its toes into the world of foldables but it\u2019s possible it waited to launch its own version until the technology became more advanced. Early versions of the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold, for example, had issues with the screen and most apps were not well optimized for the design.\u201cGoogle has been working on bringing better user experiences to foldable devices from a software perspective, so when coupled with improvements on the hardware side the market conditions are at a state now where it makes sense for a Pixel Fold,\u201d said Michael Inouye, an analyst at ABI Research."

Citi\u2019s got a relatively small portfolio of quality credit cards and a rewarding program to boot. In fact, its credit cards offer some of the most generous category bonuses in exchange for reasonable annual fees.When it comes to redeeming your hard-earned points, Citi has an impressive transfer partner list that makes it possible to maximize your rewards for travel bookings. And if you don\u2019t want to learn the ins and outs of various loyalty programs, Citi also gives you the option to use points for statement credits and direct travel bookings.If you\u2019re curious about how the Citi ThankYou program works, here\u2019s everything you need to know about how to get the most out of the program for travel.You can earn Citi ThankYou points in numerous ways. The easiest is through credit card sign-up bonuses, which range depending on the card. But that\u2019s not the only way to earn points in this program. Between checking account bonuses and authorized user incentives, there are many ways to earn ThankYou points beyond credit cards.The best Citi credit cardsCiti has a small but mighty credit card lineup, offering generous welcome bonuses and ongoing rewards. The issuer\u2019s credit cards are generally split into two categories: traditional ThankYou points-earning cards and. However, recently, Citi made a change to its program that now sees its, which can also be redeemed for traditional cash back.Citi has two cards that earn ThankYou points directly. These cards are ideal for maximizing rewards on everyday purchases, with theandspecifically offering significant bonuses in those everyday categories.Earn 60,000 bonus points after spending $4,000 within the first three months of account opening. Plus, for a limited time, earn a total of 10 ThankYou points per dollar spent on hotel, car rentals and attractions (excluding air travel) booked through the Citi Travel portal through June 30, 2024.Earn 25,000 bonus points after spending $1,500 within the first three months of account opening.

They can be incredibly valuable, considering theearns 2% on everything. By adding this card to your wallet, you\u2019ll earn a minimum of 2 ThankYou points per dollar spent on all purchases that aren\u2019t eligible for the bonus categories on theorcards.Considering Citi\u2019shave, adding one to your wallet could make a lot of sense. You\u2019ll enhance your point earning across the board without additional annual fees.NoneEarn $200 cash back after spending $1,500 within the first three months of account opening.Earn up to 2% cash back on all spending: 1% cash back when you buy, plus an additional 1% as you pay for those purchases.Earn 5% cash back on your highest eligible spend category each billing cycle up to $500 spent; 1% cash back thereafter.$0$0By combining the Citi cards you have in your wallet, you can maximize your earnings and ensure you continue to work your way toward your next redemption.Adding an authorized user can help you earn more Citi points in two ways: bonus points for adding someone and for all of their purchases. First, you\u2019ll sometimes get bonus points just for adding someone to your account. Citi frequently sends out authorized user bonuses to targeted card holders. These bonuses are typically around 2,500 bonus points but can vary.The best credit cards for adding authorized usersSecondly, you\u2019ll earn Citi ThankYou points based on all the spending yourputs on their card. Of course, you\u2019ll only want to consider adding a member of your household or someone you trust to pay you back as an\u00a0authorized user\u00a0on your account. Authorized users can make charges on the credit card they\u2019ve been added to but have no liability when it comes to paying the bill \u2014 that onus falls on you, the primary card holder.How to choose the best checking accountIf you\u2019d like to earn even more ThankYou points, you can do so with a checking account. That\u2019s because Citi offers severalthat earn ThankYou points as a benefit: The Citigold,, Citi Private Bank and Citibank Account. With these accounts, you can earn up to 1,600 points per month on everyday banking activities. Theyou\u2019ll earn depends on your account type and qualifying activities. Generally, Citigold,and Citi Private Bank accounts earn the most points.Sharing points is a great way to consolidate existing points with a significant other or family member. Citi ThankYou is one of the few programs that allows members to share points free of charge. The only stipulation is that you can only share points with someone who has a Citi ThankYou card, andcard holders are not eligible.It\u2019s worth noting that shared points expire 90 days after receipt. So you shouldn\u2019t transfer points unless you or the person you\u2019re sending them to has an immediate use for them. Also, note that you can\u2019t send or receive more than 100,000 points per calendar year.Once you\u2019ve earned a slew of Citi ThankYou points comes the fun part of redeeming them. And thankfully, Citi offers many different ways for you to. You\u2019ll get the most bang for your buck by redeeming points for travel, though that\u2019s certainly not the only option.Here\u2019s a look at your Citi ThankYou travel redemption options and how they work.Transferring points will get you the most value from your Citi ThankYou points. Citi has 16 airline and hotel partners, most of which you can transfer points to at a 1-to-1 ratio \u2014 however, that ratio can vary. You can redeem them for stays at,, domestic award flights and more. But keep in mind that not all airline and hotel loyalty programs are equal.Best ways to use Citi ThankYou pointsUltimately, you\u2019ll want to research which program will offer you the most in return, depending on what your travel plans are. Like with the,and, you\u2019ll need to link your accounts with each of the transfer partners, and you\u2019ll also need to search for award availability with the airline of your choice before transferring any points.If you\u2019re interested in transferring your Citi ThankYou points to a travel partner, these are your 16 options as well as the transfer rate.By transferring Citi ThankYou points to partner airlines, you unlock the ability to travel for next to nothing \u2014 in most cases when redeeming, you\u2019ll just have to pay the taxes and fees on a ticket. As a result, points and miles open up the door for flying experiences that would otherwise be out of reach.8 of the best business-class seats you can book nearly for free using points and milesKeep in mind that the most obvious airline choice may not always be your best option. Airlines typically have extensive alliance networks, allowing you to redeem points for partner airlines through their respective programs. For example,and Air France/KLM are both members of the SkyTeam alliance, meaning you can transfer your Citi ThankYou points to Flying Blue and redeem for flights operated by Delta Air Lines.Citi\u2019s airline partners will get you the most value for your points, especially if you redeem them forand. That being said, Citi\u2019s airline partners offer several sweet spot awards. These heavily discounted awards will save you points on travel and make earning ThankYou points worthwhile. Some of these sweet spots awards that will get you maximum value for your ThankYou points include the following:Generally speaking, you\u2019ll get the most value out of your Citi ThankYou points by transferring them to airline or hotel partners. But that may not always make sense for all card holders \u2014 and it\u2019s not your only option.Citi ThankYou points are worth 1 cent each when you use them to book travel through the Citi ThankYou portal. That\u2019s significantly less than the value you\u2019ll get from transfer partner redemptions. While transferring points is the best way to maximize your ThankYou points, doing so isn\u2019t always possible. If that\u2019s the case \u2014 or if you\u2019re not interested in researching award availability \u2014 redeeming at a fixed value for travel via the ThankYou portal is a decent option.Citi offers several fixed redemption options, ideal for folks who would rather leverage points for daily expenses than travel bookings. The value you can get from this option ranges from 0.5 cents to 1 cent per point. While redeeming points this way isn\u2019t advisable, as you won\u2019t get as much value out of each point, you should use them however they suit you best.For example, if you have no travel plans in the foreseeable future but mounting expenses at home, then redeeming your ThankYou points for mortgage or student loan payments might make sense. Here are some additional ways you can redeem your ThankYou points and the value you\u2019ll get per point in each scenario:Generally speaking, if you\u2019re looking to get the most value out of your Citi ThankYou points, your worst option is when redeeming for a fixed value (for example, for statement credits). However, if you\u2019re willing to sacrifice the value of your points and instead want to save some cash, it could be a solid option. Ultimately, every card holder\u2019s goals for their points will be different, but it\u2019s good that you have options with ThankYou points.Citi ThankYou points are worth about 1.7 cents each when you redeem them for travel through transfer partners, according to frequent flyer website. The exact amount varies depending on the cabin and destination you\u2019re flying to. Generally speaking, you\u2019ll get the most value by redeeming points for internationaland. While 1.7 cents per point isn\u2019t guaranteed for all redemptions, it\u2019s a number you should aim for if you want to redeem ThankYou points for maximum value.Aside from travel redemptions, you can use ThankYou points for mortgage payments, student loans or charitable contributions, and they\u2019re worth 1 cent apiece. At 0.5 cents each when redeemed for statement credits or check by mail, you\u2019ll get the lowest value when redeeming Citi points.Citi ThankYou points are an incredibly valuable currency and can help you meet your most aspirational travel goals. Whether you\u2019re using points for domestic or international travel, Citi\u2019s wide selection of transfer partners offers terrific redemption value. Between a good credit card selection, top-notch travel partners and flexibility in use, Citi ThankYou points are definitely worth adding to your points portfolio."

Think housing, health insurance, car payments, cell phones, credit cards, subscription services, student loans and travel.And, as it turns out, kids and parents don\u2019t agree on just when exactly that time should be.A new survey from Bankrate found that Gen Z adults (between the ages of 18 and 26) think parents should slow their roll on when to stop paying for them.Take housing. Gen Z adults said they shouldn\u2019t have to start paying rent until age 23 on average. Baby Boomer and Gen X parents beg to differ, saying their kids should pony up starting at age 21. When it comes to cell phones and credit card bills, Gen Z thinks they should start paying for them by age 21. Their parents say age 19 would be better.The Bankrate survey doesn\u2019t specify how many respondents are living with their parents or, conversely, their adult children. But it\u2019s a fair bet the percentage could be significant. In July 2022, the Pew Research Center found that half of adults ages 18 to 29 were living with at least one parent.Of course, how a parent feels about the need for their child to pay their own bills and what a parent does may be two very different things.Nearly 7 in 10 parents with children 18 or older said they have made a financial sacrifice to help their grown-up kids, according to the survey. Thirty-one percent characterized that sacrifice as \u201csignificant,\u201d while 37% said it was \u201csomewhat significant.\u201dSacrifice meant: Reducing their emergency savings (51%), impairing their ability to pay off their own debt (49%) or save for retirement (43%); and making it hard to reach some other financial milestone (55%).Low-income parents \u2014 defined as those making $50,000 or less a year \u2014 were most likely to say they have made financial sacrifices to help their adult children.For instance, 58% of the lowest earners said they sacrificed their emergency savings compared to 46% of the highest earning households \u2014 defined as earning $100,000 or more a year.While it can be hard to say no to your adult offspring if they ask for, or simply expect, a financial assist, parents do themselves no favors if they subsidize them at the expense of their own financial security.After all, not everyone is likely to backstop a parent who falls behind on housing payments, fails to create a sufficient financial cushion for retirement or who finds they can\u2019t afford medical care.\u201cMake sure the assistance [you give] works within your budget and be clear about the parameters,\u201d said Ted Rossman, a senior analyst at Bankrate. \u201cHelping out shouldn\u2019t be seen as a blank check or an indefinite handout. It might help to attach a specific dollar amount or time frame.\u201d"

        "text": "Employers who want a productive, engaged workforce could do more to train, develop and support those in their managerial ranks. That\u2019s because managers are the secret sauce.Gallup\u2019s Quarterly Workforce Indicator surveys consistently show that managers are a linchpin to employee engagement, retention, productivity and trust in leadership.Are you really cut out to be a manager?As it turns out, effective training for managers is not a thing at many workplaces. \u201cI would say 99% of employers don\u2019t provide effective training \u2014 and I\u2019m not exaggerating there,\u201d said Ashley Herd, a former human resources executive who founded @ManagerMethod. \u201cWhile some provide training, rarely is it effective [in providing] the guidance needed to help managers understand how to meet business goals while supporting employees in the right way,\u201d she said.One key thing managers need to know is how to communicate well. In fact, how managers speak with employees \u2014 and how often \u2014 can go a long way to building employees\u2019 trust and commitment, according to Gallup.Managers who already feel stretched thin may not be psyched to hear this, but one of Gallup\u2019s surveys \u2014 which included responses from more than 67,000 US workers \u2014 found that the most effective way to make someone feel connected to an organization is to have a \u201cmeaningful\u201d conversationweek withdirect report to discuss goals, customers and well-being as well as offer recognition. The recommended time to allot for each conversation: 15 to 30 minutes.Sounds like a lot. But if you have, say, a team of 10 people, you\u2019re talking about walling off no more than 2.5 hours a week.\u201cWe find this single habit develops high-performance relationships more than any other single leadership activity,\u201d Gallup researchers noted.The workplace research firm\u2019s surveys have found that the ratio of engaged to actively disengaged US workers is 1.8-to-1 today, down from a record high of 2.7-to-1 in 2019.The purpose of regular check-ins, researchers noted, is to have \u201cstrengths-based conversations that bring clarity and purpose to work \u2014 which is now deteriorating in US organizations.\u201dHelping employees to feel connected is especially critical in a, which done right can itself also boost employee engagement, Gallup found.In a separate study, Gallup has found that employees feeling free to speak truthfully about the effects of big changes at work is one key way to build trust in leaders.\u201cWhen employees strongly agree that they have had opportunities to provide honest feedback about organizational changes, they are 7.4 times as likely to have confidence in their leaders to successfully manage emerging challenges,\u201d Gallup research noted.Herd offered a few recommendations for what employers can do to improve their development of managers. For starters, she said:The latest on hybrid work: Who is WFH and who isn'tFind out what training they are receiving, what training they would like to see and what they do that works well for their teams.Find out what support they are getting from their managers, and what they would like to see.Name an internal learning and development contact or someone from HR to gather information on best practices from those surveys. Have that person then lead an internal training for managers and another one for employees about how to work with their managers. Ask a handful of participants in each to talk about the best practices they\u2019ve used \u2014 and have different leaders talk about their styles (e.g., extrovert or introvert), how they found their voice and how they work with different personalities on their teams.One might be for managers to regularly meet with direct reports and not cancel on them except in a true emergency or when the manager is on PTO.That way the manager and employee can add items if they wish.\u201c[Remind them to] ask questions of employees, rather than just talk themselves,\u201d Herd said."

Wives in these marriages spend roughly 2 hours more per week on caregiving than husbands do and about 2.5 hours more on housework,\u201d the study notes.In 55% of opposite-sex marriages, men are the primary or sole breadwinners, earning a median of $96,000 to their wives\u2019 $30,000.The US gender pay gap: Why it hasn't narrowed much in 20 yearsMeanwhile, in 16% of marriages the wives outearn their husbands as the primary (10%) or sole breadwinner (6%). In these marriages women earn a median of $88,000 to their husbands\u2019 $35,000.Of all of these categories, the only one in which men are reported to spend more time caregiving than their wives is when the woman is the sole breadwinner. And the time spent per week on household chores in those marriages is split evenly between husbands and wives.In all instances, it\u2019s a big change from 50 years ago \u2014 when, for instance, husbands were the primary breadwinner in 85% of marriages.Today, which women are most likely to be the primary or sole breadwinners can vary by age, family status, education and race.For instance, Pew found Black women are \u201csignificantly more likely\u201d than other women to earn more than their husbands. For instance, 26% of Black women bring home more than their husbands, while only 17% of White women and 13% of Hispanic women do.But Black women with a college degree or higher and few children at home are also among the most likely to earn about the same as their husbands.These numbers are reported against a backdrop of society\u2019s attitudes about who should earn more and how caregiving should be divvied up between spouses.Nearly half of Americans (48%) in Pew\u2019s survey said husbands prefer to earn more than their wives, while 13% said men would prefer their wives earn about the same as them.What do women want? Twenty-two percent of Americans said most women want a husband who earns more, while 26% said most would want a man who earns about the same.Meanwhile, when it comes to having a family, 77% said that children are better off when both parents focus equally on their job and on taking care of the kids. Only 19% said children are better off when their mother focuses more on home life and their father focuses more on his job.The Pew study is based on three data sources: earnings data from the US Census\u2019 Current Population Survey; data from the American Time Use Survey and a nationally representative survey of public attitudes among 5,152 US adults conducted in January."

        "text": "Just as stock market turmoil is a good reminder to make sure your investment portfolio is diversified, a few surprise bank failures is a good excuse to find out whether your financial accounts \u2014 not just your checking and savings accounts \u2014 are all protected in the event that an institution housing them fails.Spoiler alert: You likely have at least some protection in all but your crypto accounts.Here is a quick rundown on what protections exist for your accounts in a bank, credit union, brokerage, 401(k) plan, IRA and cryptocurrency exchange.Make sure the banks you use are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.Should your FDIC-insured bank fail, that coverage will protect up to $250,000 per depositor for each account ownership category at that bank.There are several types of deposit accounts you may have at one bank (e.g., individual savings account, joint checking, business account, etc.) and each would be covered separately. For example, if you own an account jointly, each owner is covered up to $250,000, so effectively you and your spouse will have $500,000 in coverage for that one account.That would be in addition to coverage you would receive for any account in your name only. (Use thisto figure out your coverage, given the particulars of your situation.)The FDIC also offers coverage for your certificates of deposit accounts and deposits such as cash or a CD made in connection withthatare self-directed \u2014 meaning you decide how the money is invested. This may include some 401(k) plans,and IRAs. For example, say you have two IRA accounts at your bank and both are invested CDs. If, combined, they are worth $300,000, you would be covered for $250,000 in total if your bank failed.FDIC insuranceor valuables \u2014 in your account, which means stocks, bonds, crypto or the contents of your safe deposit box are not insured. \u201cInvestment products that are not deposits, such as mutual funds, annuities, life insurance policies and stocks and bonds, are not covered by FDIC deposit insurance,\u201d the agency notes.If you have money at a credit union, you should make sure that the entity is federally insured through the National Credit Union Administration., which is backed by the full faith and credit of the US government,up to $250,000, in much the same way the FDICcovers bank accounts. And, as with FDIC coverage at banks, your credit union money may be insured for more than $250,000 if it is spread across different types of accounts that are eligible for coverage.If you have an account of stocks and bonds with aof the nonprofit, you will receive up to $500,000 of protection, should that brokerage fail and a portion of your assets are still not recovered when the firm liquidates.SIPC protection will cover anything defined asunder the Securities Investor Protection Act, such as stocks, bonds, CDs, mutual funds and money market funds.Up to $250,000 of your $500,000 coverage can be used to protect cash in your account associated with your securities \u2014 for example, if you just sold some stocks and put the proceeds in your account.For answers to more specific SIPC questions, this is a very.On top of SIPC insurance, a brokerage may provide additional protection to its customers through private insurers.If you invest in crypto assets you have no federally guaranteed protections should the company acting as custodian of your assets go under.Even if you\u2019re holding your crypto assets at a firm that is an SEC-registered broker-dealer and it is a member of SIPC, your crypto assets will not receive SIPC protection. The reason? \u201cCrypto would have to be deemed a \u2018security\u2019 under the Securities Investor Protection Act. Crypto is not a security under SIPA,\u201d said SIPC president and CEO Josephine Wang.The Securities and Exchange Commission also spelled out in a recent investor alert thefor crypto investors.The legal and regulatory environment \u2014 not to mention best practices for crypto businesses  \u2014 remain in flux.Generally speaking, \u201cyour protection lies solely in the contract with the exchange,\u201d said law professor Pamela Foohey of Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law. \u201cAnd [those contracts] can be updated without notice.\u201dWhat\u2019s more, there isn\u2019t enough legal precedent to know how a bankruptcy court judge will interpret those contracts and your claim to the assets in question.A judge may decide, for instance, that assets from your crypto account belong to the company (aka debtor), not you, and that you are an unsecured creditor, meaning you will be last in line to be paid back if the failed company has any money to pay out. That is essentiallyin an initial ruling in the bankruptcy case of.And even if a court does decide the assets belong to you, not the company, the legal process to get your assets back could take years, Foohey noted.If your, legally the vested money in your 401(k) cannot be treated as the company\u2019s assets by a bankruptcy court. So the company\u2019s creditors may not make a claim on them.\u201c[The] protects 401(k) assets that have been deposited and are fully vested if the employer files bankruptcy,\u201d said Hattie Greenan, spokesperson for the Plan Sponsor Council of America.If, however, your employer failed in its duty to deposit any of your contributions or any of the company matches by the time of bankruptcy, that money may be lost to you.If your employer had in place a defined-benefit pension plan and you are entitled to benefits, they are likely to be paid to you up to a cap by the, which insures employer pensions."

But if you carry a balance, and especially if you only pay the minimum amount due, you will be shelling out more dollars every month just for interest, and it will take you longer to pay off what you owe.Expect to see your interest rate go up within a few statements.Your best bet is to try to find a good balance-transfer card with an initial 0% rate and make a plan to pay off what you owe in the coming months before a high rate kicks in.\u201cTurbocharge your debt repayment efforts with a 0% balance transfer offer, some lasting as long as 21 months,\u201d said McBride. \u201cThis insulates you from further rate hikes and gives you a runway to get the debt paid off once and for all.\u201dBut first find out what, if any, fees you will have to pay (such as a balance-transfer fee or annual fee), and what the penalties will be for late or missed payments during the zero-rate period.The best strategy is always to pay off as much of your existing balance as possible \u2014 on time every month \u2014 before the zero-rate period ends. Otherwise, any remaining balance will be subject to a new interest rate that could be higher than you had before, if rates continue to rise.If you can\u2019t get a zero-rate balance card, your second best option might be a relatively low fixed-rate personal loan.The average personal loan rate was 10.82% as of April 26, according to Bankrate. But the best rate you can get will depend on your income, credit score and debt-to-income ratio. Right now, the current range of rates on offer runs from 6% to 36%.Bankrate\u2019s advice: To get the best deal, ask a few lenders for quotes before filling out a loan application."

        "text": "Given the choice between getting a 5% return on your money versus less than half a percent, which would you prefer?The average bank savings rate as of April 26 was a paltry 0.24%, according to Bankrate. At some of the biggest banks, savings rates are as low as 0.01%.But thanks to thesince mid-March of last year and competition for your money, you have many more lucrative options.Here are a few low-risk ways to make between 4% and 5% on your savings now.\u201cWe\u2019re talking to all our clients about this,\u201d said certified financial planner Natalie Colley, lead adviser at Francis Financial.You\u2019ll always want to keep enough money in your checking account at a bank that is insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (or at a similarly insured credit union) to pay your monthly bills and to perhaps cover a month of living expenses for emergencies.For the rest of your emergency fund and other savings, you can get a healthy return just by opening an online high-yield savings account at an FDIC insured online bank. Some are now paying between 4.35% and 4.8%.The Fed lifts rates by a quarter pointSome other entities are also offering FDIC-insured high-yield options, although there is a catch: To take advantage of them, you already have to be a customer of the company or a user of its products. The financial roboadvisor firm Betterment, for example, is offering 4.35% APY, while Apple is offering its users a 4.15% return.As with most bank rates, high-yield rates are variable so can change at any point. But since online banks are competing for deposits, they are likely to keep their rates higher than others.When you purchase an FDIC-insured bank certificate of deposit you agree to lock up your money for a period of time \u2014 anywhere from 1 month to 5 years. In exchange you get a guaranteed rate of return, which will be listed as the APY (Annual Percentage Yield).Some of the highest-paying CDs have 5% APYs and mature in anywhere from three months to two years.If you invest $10,000 in a six-month CD with a 5% APY, you\u2019ll get your principal back plus nearly $247 in interest when the CD matures, according to Bankrate\u2019s CD calculator. A one-year CD will earn $500 in interest, while an 18-month term will generate $759.There are two ways to buy a CD. You can buy one directly from an FDIC-insured bank. But before you do, check what early withdrawal penalties there are in case you need to access your money before the CD matures, said certified financial planner Nick Holeman, Betterment\u2019s director of financial planning.Or instead, you can buy \u201cbrokered\u201d CDs through online brokerage platforms like eTrade, Schwab or Fidelity. They offer one-stop shopping to compare and contrast a broad universe of bank CDs at all maturity ranges.Buying brokered CDs also means you don\u2019t have to set up new, individual accounts at different banks, but the CDs will still be FDIC-insured, assuming the banks sponsoring them are.And if you need access to your money early, you can sell it on the secondary market through the brokerage, although as with selling any investment there is no guarantee you will get back what you paid for it.Since CD rates tend to move in advance of the Federal Reserve\u2019s anticipated rate moves \u2014 and the expectation is that it may refrain from further hikes \u2014 5% yields may head south soon.\u201cThis could be the \u2018last call\u2019 for savers,\u201d said Greg McBride, Bankrate\u2019s chief financial analyst.\u201cYields on CD maturities longer than one year will start to slip shortly after it becomes clear the Fed is done raising rates and not just pausing,\u201d McBride noted. \u201cNow is the time to lock in those CDs as the 4% and higher yields will likely disappear in the second half of the year.\u201dShorter term CD maturities (i.e., under a year) will likely have a little more staying power, he said. But, he noted, \u201cif the economy weakens noticeably, inflation drops meaningfully, or the Fed shifts stance and starts talking about cutting rates, this will be the catalyst for those yields to begin moving lower. Finding 4% yields will still be possible but the 5% yields will likely disappear by fall.\u201dIf you\u2019re working with a financial planner or broker or are consulting with a fixed income specialist at your online brokerage, another investment option are Treasury bills, which mature in under a year.Of late, for instance, the 3-month and 6-month T-bills have annualized yields of around 5%. And unlike interest on CDs, which is fully taxable at the federal, state and local levels, earnings on a T-bill are usually exempt from state and local tax.So even if the yield on a CD may be a bit higher, on an after-tax basis the T-bill might net you more. \u201cDon\u2019t just look at the interest rate,\u201d Holeman said.But again, T bills are not as straightforward as high-yield savings accounts or CDs. So working with a professional on this may be your best bet.As attractive as many savings rates are today, they are no substitute for the long-term returns you can earn in a diversified investment portfolio of stocks, bonds and other assets.Colley\u2019s advice: Find one or two high-yield instruments for your current savings to lock in today\u2019s attractive rates. \u201cKeep it simple,\u201d she said. \u201c[But] don\u2019t take money out of your portfolio to chase yield.\u201d"

A year ago, the 30-year fixed-rate was 5.10%.Mortgages aren\u2019t tied directly to Fed rate decisions, but rather to movements in the, the benchmark rate for many consumer loans.As to where mortgage rates go next, look to inflation. If inflation keeps dropping, then mortgage rates are expected to drift lower too. But don\u2019t expect them to go back to 3%.The Fed lifts rates by a quarter pointMeanwhile, the variable rate on a home equity line of credit or a fixed rate on a home equity loan will rise because their formulas are directly tied to the Fed\u2019s rates.The average home equity loan rate was running at 7.94% as of April 26, well above the 6.4% recorded in mid-April last year.The average HELOC rate, meanwhile, hit 8%, about double where it was in mid-April last year, according to Bankrate.Whether rates on mortgages, home equity lines of credit and HELOCs rise or fall from here, securing a home loan may become tougher since banks, wanting to bolster their defenses against potential adverse events like a run on deposits, may want to take fewer risks and preserve more cash. One way to do that: make borrowing requirements more stringent.If you are close to buying a home or refinancing one, it may be a good idea to lock in the lowest fixed rate available to you.That said, \u201crushing into the purchase of a big-ticket item like a house or car that doesn\u2019t fit in your budget is a recipe for trouble, regardless of what interest rates do in the future,\u201d said Texas-based certified financial planner Lacy Rogers.If you are already a homeowner with a variable-rate home equity line of credit, and you used part of it for a home improvement project, you should ask your lender if it\u2019s possible to fix the rate on your outstanding balance, effectively creating a fixed-rate home equity loan, suggested Greg McBride, Bankrate\u2019s chief financial analyst.If that\u2019s not possible, consider paying off that balance by taking out a HELOC with another lender, at a lower promotional rate, McBride said."

In some cases, people who baited the new Bing were subject to.\u201cWe\u2019re getting better at speed, we\u2019re getting better at accuracy \u2026 but we are on a never-ending quest to make things better and better,\u201d Yusuf Mehdi,a VP at Microsoft overseeing its AI initiatives, told CNN on Wednesday.Bing now gets more than 100 million daily active users each day, a significant uptick in the past few months, according to Mehdi. Google, which has long dominated the market, is also adding similar AI features to its search engine.In February, Microsofthow its revamped search engine could write summaries of search results, chat with users to answer additional questions about a query and write emails or other compositions based on the results.At a press event in New York City on Wednesday, the company shared an early look at some updates, including the ability to ask questions with pictures, access chat history so the chatbot remembers its rapport with users, and export responses to Microsoft Word. Users can also personalize the tone and style of the chatbot\u2019s responses, selecting from a lengthier, creative reply to something that\u2019s shorterand to the point.Snapchat's new AI chatbot is already raising alarms among teens and parentsThe wave of attention in recent monthsaround ChatGPT, developed by OpenAI with financial backing fromMicrosoft, helped renew an arms race among tech companies to deploy similar AI tools in their products. OpenAI, Microsoft and Google are at the forefront of this trend, but IBM, Amazon, Baidu and Tencent are working on similar technologies. A long list of startups are also developing AI writing assistants and image generators.Beyond adding AI features to search, Microsoft has said it plans to bring ChatGPT technology to its core productivity tools, including Word, Excel and Outlook, with the potential to change the way we work. The decision to add generative AI features to Bing could be particularly risky, however, given how much people rely on search engines for accurate and reliable information.Microsoft\u2019s moves also come amid heightened scrutiny on the rapid pace of advancement in AI technology.In March, some of the biggest names in tech, including Elon Musk and Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak, called for artificial intelligence labs to stop the training of the most powerful AI systems for at least six months, citing \u201cprofound risks to society and humanity.\u201dMehdi said he doesn\u2019t believe the AI industry is moving too fast and suggested the calls for a pause aren\u2019t particularly helpful.\u201cSome people think we should pause development for six months but I\u2019m not sure that fixes anything or improves or moves things along,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I understand where it\u2019s coming from concern wise.\u201dHe added: \u201cThe only way to really build this technology well is to do it out in the open in the public so we can have conversations about it.\u201d"

She worries abouthowpresents itself to young users like her daughter on Snapchat.The feature is powered by the viral AI chatbot tool ChatGPT \u2013 and like ChatGPT, it can offer recommendations, answer questions and converse with users. But Snapchat\u2019s version has some key differences: Users can customize the chatbot\u2019sname, design a custom Bitmoji avatar for it, and bring it into conversations with friends.The net effect is that conversing with Snapchat\u2019s chatbot may feel less transactional than visiting ChatGPT\u2019s website. It also may be less clear you\u2019re talking to a computer.\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019m prepared to know how to teach my kid how to emotionally separate humans and machines when they essentially look the same from her point of view,\u201d Lee said. \u201cI just think there is a really clear line [Snapchat] is crossing.\u201dThe new tool is facing backlash not only from parents but also from some Snapchatusers who are bombarding the app with bad reviews in the app store and criticisms on social media over privacy concerns, \u201ccreepy\u201d exchanges and an inability to remove the feature from their chat feed unless they pay for a premium subscription.While some may find value in the tool, the mixed reactions hint at the risks companies face in rolling out new generative AI technology to their products, and particularly in products like Snapchat, whose users skew younger.Snapchat was an early launch partner when OpenAIto ChatGPT to third-party businesses, with many more expected to follow. Almost overnight, Snapchat has forced some families and lawmakers to reckon with questions that may have seemed theoretical only months ago.In ato the CEOs of Snap and other tech companies last month, weeks after My AI was released to Snap\u2019s subscription customers, Democratic Sen. Michael Bennet raised concerns about the interactions the chatbot was having with younger users. In particular, he cited reports that it can provide kids with suggestions for how to lie to their parents.\u201cThese examples would be disturbing for any social media platform, but they are especially troubling for Snapchat, which almost 60 percent of American teenagers use,\u201d Bennet wrote. \u201cAlthough Snap concedes My AI is \u2018experimental,\u2019 it has nevertheless rushed to enroll American kids and adolescents in its social experiment.\u201dIn a blog post last week, the company said: \u201cMy AI is far from perfect but we\u2019ve made a lot of progress.\u201dIn the days since its formal launch, Snapchat users have been vocal about their concerns. One user called his interaction \u201cterrifying\u201d after he said it lied about not knowing where the user was located. After the user lightened the conversation, he said the chatbot accurately revealed he lived in Colorado.In another TikTok video with more than 1.5 million views, a user named Ariel recorded a song with an intro, chorus and piano chords written by My AI about what it\u2019s like to be a chatbot. When she sent the recorded song back, she said the chatbot denied its involvement with the reply: \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but as an AI language model, I don\u2019t write songs.\u201d Ariel called the exchange \u201ccreepy.\u201dOther users shared concerns about how the tool understands, interacts with and collects information from photos. \u201cI snapped a picture \u2026 and it said \u2018nice shoes\u2019 and asked who the people [were] in the photo,\u201d a Snapchat user wrote on Facebook.Snapchat told CNN it continues to improve My AI based on community feedback and is working to establish more guardrails to keep its users safe. The company also said that similar to its other tools, users don\u2019t have to interact with My AI if they don\u2019t want to.It\u2019s not possibleto remove My AI from chat feeds, however, unless a user subscribes to itsmonthly premium service, Snapchat+. Some teens say they have opted to pay the $3.99 Snapchat+ fee to turn off the tool before promptly canceling the service.But not all users dislike the feature.One user wrote on Facebook that she\u2019s been asking My AI for homework help. \u201cIt gets all of the questions right.\u201d Another noted she\u2019s leaned on it for comfort and advice. \u201cI love my little pocket, bestie!\u201d she wrote. \u201cYou can change the Bitmoji [avatar] for it and surprisingly it offers really great advice to some real life situations. \u2026 I love the support it gives.\u201dChatGPT, which is trained on vast troves of data online, has previously comefor spreading inaccurate information, responding to users in ways they might find inappropriate and enabling students to cheat. But Snapchat\u2019s integration of the tool risks heightening some of these issues, and adding new ones.Alexandra Hamlet, a clinical psychologist in New York City, said the parents of some of her patients have expressed concern about how their teenager could interact with Snapchat\u2019s tool.There\u2019s also concern around chatbots giving advice and aboutmental health because AI tools can reinforce someone\u2019s confirmation bias, making it easier for users to seek out interactions that confirm their unhelpful beliefs.\u201cIf a teen is in a negative mood and does not have the awareness desire to feel better, they may seek out a conversation with a chatbot that they know will make them feel worse,\u201d she said. \u201cOver time, having interactions like these can erode a teens\u2019 sense of worth, despite their knowing that they are really talking to a bot. In an emotional state of mind, it becomes less possible for an individual to consider this type of logic.\u201dFor now, the onus is on parents to start meaningful conversations with their teens about best practices for communicating with AI, especially as the tools start to show up in more popular apps and services.Sinead Bovell, the founder of WAYE, a startup that helps prepare youth for future with advanced technologies, said parents need to make it very clear \u201cchatbots are not your friend.\u201d\u201cThey\u2019re also not your therapists or a trusted adviser, and anyone interacting with them needs to be very cautious, especially teenagers who may be more susceptible to believing what they say,\u201d she said.\u201cParents should be talking to their kids now about how they shouldn\u2019t share anything personal with a chatbot that they would a friend \u2013 even though from a user design perspective, the chatbot exists in the same corner of Snapchat.\u201dShe added that federal regulation that would require companies to abide by specific protocols is also needed to keep up the rapid pace of AI advancement."

        "text": "Facebook\u2019s parent company Meta announced Wednesday that it has taken down a network of more than 100 China-based accounts that posed as organizations in the US and Europe and pushed pro-Beijing talking points.The Facebook and Instagram accounts, which included a fictitious news organization and posed as a think tank, likely used deepfake images developed through artificial intelligence to make the fake accounts appear legitimate, Meta said.The network, which had more than 15,000 followers on Meta\u2019s platforms, appears to have had some financial resources behind it. In one instance, the people behind the accounts called for protests in Budapest against George Soros, the billionaire philanthropist and frequent target of right-wing groups, and posted on Twitter an offer to pay people to attend. The accounts also offered to pay freelance writers to contribute to at least one of its websites.The accounts were awash with pro-China commentary, including \u201cwarnings against boycotting the 2022 Beijing Olympics; allegations of US foreign policy in Africa,\u201d and \u201cclaims of comfortable living conditions for Uyghurs in China,\u201d Meta said in its report. The fake accounts also posted \u201cnegative commentary about Uyghur activists and critics of the Chinese state,\u201d it said.Russia and China are promoting US voting misinformation ahead of midterms, FBI warnsMeta did not link the network to the Chinese government, instead saying it found links to individuals in China associated with a technology company. CNN has reached out to the company for comment. Meta regularly takes down covert influence campaigns and discloses information about them in quarterly reports.The takedowns \u201csignal a shift in the nature\u201d of China-based influence networks, as Chinese operatives embrace new tactics like setting up a front company, hiring freelance writers around the world and offering to recruit protesters, Ben Nimmo, Meta\u2019s global threat intelligence lead, told reporters on Tuesday.While the networks are generally small and have struggled to build an audience, \u201cthey are experimenting with diverse tactics and that\u2019s always something we want to keep an eye on,\u201d Nimmo said.The tactics are similar to those used by Russian operatives during the 2016 US presidential election campaign. Using fake personas and posing as representatives of US political and activist organizations, Russians successfully recruited unwitting Americans to take part in political stunts.Chinese operatives have in recent years \u201cevolved their posture\u201d from being concerned about being caught influencing US elections to seeing influence operations as another tool to project power, a US official told CNN.\u201cWe\u2019re keeping a close eye\u201d on the Chinese influence operations heading into the 2024 election, the official said.Indictments from special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s team in 2018how disinformation from Russia were designed to exacerbate existing divisions in the United States.Ahead of the 2022 US midterm election, FBI officials expressed concern that Chinese operatives appeared to be engaging in \u201cRussian-style influence activities\u201d that stoke American divisions. Russian and Chinese government-affiliated operatives and organizations both promoted misinformation about the integrity of American elections that originated in the US during the midterm election season, FBI officials\u202fhave said."

        "text": "US regional bank stocks veered wildly on Thursday and Friday, accentuating fears that federal regulators have not yet contained a crisis in the sector that could shake the financial system.What\u2019s happening: PacWestshares lost half their value on Thursday after the California-based lender said it was. Shares of Arizona\u2019s Western Alliance finished down 39% despite the company\u2019sof a Financial Times report it was considering a sale. Utah\u2019s Zions and Texas\u2019 Comerica both suffered stock declines topping 12%.Regional bank shares rallied on Friday but were still down sharply compared to one week ago.What\u2019s particularly alarming, according to industry insiders? These banks weren\u2019t seeing depositors rush for the exits when investors panicked.\u201cThe bank has not experienced out-of-the-ordinary deposit flows following the sale of First Republic Bank and other news,\u201d PacWest said in a statement, noting that 75% of its deposits were insured as of May 2.Breaking it down: Wall Street is on the hunt for any signs of vulnerability in the banking system after the high-profile demise of Silicon Valley Bank, Signature Bank and First Republic Bank in a matter of weeks. While authorities stepped in to protect depositors at those banks, investors were left with stocks that were suddenly worthless. Now, they\u2019re anxious to get ahead of the next shoe to drop.But skittishness can become a self-fulfilling prophecy. Customers may see a drop in their bank\u2019s share price, assume it\u2019s in trouble, and yank their funds. Banks fail when too many people try to withdraw their deposits at once.\u201cUnfortunately, there\u2019s a feedback loop here,\u201d said Tom Michaud, the CEO of Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, an investment bank owned by Stifel that specializes in financial services.That means this bout of instability may require a circuit breaker.\u201cI believe it really only ends after we get some type of government intervention,\u201d Michaud told me. Without one, he continued, \u201cthe market will keep testing weak links \u2014 or perceived weak links.\u201dMichaud is advocating for the US Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation \u2014 which guarantees deposits up to $250,000 per person, per bank \u2014 to protect all deposits in the United States for one year.That time-limited measure would help financial markets calm down and provide space for Congress to, ensuring it\u2019s set up for the age of social media, rapid bank transfers and a growing pile of uninsured deposits, all of which can fuel or exacerbate bank runs, he said.\u201cThe simplest way to do it is [to] insure everybody for a year until we can figure it out,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need a time-out.\u201dMeanwhile, Stephen Biggar, director of financial institutions at Argus Research, is concerned that swings in regional bank stocks may be intensified by short-selling, a practice in which an investor bets against a stock and benefits when its price falls.The value of short positions in regional bank stocks reached $15.1 billion in mid-April, up from about $13.7 billion one year ago, according to data from S3 Partners. Its analysts have tracked $569 million in new short-selling over the past 30 days.\u201cIf there\u2019s a discovery there\u2019s an enormous amount of short-selling going on, I think \u2014 for the fabric of the banking system itself \u2014 that should not be allowed to stand,\u201d Biggar said, noting short-selling restrictions were imposed in March 2020 during the thick of the panic surrounding the Covid-19 pandemic.He also said the Biden administration \u2014 which has ramped up antitrust enforcement generally, raising questions about whether mergers will be approved \u2014 should signal that it supports more consolidation among small and medium-sized players in the sector. That would ensure depositors don\u2019t see the handful of big US banks, such as JPMorgan Chaseand Citigroup, as the only safe place to park their cash.Given there are still more than 4,000 banks in the United States, consolidation would make the system \u201cstronger, not weaker,\u201d Biggar said.How quickly is the pace of hiring in the United States cooling off?That question will dominate the release of the closely-watched US jobs report for April, arriving Friday morning.The latest on markets and the April jobs reportThe forecast: Economists expect to learn that the US economy added 180,000 jobs last month, according to estimates from Refinitiv.Excluding the losses during the first year of the pandemic, that would be the smallest monthly gain since December 2019.Moderate job gains would bolster other data indicating the US labor market is losing steam. Earlier this week, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said that in March, job openings declined, hiring was flat, layoffs spiked and the number of people quitting trended down.Remember: Economists have been waiting for signs the US job market is moderating after 10 consecutive rate hikes from the Federal Reserve.Fed officials want to see more slack in the labor market since it gives workers less bandwidth to ask for raises, which can prop up inflation. Slower hiring would bolster the case for the Fed to pause rate hikes.Yet assessing the magnitude of decline from here is difficult, according to Nick Bunker, economic research director at the Indeed Hiring Lab.\u201cSomething that starts as a cooldown can turn into a downturn pretty quickly,\u201d he warned.Apple\u2019s revenue has declined two quarters in a row. That\u2019s not good news for America\u2019s most valuable public company.But the tech giant\u2019s earnings, published Thursday, also include signs it could weather the economic slowdown better than feared.CEO Tim Cook announced that iPhone sales hit a record for the quarter ending in March \u201cdespite the challenging macroeconomic environment\u201d that\u2019s hurt demand for smartphones.Sales from its services business, which includes Apple Music and Apple TV+ subscriptions, also hit an all-time high. Shares are up 2% in premarket trading Friday.On the radar: Fears of a US recession loom. But Apple\u2019s future may not hinge on sales in its home country.Cook said iPhone sales had been bolstered by \u201cemerging markets from South Asia and India to Latin America and the Middle East.\u201d Last month, he traveled to India for the opening of the country\u2019s first two Apple stores in Mumbai and Delhi."

        "text": "HSBC has seen off an attempt byits biggest shareholder to break up the bank, with an \u201coverwhelming majority\u201d of investors voting Friday to keep the business intact.Shareholders of Europe\u2019s biggest bank gathered at its annual general meeting in the English city of Birmingham Friday. One particularly controversial proposal up for a votesupported by China\u2019s Ping An Asset Managementwould have forced the lender to come up with a plan to spin off or reorganize its business in Asia, which generates most of its profits.\u201cThe overwhelming majority of shareholders, excluding Ping An, have voted to draw a line under the debate on the structure of the bank,\u201d a HSBC spokesperson said in a statement.Around half of shareholders voted at the AGM, consistent with turnout in previous years, the spokesperson noted. Ping AnAsset Management, an arm of Chinese insurer Ping An, has an 8% stake in HSBC, according to the lender\u2019s latest annual report.The London-based bankis one of the world\u2019s top financial institutions, but Ping An has expressed deep concerns about the bank\u2019sfuture and has called for its Asia business to beinto a Hong Kong-listed entity.Retail investors in Hong Kong, HSBC\u2019s top market, have also been calling for a breakup, arguing that the bank\u2019s performance has been strong in Asia but weak elsewhere, dragging down overall value.HSBC's top execs face tense shareholders calling for a breakup\u201cIt\u2019s never been a discussion that management had to refute as much as they are doing right now,\u201d Fahed Kunwar, an analyst at Redburn who\u2019s been covering HSBC for almost 15 years, said prior to the meeting.HSBC\u2019s leadership unanimously opposed the resolution and had personally urged shareholders to vote against it. The executives have said that such a revamp would not work, because much of the bank\u2019s business relies on cross-border transactions.Analysts told CNN they didn\u2019t expect the proposal, which required a high threshold of 75% of yes votes to pass, to go through Friday.HSBC shares were up 2.5% in late afternoon trade in Europe on Friday.HSBC has said the board had previously reviewed options for restructuring the bank and concluded that such alternatives would \u201cmaterially destroy value.\u201dIn recent weeks, shareholder advisory firms Glass Lewis and Institutional Shareholder Services had also recommended that investors veto the proposal, citing a lack of detailed rationale and potential complications of separatingthe bank\u2019s businesses.HSBC says profits triple as it announces share buybackAlso speaking before the vote,Michael Makdad, senior equity analyst at Morningstar, said a split couldn\u2019t betaken lightly, as it could create tax headaches and a mountain of regulatory issues.HSBC\u2019s strong earnings this week, which included a, restoration of dividends and an announcement of buybacks, also gavemanagement ammunition for its argument that it\u2019s on the right path, according to analysts.Ken Lui, an activist shareholder in Hong Kong spearheading the resolution, had told CNN hewas confident his proposal would pass.HSBC is a mainstay of many portfolios in the city, including those of retirees, schoolteachers and taxi drivers.These shareholders were unhappy that the bankin 2020, at the request of British regulators. They had argued that if the lender cordoned off its activities in Asia, it would no longer have to expose the region\u2019s investors to requests in other jurisdictions.Ping An Asset Managementhadfor HSBC to overhaul its structure a year ago.It came out publicly in alast month, accusing the lender\u2019s management of exaggerating \u201cmany of the costs and risks\u201d of a breakup.But ultimately, on Friday, it failed to win the backing of any of the bank\u2019s top 50 shareholders for its position, the HSBC spokesperson said.HSBC\u2019s executives speaking at the AGM were interrupted numerous times by climate protesters inside the venue. The bank ranks 13th on a global list of, compiled by a group of nonprofits including The Rainforest Action Network and the Sierra Club."

        "link": "https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/05/tech/lemon8-tiktok/index.html",
        "text": "In the days after TikTok\u2019s CEO wasby Congress for the first time, many TikTok users began posting about an alternative platform called Lemon8, sometimes with eerily similar language.Multiple creators described the app as being like \u201cif Pinterest and Instagram had a baby, with TikTok\u2019s algorithm.\u201d Some compared it toand encouraged other influencers to join the app before it grows. They also asked followers to share their Lemon8 usernames in the comments.As it turned out, the app wasn\u2019t just a random alternative to TikTok. Lemon8 is a social media platform launched in the United States earlier this year by TikTok\u2019s Chinese parent company ByteDance amid federal andefforts toin the country over national security concerns.The similarities in the videos comparing the new service to Instagram and Pinterest, which were posted by both English and Spanish-speaking creators, raised questions about whether people were being paid to promote the new app on TikTok. But despite that speculation \u2014 and the mounting scrutiny on TikTok and ByteDance \u2014 a growing number of US users and influencers are now eagerly touting Lemon8, with its focus on photos and highly curated, informational or \u201caspirational\u201d content.\u201cWe have to talk about TikTok\u2019s new sister app,\u201d a creator said in one such video.\u201cI\u2019ve seen a lot of bigger content creators that I love on it and promoting it on their Instagram stories, so I thought, \u2018okay, it\u2019s my time to hop on this bandwagon,\u2019\u201d said Melanie Cruz, who got her start creating content as a YouTube vlogger in high school around 2018. \u201cI like that it\u2019s something simple, it\u2019s nothing too in your face \u2026 it\u2019s not overwhelming.\u201dThe US government is once again threatening to ban TikTok. What you should knowLemon8 has been downloaded just over one million times in the United States since it became available on US app stores in February, and had around half a million daily active US users last month, according to intelligence platform Apptopia.The early traction for Lemon8 hints at the whack-a-mole challenge lawmakers could face in reining in TikTok and other social media platforms. It also carries some hints of TikTok\u2019s own rise, which wasfueled in part by ByteDance spending heavily to advertise the service on rival platforms Facebook and Snapchat. This time, however, the best place to promote the next TikTok may be on TikTok itself.The New York Timeslast month that ByteDance had begun early marketing efforts for Lemon8 that included working with influencers. Now, some creators featured on Lemon8\u2019s \u201cfor you\u201d feed appear to be disclosing their work with the company using the hashtag #Lemon8Partner in their captions.A ByteDance company source said that Lemon8 is still in its early days and testing how to work with creators. They said ByteDance has not launched any formal marketing efforts for Lemon8, but in some cases has made deals to pay creators to post on the platform. However, they denied rumors that ByteDance had paid creators to promote the new app on TikTok.ByteDance has also recently listed open jobs for Lemon8 creator partnerships roles, according to postings viewed by CNN. \u201cLemon8 is a social media platform committed to building a diverse and inclusive community where people can discover new content and creators every day,\u201d the job postings read.Lemon8\u2019s photo-heavy focus marks a stark shift away from most of the major social apps that, following TikTok\u2019s lead, have gone all-in on endlessly scrollable short-form videos in recent years.Lemon8\u2019s homepage is a \u201cfor you\u201d feed where users can scroll through content, similar to TikTok, but instead of videos, the feed is two columns of still images. When you click through to a post, it might be a single photo or a carousel of images. It\u2019s also possible to post videos on the app, but they\u2019re less popular.The app is heavily centered on beauty and lifestyle content \u2014 the \u201cfor you\u201d page can be sorted into six categories including fashion, home and travel. Many of the posts feature lengthy captions, and users can also edit images to include text overlays. On top of similarities to Instagram and Pinterest, Lemon8 looks nearly identical to the Chinese app Xiaohongshu.Still, the app lacks some standard social platform features such as messaging and the option to tag other users in posts.A recent scroll through Lemon8\u2019s \u201cfor you\u201d page showed before-and-after photos of a botox treatment, a \u201cno restrictions\u201d day-long eating plan, book recommendations, black tie wedding attire tips and \u201c10 recent girly Amazon buys I do NOT regret.\u201d\u201cIt seems like people love it or hate it,\u201d Madison Bravenec, a health coach and content creator, said of the app\u2019s focus on aesthetics. But she added that the app\u2019s targeted focus on certain types of content has made it easier to find a community that\u2019s interested in the wellness content she likes to create, whereas the most popular posts on TikTok often have to appeal to a wider audience.Some creators say Lemon8 is filling a hole in the social media ecosystem that was left when Instagram moved to prioritize short-form video content in order to better compete with TikTok, frustrating many creators who joined the app for its original focus on photos.\u201cWe\u2019re not videographers, we\u2019re not the types of people who would like to change the ways we create content and communicate with others just because a platform is prioritizing one deliverable over the other,\u201d said Can Ahtam, a professional photographer who joined Instagram more than a decade ago. \u201cSo all of us did feel the impact of reach being lower with the photos we were sharing [on Instagram].\u201dAhtam added: \u201cIf we were to compare them side-by-side right now, Lemon8 would have the upper hand in photos being shared.\u201dLemon8\u2019s userbase remains a far cry from the 150 million users TikTokit has in the United States.Still, in videos reviewing Lemon8, some creators have pondered whether the app could ultimately function as a replacement if TikTok were to get banned in the United States, preserving the content recommendation algorithm that helped make TikTok one of the country\u2019s most popular apps and launched the careers of countless influencers.But if TikTok were to go down, Lemon8 would likely go with it, according to James Lewis, director of the strategic technologies program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.\u201cThe concern is still the same, which is that ByteDance is a Chinese company subject to Chinese law,\u201d Lewis said. \u201cIf it collects [users\u2019 personal] information, then you\u2019ve got the same problem.\u201dA key safety executive at TikTok is leaving as lawmakers keep pressure on the appTikTok, for its part, has said that its app does not pose a risk to US users, and that the Chinese government has never asked for US user data.The practical ramifications for creators of a TikTok (and, perhaps by extension, Lemon8) ban \u2014 if one were enacted \u2014 would still likely be months away, if not more. Lewis said he doesn\u2019t expect any nationwide legislation to be passed before the end of this year, and it would almost certainly face legal challenges that could drag out its implementation if it did.By launching a new app even with TikTok in the spotlight, \u201cByteDance clearly doesn\u2019t feel like they\u2019re at risk,\u201d Lewis said. And many creators say they\u2019re not necessarily worried either.Even if TikTok and Lemon8 were banned, Cruz said, \u201cI already have a following on all the other platforms.\u201d"

        "text": "The White House on Thursday announced a series of measures to address the challenges of artificial intelligence, driven by the sudden popularity of tools such as ChatGPT and amid rising concerns about the technology\u2019s potential risks for discrimination, misinformation and privacy.The US government plans to introduce policies that shape how federal agencies procure and use AI systems, the White House said. The step could significantly influence the market for AI products and control how Americans interact with AI on government websites, at security checkpoints and in other settings.The National Science Foundation will also spend $140 million to promote research and development in AI, the White House added. The funds will be used to create research centers that seek to apply AI to issues such as climate change, agriculture and public health, according to the administration.The plan came the same day that Vice President Kamala Harris and other administration officials met with the CEOs of Google, Microsoft, ChatGPT-creator OpenAI and Anthropic to emphasize the importance of ethical and responsible AI development. And it coincides withlaunched Thursday into the risks and benefits of AI.\u201cTech companies have a fundamental responsibility to make sure their products are safe and secure, and that they protect people\u2019s rights before they\u2019re deployed or made public,\u201d a senior Biden administration official told reporters on a conference call ahead of the meeting.Officials on the call cited a range of risks the public faces in the widespread adoption of AI tools, including the possible use of AI-created deepfakes and misinformation that could undermine the democratic process. Job losses linked to rising automation, biased algorithmic decision-making, physical dangers arising from autonomous vehicles and the threat of AI-powered malicious hackers are also on the White House\u2019s list of concerns.As Thursday\u2019s meeting was underway, President Joe Biden stopped by for a surprise visit, a person familiar with the situation told CNN. A White House official said Biden has been briefed extensively on ChatGPT and has even tested it out himself.In a readout following the meeting, the White House said Biden and Harris \u201cwere clear that in order to realize the benefits that might come from advances in AI, it is imperative to mitigate both the current and potential risks AI poses to individuals, society, and national security.\u201dBiden \u201cunderscored that companies have a fundamental responsibility to make sure their products are safe and secure before they are deployed or made public,\u201d according to the White House.Harris, meanwhile, reminded the companies they have an \u201cethical, moral and legal responsibility to ensure the safety and security of their products,\u201d and that they will be held accountable under existing US laws, according to a White House statement on the meeting.Harris also teased the possibility of additional future regulation of the rapidly evolving industry.\u201cGovernment, private companies, and others in society must tackle these challenges together,\u201d Harris said in a statement. \u201cPresident Biden and I are committed to doing our part \u2014 including by advancing potential new regulations and supporting new legislation \u2014 so that everyone can safely benefit from technological innovations.\u201dSpeaking to reporters following the meeting, White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre described the conversation as \u201chonest\u201d and \u201cfrank.\u201d\u201cWe had four CEOs here meeting with the vice president and the president,\u201d she said. \u201cThat shows how seriously we take it.\u201dJean-Pierre said greater transparency from AI companies, including giving the public the ability to assess and evaluate their products, will be crucial to ensuring AI systems are safe and trustworthy.One company that has invested heavily in AI and that was noticeably absent from Thursday\u2019s meeting was Meta, Facebook\u2019s parent. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg hasas the company\u2019s \u201csingle largest investment\u201d and has said the technology will be integrated into all of its products. But it currently does not offer a ChatGPT-like tool among its services.An administration official told CNN Thursday that Meta was not invited to the CEO summit. \u201cIt was focused on companies currently leading in the space,\u201d the official told CNN, \u201cespecially on the consumer-facing product side.\u201dMeta declined to comment on the matter.The meeting marked the latest example of the federal government acknowledging concerns from the rapid development and deployment of new AI tools, and trying to find ways to address some of the risks.Testifying before Congress, members of the Federal Trade CommissionAI could \u201cturbocharge\u201d fraud and scams. Its chair, Lina Khan, wrote in athis week that the US government has ample existing legal authority to regulate AI by leaning on its mandate to protect consumers and competition.Last year, the Biden administration unveiled a proposal for ancalling for developers to respect the principles of privacy, safety and equal rights as they create new AI tools.Earlier this year, the Commerce Department released voluntary risk management guidelines for AI that it said could help organizations and businesses \u201cgovern, map, measure and manage\u201d the potential dangers in each part of the development cycle. In April, the Department also said it ison the best policies for regulating AI, including through audits and industry self-regulation.The US government isn\u2019t alone in seeking to shape AI development. European officials anticipate hammering out AI legislationthat could have major implications for AI companies around the world."

Experts say the treatment of companies, owned by, has served as cautionary tales for businesses deciding how to position themselves abroad and has even led to the recruitment of foreign executives to help curry favor in certain markets.\u201cBeing [seen as] a Chinese company is potentially bad for doing global business and comes with a variety of risks,\u201d said Scott Kennedy, a senior adviser and trustee chair in Chinese business and economics at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.\u201cIt may affect your image, it may affect how regulators around the world literally treat you and your access to credit, markets, partners, in some cases land, raw materials.\u201dTemu, the online marketplace that has grown rapidlyand, casts itself as a US company owned by a multinational firm. The firm is Boston-based and its parent, PDD, lists its head office as Dublin. But it wasn\u2019t always the case.Until earlier this year, PDD was headquartered in Shanghai and known as Pinduoduo, also the name of its hugely popular e-commerce platform in China. But in the last few months, the companyandto the Irish capital, without providing an explanation.'Too good to be true?' As Shein and Temu take off, so does the scrutinyShein, meanwhile, has long played down its origins.In 2021, as the online fast fashion giantin the United States, its website did not mention its backstory, including the fact that it first launched in China. Nor did it say where it was based, stating only that it was an \u201cinternational\u201d firm.Another Shein, which has since been archived, lists frequently asked questions, including one about its headquarters. The company\u2019s answer outlined \u201ckey operation centers in Singapore, China, the US and other major global markets,\u201d without directly identifying its main hub.Now, itsclearly states Singapore as its headquarters, alongside \u201ckey operation centers in the US and other major global markets,\u201d without mentioning China.As for Binance,about whether its lack of a physical global headquarters is a deliberate strategy to avoid regulation. In addition, thereported in March that the firm had obscured its links to China for years, including the use of an office there until at least the end of 2019.In a statement this week, Binance told CNN that the company \u201cdoes not operate in China, nor do we have any technology, including servers or data, based in China.\u201d\u201cWhile we did have a customer service call center based in China to service global Mandarin speakers, those employees who wished to remain with the company were offered relocation assistance starting in 2021,\u201d a spokesperson said.PDD, Shein and TikTok did not respond to requests for comment on this story.It\u2019s easy to see why companies are taking this approach.\u201cWhen you talk about corporate entities that are seen as being in one way or another connected to China, you sort of start opening this can of worms,\u201d said Ben Cavender, a Shanghai-based managing director of strategy consultancy China Market Research Group.\u201cThere\u2019s almost this automatic take by the US government that these companies are potentially a risk,\u201d because of the inference that they could share data with the Chinese government, or act in a nefarious capacity, he added.Huawei was theof the political backlash a few years back. Now, consultants point, and the ferocity with which it has beenby US lawmakers over its Chinese ownership and potential data security risks.The thinking goes that since the Chinese government enjoys significant leverage over businesses under its jurisdiction, ByteDance and thus indirectly, TikTok, could be forced to cooperate with a broad range of security activities, including possibly the transfer of data about its users. The same concern could, in theory, apply to any Chinese company.\u201cI think downplaying their roots allows them to navigate these tensions and build relationships with US customers and regulators,\u201d said Garrett Sheridan, CEO of corporate advisory firm Lotis Blue Consulting.\u201cAgainst that backdrop, if you\u2019re a Chinese entrepreneur and your goal is to maximize your access to consumers \u2026 it\u2019s smart to try to make your company more multinational, more international and less kind of China-centric.\u201dThe risks for companies are rising as policymakerswhether a company is Chinese or has Chinese owners.

The move was condemned by the Chinese government, which dismissed India\u2019s grounds of protecting national security as \u201can excuse\u201d to target businesses with Chinese ties.The US-China chip war is spilling over to EuropeBinance\u2019s Zhao also implied there could be prejudice at play. In his blog post, he pushed back on media descriptions of him as a \u201cChinese Canadian CEO,\u201d saying: \u201cI am a Canadian citizen, period.\u201d\u201cThe inference is that because we have ethnically Chinese employees, and perhaps because I am ethnically Chinese, we are secretly in the pocket of the Chinese government,\u201d Zhao wrote. \u201cThis is obviously not true.\u201dThere is a potential risk of \u201cracism or general xenophobia\u201d clouding some perceptions of Chinese-led companies, Cavender said.In 2020, former US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi erroneouslyZooma \u201cChinese entity\u201d in a television interview, leading critics tothat it was an American company.That year, CEO Eric Yuanthat if US-China tensions grew, Zoom could have to rethink its relations to China, where it had a research center. \u201cIf things get worse, we do have a plan,\u201d he said.Consumers, though, appear to be shrugging off the issue.

        "link": "https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/05/economy/real-wages-inflation/index.html",
        "text": "Wages are now finally beating inflation, according to the latest quarterly data on wage growth. But, with a widely expected recession still looming, that might not last. That is, unless you work in a certain industry.In the first three months of the year, median weekly earnings for full-time and salaried workers were 6.1% higher compared to the same period a year ago, outpacing the 5.8%during that period. And Friday\u2019s jobs report showed that workers\u2019 paychecks grew in April by 16 cents, or 0.5%, to $33.36 an hour on average. That was the biggest monthly increase since March 2022, though wage growth had gradually slowed since then.Markets surge as regional banking stocks rebound and the April jobs report surprisesWorkers who switched jobs are still raking in higher wages than those who choose to stay; and employees in industries struggling to hire, such as leisure and hospitality, are also enjoying fatter paychecks, economists said.\u201cThe folks who left one company and went to another are the ones who are still benefiting from wage growth,\u201d said Morgan Llewellyn, chief data scientist at Jobvite.Part of the continued strength in wage growth largely has to do with employers\u2019 difficulty in hiring, which varies by industry. A recent survey from the National Federation of Independent Business showed that 53% of small businesses reported \u201cfew or no qualified applicants for the positions they were trying to fill.\u201d The report said that vacancies in construction, transportation and wholesale remain the hardest to fill.\u201cThis is still an incredibly tight labor market and employers are still having to beat out competition to secure talent,\u201d said Julia Pollak, chief economist at ZipRecruiter. \u201cAnd even if employers want to get back to normal and control wage growth, they just don\u2019t have much choice but to raise wages to increase recruitment and retention.\u201dConstrained labor supply might be a reason why employers are still having such a hard time hiring. Labor force participation, or the share of workers employed or seeking a job, stood at 62.6%, below 63.3% in February 2020, ahead of the pandemic. Participation among \u201cprime age\u201d workers, those between the ages of 25 and 54, has already made a full recovery, but it remains below pre-pandemic levels for workers in their early twenties and those older than 54.It could also be due to workers simply wanting other kinds of jobs, such as ones that pay more or allow for remote work, Pollak said.\u201cWage growth has still been higher for job changers than job stayers and that suggests that there\u2019s still a shortage of labor for some companies,\u201d said Dawn Fay, operational president at staffing firm Robert Half.Fay said that workers such as accountants, systems analysts and customer service professionals remain in demand and are still enjoying robust compensation packages, even from a year ago. She said she expects demand for those workers to persist even during an economic downturn because of their \u201ccore skill sets.\u201dMany economists, including those at the Federal Reserve, expect the US economy to. A recession is defined as a broad economic downturn that typically includes a weak jobs market. That means wage and payroll growth would slow considerably, but not for every worker.\u201cIf you think about a recession caused by rising interest rates, it won\u2019t stop you from aging or needing a knee replacement, so there won\u2019t be much of an impact on demand for health care,\u201d said Llewellyn. \u201cBut it would have an effect on transportation, manufacturing, and other industries that are interest-rate sensitive.\u201dWorkers in the leisure and hospitality sector, which includes bars, restaurants and hotels, have also enjoyed some of the strongest wage gains. That\u2019s because pent-up demand after pandemic lockdowns means consumers are still traveling at a strong clip. It\u2019s also a sector that has been slow to bounce back after losing millions of workers in the first months of the pandemic \u2014 and now, many of those workers are reluctant to return to what they see as a low-pay, unstable work environment.US labor market heats back up, adding 253,000 jobs in AprilIf the economy heads into a recession and consumers cut back on discretionary spending like travel and dining out, that could potentially undo those wage gains in leisure and hospitality, Llewellyn said.Demand for health care might even become greater because of the country\u2019s aging population, he said. Health care firms added 40,000 jobs in April and averaged a gain of about 47,000 jobs a month in the prior six months.Workers will also be less likely to switch jobs if there is a recession, thus weakening wage growth figures across the board, Llewellyn added.Still, the US labor market is still holding up, even as other data points to a slowing economy. Employers added 253,000 jobs in April, trouncing economists\u2019 expectation, and the unemployment rate fell to 3.4%, matching the lowest rate since 1969.At the same time, US economic growth slowed to an annual rate of 1.1% in the January-through-March period, a weaker rate than the prior two quarters; and a key measure of business investment, orders for nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft, fell in three of the four months through March. The latest surveys released by the Institute for Supply Management showed that economic activity in the US manufacturing sector contracted for the sixth consecutive month in April."

        "text": "The US labor market that wasjust got a touch of heat.The economy added 253,000 jobs in April, according to data released Friday by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. It\u2019s a surprising increase at a time when many indicators were pointing to a slowdown in the job market.The unemployment rate fell to 3.4% \u2014 matching a 53-year low hit in January \u2014 from 3.5% the month before. The labor force participation rate held steady at 62.6%.Economists were expecting job growth to decline for the third consecutive month, 180,000 jobs to be added, and for the unemployment rate to increase to 3.6%, according to Refinitiv. Only three economists of the 87 polled by Refinitiv had projected job growth at or above 253,000.The net job gains seen in April represent, which was revised down to 165,000 from 236,000 jobs, BLS data shows. Some of the largest increases were in the sectors of private education and health services, professional and business services, and leisure and hospitality.\u201cPayrolls came in better than expected, the unemployment rate fell, andreaccelerated; all of these data points show that the labor market remains on somewhat solid footing,\u201d Sameer Samana, senior global market strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute, said in a statement. \u201cWhile the [Federal Reserve] has laid the groundwork for a pause at the June meeting, additional strong economic data would keep them firmly on the side of a tightening bias.\u201dIn April, average hourly earnings trending up, rising 0.5% from the previous month and increasing to a 4.4% gain over the past year. In March, the monthly and annual measures of wage gains in the private sector was up 0.3% and 4.3%, respectively.Despite the upside surprise, the labor market does appear to be still slowing to a more sustainable pace of growth, Gus Faucher, senior vice president and chief economist of the PNC Financial Services Group, told CNN.February\u2019s total was revised down as well \u2014 to 248,000 from 326,000 \u2014 resulting in average job growth of 222,000 for the past three months, BLS data shows. During the second half of last year, job growth averaged 353,000 per month.\u201cSo we are seeing a slowing in the labor market, and that\u2019s good news from an inflation perspective,\u201d Faucher said. \u201cBusinesses are still trying to hire, demand for labor is still strong, but it\u2019s not quite as strong as it was even in late 2022. For businesses, it looks like they\u2019re finding that perhaps it\u2019s a little bit easier to find workers now.\u201dThat\u2019s the case for one of the longest-operating businesses in Colorado.Brenda Fishman wears many hats at Lakeside Amusement Park, anestled in a tiny Colorado town near the northwest edge of Denver.On Thursday afternoon, she jumped in as switchboard operator when the phone rang.\u201cThe person who should be answering the phone, we haven\u2019t been able find,\u201d said Fishman, whose grandfather purchased Lakeside back in the 1930s.Fishman, who works in operations, has been poring through \u201chundreds and hundreds and hundreds\u201d of job applications in recent weeks. Lakeside is gearing up for the summer season and its soft opening next week.\u201cPeople need work,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople aren\u2019t getting hired, and they want to work.\u201dThe number of applicants for this coming season is far greater than last year, she said.That would be a positive development for Lakeside, which last year resorted to limiting food options, closing games and shutting down some rides because of staffing shortages, she said.However, it\u2019s not just the amount of people applying but also who\u2019s applying for jobs that is putting a unique spin on this year\u2019s hiring activities.Far more adults are vying for positions, she said, as well as people looking for a second job and people who previously worked in completely unrelated fields such as nursing, dental, and mid-level management.\u201cThis goes back to many, many decades ago when people were tightening their belts and saving up,\u201d she said. \u201cWe did not see the same feeling when [the Great Recession] happened. This is more marked at the moment.\u201dNationally, the job gains would likely have been even higher if the labor market weren\u2019t so supply-constrained, Julia Pollak, chief economist at ZipRecruiter, said in a note.The unemployment rate has been below 4% for more than a year, indicating a very tight labor market, she said.\u201cLabor force participation was flat in April, holding hiring back,\u201d she wrote. \u201cWith few people coming in off the sidelines, new jobs went to those actively seeking employment. As a result, Black and Hispanic unemployment continued to fall, with Black unemployment hitting a new all-time low [at 4.7%].\u201dHowever, the job growth seen in April wasn\u2019t fully broad-based, Gregory Daco, EY Parthenon chief economist, told CNN. He noted that the BLS\u2019 diffusion index, which measures how many industries are adding jobs, measured 57.4% for last month, staying near a pre-pandemic low.\u201cWe are still seeing growth in some sectors, but we\u2019re also seeing other sectors that are cutting back,\u201d he said.Among those with net losses were wholesale trade and temporary health services.\u201cThe continued decline in temporary help services employment may start tripping some traditional recession alarm bells, but given the rapid pace of hiring in recent years, it may simply be another sign of moderation,\u201d Nick Bunker, head of economic research at Indeed Hiring Lab, said in a statement. \u201cWorkers, employers, and policymakers should be encouraged about the current state of affairs, but it\u2019s unclear how much longer it can endure.\u201dBusinesses in leisure and hospitality and health care \u2014 sectors that have wrangled with worker shortages during the recovery from the pandemic \u2014have steadily added jobs and starting to find a better balance in the supply and demand equation, noted Patrick Combs, interim chief executive officer at the Chicago Cook Workforce Partnership. The public workforce organization in Chicago recently hosted its sixth annual Hospitality Hires Chicago job fair, where dozens of the 300-plus attendees were offered jobs.\u201cThere was a much closer alignment to the number of people looking for work, and the number of employers looking to hire,\u201d McCombs told CNN. \u201cWe\u2019re definitely not at that place where we were six months to a year ago, where there was almost desperation on the side of hospitality employers to find people and where they were cutting hours or cutting down operations.He added: \u201cIt\u2019s looking a lot healthier, I would say for that labor market.\u201dThe lion\u2019s share of recent economic data pointed to a more pronounced softening in the labor market, which has been going gangbusters during the past three years to reclaim the 22 million jobs lost at the outset of the pandemic and grow beyond that.The BLS\u2019 Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey report for March showed that, hiring was flat, quits dropped and layoffs spiked.The Challenger, Gray & Christmas read on layoff announcements showed that the January-April job cuts of 337,411 was the highest total for that period going back to 2009 (excluding 2020). And weekly jobless claims have slowly trended up in recent weeks, although they remain below historical averages.But one indicator warning of some potential heat came Wednesday, when payroll processor ADP released its monthly look at private-sector hiring and wage activity.that private-sector employers added an estimated 296,000 jobs in April, crushing economists\u2019 expectations for a gain of 148,000 and more than doubling the prior month\u2019s tally of 142,000.A continued slowdown in job growth has been anticipated given the natural course of an employment recovery as well as the effects of the Fed\u2019s interest rates and broader uncertainty around the banking sector.The persistent strength of the labor market, however, provides a sense of hope that a \u201csoft landing\u201d is still possible,, noting the path of bringing inflation down without an overwhelming rise in unemployment and subsequent recession.\u201cThis is what a soft landing would look like, with job growth gradually slowing to a more sustainable pace,\u201d PNC\u2019s Faucher said. \u201cThat being said, we won\u2019t know whether we\u2019ve achieved a soft landing probably until the end of this year.\u201dAnd while a lot can happen and a lot of data will be released \u2014 including another jobs report \u2014 in the 40 days before the Fed\u2019s next policymaking meeting, today\u2019s hotter-than expected print could influence a more hawkish tilt from the central bank, which is weighing a pause after 10 straight rate hikes.\u201cI think this is the type of report that is one that will keep the excessively data-dependent Fed on a tightening bias,\u201d Gregory Daco, chief economist at EY Parthenon, said in an interview with CNN. \u201cUnfortunately, the reality today is that excessive data dependence is a very risky proposition in such a volatile macro environment.\u201d"

He worked part-time at Google for a decade on the tech giant\u2019s AI development efforts, but he has since come to have concerns about the technology and his role in advancing it.\u201cI console myself with the normal excuse: If I hadn\u2019t done it, somebody else would have,\u201d Hinton told the, which was first to report his decision.In a tweet Monday, Hinton said he left Google so he could speak freely about the risks of AI, rather than because of a desire to criticize Google specifically.\u201cI left so that I could talk about the dangers of AI without considering how this impacts Google,\u201d Hintonin a tweet. \u201cGoogle has acted very responsibly.\u201dJeff Dean, chief scientist at Google, said Hinton \u201chas made foundational breakthroughs in AI\u201d and expressed appreciation for Hinton\u2019s \u201cdecade of contributions at Google.\u201d\u201cWe remain committed to a responsible approach to AI,\u201d Dean said in a statement provided to CNN. \u201cWe\u2019re continually learning to understand emerging risks while also innovating boldly.\u201dHinton\u2019s decision to step back from the company and speak out on the technology comes as a growing number of lawmakers, advocacy groups and tech insiders have raised alarms about the potential for a new crop of AI-powered chatbots to spread misinformation and displace jobs.The wave of attention around ChatGPT late last year helped renew an arms race among tech companies to develop and deploy similar AI tools in their products. OpenAI, Microsoft and Google are at the forefront of this trend, but IBM, Amazon, Baidu and Tencent are working on similar technologies.In March, some prominent figures in techcalling for artificial intelligence labs to stop the training of the most powerful AI systems for at least six months, citing \u201cprofound risks to society and humanity.\u201d The letter,by the Future of Life Institute, a nonprofitby Elon Musk,came just two weeks after OpenAIGPT-4, an even more powerful version of the technology that powers ChatGPT.

        "text": "High prices, rising interest rates and banking uncertainty be damned:.Employers added 253,000 jobs in April, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported Friday.That\u2019s a good chunk more than economists were expecting, making this jobs report the 12th out of the last 13 to come in \u201chot.\u201dHere are some takeaways from the report and what it could mean for workers, job seekers, employers, the Federal Reserve and everyone in between:When the Federal Reserve startedback in March 2022, concerns grew about the potential collateral damage: How many Americans could lose their jobs as a result?The blunt-force effect of rate hikes \u2014 that make borrowing money more costly and in turn reduce demand and prices \u2014 was expected to send a chill through the nation\u2019s red-hot labor market, which at the time had a historically low 3.6% unemployment rate., the economy added more than a quarter of a million jobs and the unemployment rate dipped down again to a decades-low 3.4%.\u201cThe American labor market right now is simply unstoppable,\u201d RSM economist Joseph Brusuelas wrote in a note Friday. \u201cIt\u2019s a little like how sports commentators used to describe defending basketball great Michael Jordan: One can\u2019t stop him, one can only hope to contain him.\u201dAnd for job seekers and workers, that\u2019s a great thing:\u201cYou want a job, it\u2019s yours for the asking,\u201d Chris Rupkey, chief economist at FwdBonds, wrote in a note.Last month\u2019s job growth may have been stronger than economists expected, but the latest BLS report also noted that the previously reported estimates for February and March were revised downward by a combined 149,000 jobs.Those revisions bring average job growth down to 222,000 for the past three months. While that\u2019s above the average 183,000 monthly gain seen in the decade before the pandemic, it\u2019s a far cry below what was seen during the economic rebound of the past two years (when monthly job gains averaged 399,000 in 2022 and 606,000 in 2021).\u201cWe are seeing a slowing in the labor market, and that\u2019s good news from an inflation perspective,\u201d Gus Faucher, chief economist with the PNC Financial Services Group, told CNN. \u201cBusinesses are still trying to hire, demand for labor is still strong, but it\u2019s not quite as strong as it was even in late 2022. For businesses, it looks like they\u2019re finding that perhaps it\u2019s a little bit easier to find workers now.\u201dThe ongoing resilience of the labor market also helps to bolster hopes that it\u2019s still possible for the Fed to bring down inflation without jettisoning millions of people to the unemployment rolls and triggering a recession.\u201cThis is what a soft landing would look like, with job growth gradually slowing to a more sustainable pace,\u201d Faucher added. \u201cThat being said, we won\u2019t know whether we\u2019ve achieved a soft landing probably until the end of this year.\u201dThe Black unemployment rate tumbled to a record low in April for the second month in a row, providing fresh evidence of America\u2019s historic jobs boom.The Black unemployment rate dropped to 4.7% last month, compared with 5% the prior month. That marks the lowest level on records that go back to 1972 and is a sharp drop from 5.7% as recently as February.The milestone comes just three years after the Covid-19 pandemic caused mass layoffs that pushed the Black unemployment rate as high as 16.8%.While on its face this is promising news, the rate decline was accompanied by a drop in Black labor force participation and employment, said Heidi Shierholz, a former Labor Department chief economist who now serves as the president of the Economic Policy Institute.\u201cMake no mistake, the Black [unemployment] rate is still too high,\u201d Shierholz. \u201cDue to the impact of structural racism on the labor market, [Black & Hispanic workers] have much higher [unemployment] rates than White [workers]. But the strong jobs recovery has brought [Black and Hispanic unemployment] down far faster than in the past.\u201dFriday\u2019s jobs report showed that average hourly earnings grew in April by 16 cents, or 0.5%, to $33.36, the biggest month-over-month gain since March 2022, though wage growth had cooled since then.From a year earlier, wages increased 4.4%, up slightly from the prior month, but down from the 5.9% rise in March of last year.complicates the Fed\u2019s mission to bring down price increases because higher labor costs could put upward pressure on inflation.When wages go up, that\u2019s good news for consumer spending and the economy. But for the Fed, it\u2019s a roadblock, noted Scott Anderson, chief economist at Bank of the West.\u201cThe more stubborn the resilience in job and wage gains, the longer the Fed will need to remain in a restrictive monetary stance, and the bigger the chance of an economic downturn at some point this year,\u201d he wrote.For the first four months of the year, job growth has averaged 285,000 per month, more people are participating in the labor market, and job gains are occurring in even some of the most challenged sectors such as manufacturing and construction, Wells Fargo economists Sarah House and Michael Pugliese wrote in a note.But the storm clouds are gathering.\u201cWith each passing month, the tailwinds from efforts to restaff post-lockdowns are getting weaker, while the hiring headwinds from tighter monetary policy are getting stronger,\u201d they wrote. \u201cThe jobs market remains on solid ground, but cracks are emerging. Jobless claims are ticking higher, job openings are rapidly declining, and temporary help employment fell once again in April, with the latter being a useful indicator of labor demand growth on the margin.\u201dPlenty can happen and plenty of data will drop between now and the Fed\u2019s next meeting, in June.Some important economic reports will be released next week, including the Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Monday, which will provide some insight into lending conditions, and the key inflation gauges of theand.Separately, President Joe Biden is expected to meet with congressional leaders to hold discussions about raising the debt ceiling.Not doing so would be \u201cunprecedented,\u201d Fed Chair Jerome Powell said this week, adding that the consequences to the US economy could be highly uncertain and \u201cquite averse.\u201d"

        "text": "National Transportation Safety Board chair Jennifer Homendy sharply criticized federal regulators Thursday for not doing enough to monitor and test automatic driving technologies.She spoke at an event marking the opening of a Consumer Reports facility that will test increasingly common systems and features such as automatic braking, lane-departure technology and advanced cruise control. More than half of new vehicles sold today have at least some of these systems, according to Consumer Reports.\u201cThe federal government isn\u2019t doing their job in that area. You\u2019re ahead of them,\u201d Homendy said of Consumer Reports. \u201cThe NTSB has called on regulators to set performance minimums for these features, to test vehicles rigorously against those standards and provide the results to consumers. But we\u2019re still waiting.\u201dPrivate groups like Consumer Reports and the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, which is financed by the insurance industry, have the ability to respond more quickly than government agencies in the face of rapidly advancing technologies, said Kelly Funkhouser, head of connected and automated vehicles at Consumer Reports.In reality, both public and private agencies are needed to prod safety improvements, she said.She gave the example of automatic emergency braking, a technology that has been proven to reduce crashes and which is now standard on most passenger vehicles sold in the US. That\u2019s because the IIHS and Consumer Reports worked directly with automakers to get them to add it.\u201cConsumer Reports and IIHS tried to get ahead of this because there was no movement from regulators,\u201d she said.The NTSB is not a regulatory agency,and can only offer recommendations to private industry, such as automakers, and other agencies like the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.NHTSA is the federal agency thatregulates auto safety and maintains a database of crash test ratings atSaferCar.gov. It also lists which basic crash prevention systems vehicles have, such as \u201cCrash Imminent Braking\u201d\u2013 more commonly called automatic emergency braking \u2013 and \u201cLane Departure Warning.\u201d It also lists whether each one \u201cmeets performance criteria.\u201dBut it doesn\u2019t provide comparative ratings or details. For instance, some emergency braking systems can stop collisions only at very low speeds, said Funkhouser. Also, some don\u2019t stop for pedestrians or bicyclists, but others will.TheNTSB has suggested NHTSA employ a five-star rating system to forward collision avoidance systems, for example, instead of just noting whether they meet minimum standards.And NHTSA has, including possibly requesting comment on ways to develop ratings systems for these technologies. It has also recently begun its ownConsumer Reports\u2019 new \u201cADAS Loop\u201d at the organization\u2019s auto testing center in Colchester, Connecticut is designed to test advanced driver assist systems like Tesla\u2019s Autopilot, and similar systems from automakers like Mercedes-Benz, Nissan and General Motors.These systems can combine technologies like automated lane-keeping assistance and automated cruise control to make vehicles seem almost like they\u2019re driving themselves.Crucially, though, vehicles with these systems are not self-driving cars. For the most part, these systems operate only in relatively simple driving situations, such as on multi-lane highways without intersections, and a human driver should be paying attention at all times.Consumer Reports test drivers will still use an actual interstate highway to test features that only function when the car recognizes that it\u2019s on a divided highway. (Certain technologies from some automakers are restricted using GPS location settings and can be enabled only on an actual highway.)But the independent test track includes intersections, on and off ramps, curves and hills to test how the systems respond to a variety of different road situations.Test drivers will be able to check how well systems work compared to one another.They will also be able to compare how good of a job they do at making sure drivers are really paying attention and at alerting drivers if their attention wanders.\u201cADAS technologies need to be tested thoroughly,\u201d Homendy said. \u201cThe stakes couldn\u2019t be higher. People put immense trust in these features, sometimes too much.\u201dThe NTSB hasautomated driving systemand has noted that it is too easy for drivers to become distracted. Many vehicles, including Teslas, rely on just the slight pull of a driver\u2019s hand on the steering wheel to indicate that the driver is staying alert. Much better are systems that use cameras inside the car to watch the driver\u2019s eyes and ensure that the driver is actually looking at the road, said Funkhouser."

Teh used One\u2019s longstanding mantra to explain theirs.\u201cIt\u2019s about unleashing real life superheroes who ignite the world with hope, strength, dreams and inspiration,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s about having children wanting posters of their favorite athletes, and parents walking into their room and saying, \u2018Yes, that\u2019s someone worth looking up to.\u2019\u201dAnd while that will undoubtedly garner some eye rolls from some bloodthirsty fans, that is not to say boiling feuds and intense square-offs do not exist in their more than 600-strong fighter roster.\u201cIn the end, just don\u2019t cross the line,\u201d Teh said.\u201cThis is sports. Things can get heated and emotional. But for us, you leave it in the [ring], the court, the pitch. Rivalry, confrontation, a little bit of shoving here and there, all that is part of sports. But the sport itself provides a lot of inbuilt stories and drama without having to cross that line.\u201cIf you look at the sponsors working with us, we\u2019re talking family brands like Tumi, Oculus, Disney. We\u2019re building a brand that everyone can enjoy with their kids and grandkids. That\u2019s more true to the spirit of martial arts and its traditional values.Values aside, One differs from the UFC in that it schedules different disciplines of martial arts alongside its MMA-based backbone.For example, the Colorado co-main event is a Brazilian jiu-jitsu grappling match, while there will be Muay Thai and kickboxing bouts laced throughout.The card will be broadcast on Amazon Prime Video in the US and Canada, part of a five-year media rights agreement. The intention is to \u201cdo multiple events, not just in the long-term,\u201d according to Teh, adding that it will not affect its roughly 60 shows per year across Asia.One\u2019s formal attempt to crack the North American market is a clear sign of its intention to strengthen its status as one half of what Teh calls the MMA \u201cduopoly\u201d between the \u201cbiggest in Asia and the biggest in the West.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a new market so we want to be humble\u201d, Teh said. \u201cBut the nice thing is we\u2019re not starting from scratch \u2014 we\u2019re not nobodies. The US is new, but it\u2019s not foreign. It\u2019s a priority market and we have a clear right to play, just like how Samsung sells phones in the US.\u201dThe organization had been in the red for years, but finally appears to be rounding a corner.Breaking even or becoming profitable in the three years from 2022 is a goal for the firm, whose investors include Temasek Holdings in Singapore and Sequoia Capital in the United States.andhave reported that parent company Group One is preparing for an initial public offering.One\u2019s valuation of $1.4 billion, based on itsof fundraising, is still far from the UFC\u2019s $12.1 billion, though afrom 2021 suggests the former has overtaken the latter in terms of social media video viewership with nearly 14 billion views.One\u2019s founder and CEO Chatri Sityodtong toldlast year that he \u201cappreciated all the rejections and failures through the years.\u201d\u201cWhat we\u2019re building is not a normal exercise,\u201d Teh explains. \u201cWe\u2019re not opening a cafe or starting a line of diapers \u2014 not things that you can start and on day 1 can sell. It\u2019s more like a theme park. They take years to build, and you don\u2019t monetize in all those years. But once its built and open to all, you\u2019re selling tickets, F&B, merchandise, rides, all sorts.\u201cWe have been burning quite a bit [of money], but since 2019, that number has been coming down very aggressively. Now we\u2019re at the final stage of pushing the company to profitability. Many rejections in the early days \u2014 now we have all these opportunities to monetize the IP.\u201dOutside the combat realm, One has signed a longterm media partnership deal in the Middle East, and has branched out to esports in an attempt to conquer the Asian scene ahead of the discipline\u2019s packed schedule, which includes a return to the Southeast Asian Games this month and debut at the postponed Asian Games in September.Correction: This story was updated to replace the photo credits on Dux Carvajal's pictures"

        "link": "https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/07/business/stocks-week-ahead/index.html",
        "text": "Stocks saw a comeback on Friday after four consecutive days of declines. But there are several key signs that show the market is far from shedding its worries.The Dow surged about 547 points on Friday, marking its biggest one-day gain since early January. The S&P 500 rose 1.8% and the Nasdaq Composite gained 2.3%.Still, the Dow and S&P 500 fell for the week, and the Nasdaq just barely eked out a gain. The major indexes saw steep sell-offs earlier in the week after, itsto JPMorgan Chase and reports that other regional banks were exploringspurred fears about the banking sector\u2019s stability.Investors say Friday\u2019s move was a short-term reversal, and not indicative of long-lasting optimism. In other words, Wall Street still has concerns about the banking sector\u2019s health, the Federal Reserve\u2019s interest rate trajectory and the possibility of recession.\u201cThe larger themes that we\u2019ve been thinking about are still very much in place,\u201d said David Keller, chief market strategist at StockCharts.com.That was evident in several aspects of the market.The S&P 500\u2019s health, utilities and information technology sectors rose for the week and outperformed the broad-based index. That suggests investors are positioning themselves defensively to weather potential market turbulence ahead.Health and utility stocks tend to perform well during recessions, since consumers prioritize paying for necessities like electricity and health care over discretionary purchases when their budgets are tight.While information technology is not a traditionally defensive sector, its gains were driven by mega-cap tech stocks like Apple that have been popular safety picks for investors this year.Crude prices fell for the third straight week, as turmoil in the banking sector and the Federal Reserve\u2019s latest interest rate hike strengthened fears that the economy is headed for a downturn.West Texas Intermediate crude futures, the US benchmark for oil, last week fell briefly below $70 a barrel for the first time since late March. Crude prices this year have also fallen well below record highs from 2022, when Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine sent prices soaring above $100 a barrel.Oil prices also saw a flash-crash early Thursday, falling briefly to about $63 a barrel, indicating that Wall Street is fearful about how a potential recession could stymie oil demand.The VIX, known as Wall Street\u2019s fear gauge, rose roughly 9% this week after falling for six straight weeks.The April Consumer Price Index and Producer Price Index are on deck for next week. Both are key inflation prints that could help determine the Fed\u2019s next course of action in its battle against inflation.In March,plunged to its lowest rate since May 2021, whilesaw a dramatic cooldown. The Personal Consumption Expenditures price index, the Fed\u2019s favorite inflation gauge,.But a stronghas renewed concerns that the economy is still too hot. The economy added 253,000 jobs in April, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Unemployment fell to 3.4%, matching a 53-year low reached in January. Economists had expected 180,000 jobs to be added and a 3.6% unemployment rate, according to Refinitiv.The unexpected jump in job gains after cooling economic data in recent weeks suggests that the Federal Reserve could have more room to tighten the economy. If next week\u2019s inflation data further supports the notion that the economy is hot, that could increase the likelihood that the central bank keeps interest rates higher for longer.\u201cEven with the improvements that we\u2019ve seen over the past few months in year-over-year inflation data, the level of overall inflation remains too high on an absolute basis,\u201d said Sam Millette, fixed income strategist at Commonwealth Financial Network.While economists and investors believe the Fed could pause interest rates at its next meeting in June, some are concerned that the central bank\u2019s willingness to raise rates even after three bank failures suggests that it could continue inflicting pain on the economy. The Fed on Wednesday raised interest rates by a quarter point and opened the door to a pause later this year.\u201cWhat it really says is that the economy is not in trouble, can easily handle slightly higher rates, and that the regional banking indigestion of the higher rates is not a reason to stop the fight to slow inflation,\u201d Louis Navellier, chief investment officer at Navellier & Associates, wrote in a note Friday.March wholesale inventories and first-quarter Fed Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey.Earnings report from Airbnb ().April Consumer Price Index and earnings report from Disney ().April Producer Price Index, mortgage rates and jobless claims.University of Michigan consumer sentiment and inflation expectations for May."

        "text": "YouTube\u2019s most watched daily live program in South Korea might surprise you. It is not about K-pop, it is not a K-drama, and has nothing to do with BlackPink.It is a provocative current affairs talk show called \u201c,\u201d fronted by an irreverent host, Kim Ou-joon, whose lack of deference to authority is making waves in a country where traditional media has a reputation for respectful coverage.Kim\u2019s style is reminiscent of a US late-night chat show host. Openly partisan, he says his aim is to counter-balance what he sees as a bias toward the conservative government with a liberal voice.\u201cConservative media are actively making biased reports, and I think they can do that based on their political stance,\u201d Kim told CNN. \u201cThe problem here is that they\u2019re pretending to be fair, hiding behind the mask of fairness.\u201dKim\u2019s brash style stands out all the more given recently raised concerns by the US Department of State that South Korean officials are using defamation lawsuits to restrict freedom of expression.It highlighted in a Marchthe case of broadcaster MBC, which is being sued by the Foreign Affairs Ministry for a story in which it claimed the South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol had beenmaking less-than complimentary remarks about US lawmakers.The presidential office has criticized the State Department report for \u201ca lack of accuracy,\u201d claiming it had \u201csimply collected and announced the claims of civic groups or media reports.\u201dBut taking on the conservative administration doesn\u2019t faze Kim, who has been sued for defamation on several occasions.Kim\u2019s critics meanwhile say his taste for controversy goes only one way, accusing him of paying less attention to reports involving the liberal Democratic Party.Still, the show\u2019s reputation for daring to go where others fear to tread has done wonders for its viewing figures. Every morning at 7:05 a.m., about 160,000 people tune in to hear Kim\u2019s takes on the biggest issues of the day.Industry observers say the program\u2019s popularity \u2013 it has more than 1 million subscribers and can rake in donations of 90 million won ($70,000) a day \u2013 reflects a changing media landscape.Increasingly, they say, current affairs programs are turning to YouTube to disseminate their content, drawn both by large audiences and the perception that the online arena grants greater space for freedom of expression.\u201cModesty is Nothing,\u201d for instance, is the reincarnation of a radio show called \u201cNews Factory\u201d that was taken off air after a row with the government.YouTube has a high penetration in South Korea. According to Statista, a market and consumer data statistics site, there were over 46 million YouTube users in South Korea as of January this year \u2013 more than 90% of the population (compared to over 70% in the United States).Most traditional media outlets now run their own YouTube channels, as do an increasing number of smaller, independent companies, of all political persuasions \u2013 like the right-wing(1.46 million subscribers) and the left-wing(over 1 million).They eat ice cream and read 'Harry Potter,' but these North Korean YouTubers aren't what they seemYouTube\u2019s growing influence was demonstrated in the run-up to last year\u2019s general election, when Yoon \u2013 then a candidate for the People Power Party \u2013 saw his popularity fall following a stumbling performance in a Christmas Day YouTube interview with 3ProTV.Before the show he had been neck-and-neck with opponent Lee Jae-myung from the (then ruling) Democratic Party of Korea; soon after a Gallup survey showed him trailing by around 8% points.The clout of both right and left-wing channels has also been shown in recent movements. Right-wing channels fueled rallies in support of the former President Park Geun-hye after she was impeached in 2017 over a corruption scandal; they also backed protests outside the retirement home of her liberal successor Moon Jae-in. Left-wing channels backed counter-rallies outside the current President Yoon\u2019s home.Last year the former leader of Yoon\u2019s party hit out at what he said was the \u201cevil influence\u201d of YouTube channels.YouTube channels are seen as offering a space for free speech that is all the more important given the concerns voiced by the US State Department.Jung June-hee, a professor of media at South Korea\u2019s Hanyang University ERICA campus, said most traditional outlets avoided criticizing the government \u2013 partly because of their own right-wing leanings but also because they feared being sued.\u201cAfter President Yoon Suk Yeol came to power, there have been many cases where the presidential office filed complaints to the media,\u201d Jung said.\u201cThe fear of being targeted, whether you\u2019re on the same side or not, is significant,\u201d Jung said.Over time, the lack of critical coverage meant citizens had lost confidence in traditional media and turned to the internet instead, said Rhee June-woong, a professor in communication at Seoul National University.\u201cWe can\u2019t say that traditional newspapers and broadcast media have been completely abandoned, but more and more citizens are dissatisfied with them and are seeking information, interpretation, and expression in internet media,\u201d Rhee said.CNN asked the presidential office to comment on its recent defamation lawsuits, but it has not yet received a reply.It\u2019s a dynamic that\u2019s not lost on Kim. His previous show, the publicly funded \u201cNews Factory\u201d program, had for years been Seoul\u2019s top-rated radio program (and made him one of the country\u2019s highest paid presenters).Debuting in 2016 on TBS in a two-hour slot Monday to Friday, its format was simple, featuring Kim\u2019s comments on the topic of the day and a news roundup, followed by segments featuring newsmakers from politicians and professors to journalists, artists and scientists.Its no-holds barred approach to news analysis and its live interviews broke the mold in South Korean media and made it a go-to show for politicos, said Jung June-hee, a media professor at Hanyang University.Forever young, beautiful and scandal-free: The rise of South Korea's virtual influencers\u201c(Previously) politicians didn\u2019t appear on radio shows, and morning radio shows \u2026 (mostly) used to summarize news from the night before and deliver information such as real-time traffic updates,\u201d Jung said.But its oppositional style angered conservatives, as did its coverage of the scandal surrounding former President Park. When a conservative administration returned to power in 2022 (following a stint by liberal Moon Jae-in, under whom the show enjoyed a heyday), its days were numbered.Soon after, the conservative city council announced it planned to cut TBS\u2019s budget in a move widely seen as reflecting its displeasure with \u201cNews Factory.\u201dWhile Seoul\u2019s Mayor Oh Se-hoon denied the link, in February he criticized the show for being \u201cone-sided,\u201d and the network TBS for \u201ccrossing the line that public broadcasting cannot possibly cross.\u201d\u201cIn any country, people can never be patient when public broadcasting is biased and in favor of a particular political party,\u201d Oh said.Kim took \u201cNews Factory\u201d off air in December. The next month, he launched \u201cModesty is Nothing.\u201dThe only real differences between the shows are the name and medium. The format is the same and even the studio is a replica, though it has now grown bigger \u2013 in line with Kim\u2019s ambitions.Within a week, it had surpassed a million subscribers. It has since consistently ranked top in terms of real-time daily viewership on YouTube in South Korea.To Professor Jung, it\u2019s a success that demonstrates \u201cvoices cannot be silenced.\u201dKim, meanwhile, hopes to build a show with as much recognition as any on traditional media.\u201cI will create a type of press that has not yet existed on YouTube,\u201d Kim said. \u201cThis is a declaration that I will show that canceling the show for a political reason was wrong.\u201d"

Many venues and markets opened fully for the first time since the global pandemic began in 2020.But the success comes at a time a handful of bills are wending their way through Congress that target the company\u2019s controversial and widely criticized ticketing practices and near-monopoly in the business.CEO Michael Rapino, in a release, credited the company\u2019s most recent results in part to  stadium tours for superstars Beyonce, Drake and Bruce Springsteen.\u201cDemand was so strong that even when artists added a number of additional shows, they still were not able to meet all of the fan demand,\u201d Rapino said.In a single day last November, more than two million Taylor Swift tickets were sold on Live Nation\u2019s Ticketmaster, a record for any artist.

        "text": "House Republican leadership came into power on a pro-police, tough-on-crime message. Four months later, that position is in limbo.The internal differences emerged soon after Republicans took control of the House. In January, an effort to pass a resolution expressing support for law enforcement agencies, which was meant to serve as a messaging tool, fell apart. The House GOP\u2019s behind-the-scenes disagreements reflect growing divisions inside the conference over whether to defund or restrict the Department of Justice and FBI. The contentious political issue is returning to center stage as CNN has learned that some House Republicans are actively sketching out ways to limit certain federal law enforcement programs through the appropriations process.The sponsor of the January resolution, GOP Rep. Ken Buck of Colorado, a former federal prosecutor, wanted to offer broad support for all levels of law enforcement. But a faction of hard-line members, led by House Judiciary Chair Jim Jordan of Ohio, wanted to restrict it only to state and local authorities, multiple sources told CNN.\u201cThe language that they wanted to incorporate was not something that I could agree to,\u201d said Buck.Describing the diverging viewpoints over the issue within the House GOP conference, a separate source familiar with the negotiations in January told CNN, \u201cWe were starting a big oversight of the FBI, we didn\u2019t want to lock ourselves in here,\u201d referring to the Judiciary committee\u2019s effort to investigate the FBI.Conversations with more than a dozen lawmakers since the January dust up reveal that a growing number of House Republicans are proposing ways to act on calls made by former President Donald Trump to crack down on federal law enforcement. Support started building after Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago home was searched by the FBI in August 2022,. And that support to act on the calls was super-charged byat the end of March.This comes as Jordan and the \u201cweaponization\u201d subcommittee he leads have waged a protracted campaign against the DOJ and FBI, and as House Judiciary Republicans are considering recommending various budget cuts to DOJ through the Appropriations process, a source familiar with the plans tells CNN.One of the cuts House Judiciary Republicans are exploring, which could be proposed as its own legislation or part of a broader House spending package, includes restricting funding to specific DOJ departments that refuse to respond to oversight requests, a source familiar with the discussions tells CNN.Other proposals include reigning in the ability for DOJ to give out grants, and clawing back civil asset forfeiture funds obtained through a program that allows the federal government to coordinate with state and local officials to seize cash, drugs, guns and other assets from suspects before they have been convicted of a crime, the source added.CNN has also obtained multiple letters sent by House Republicans to the House Committee on Appropriations that outline specific cuts that could be made to DOJ.DOJ declined to comment. CNN has reached out to the FBI.Democrats, meanwhile, are painting any Republicans who voice support for defunding federal law enforcement as hypocritical, just as Republicans were once framing Democrats as the party that wanted to defund the police. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, has said he will introduce a measure condemning Trump\u2019s calls to defund the DOJ, seeking to create a political liability for Republicans.Calls to defund, restructure or decentralize federal law enforcement vary across the House Republican conference, both in degree and specificity. With many moderate Republicans still balking at the idea, and since the conference has yet to reveal its budget, it is unclear if any of these proposals have broad support.Some lawmakers on the far right such asof Georgia,of Florida andhave carried Trump\u2019s mantel in calling for a full defund of the FBI.GOP Rep. Andy Biggs of Arizona, who floated the idea of defunding the FBI and DOJ at the Conservative Political Action Conference last year, told CNN, \u201cI would suggest that we look internally at a line item by line-item basis in those two areas, DOJ and FBI, and make them justify everything. Start it out at a 0 basis.\u201dBuck, meanwhile told CNN, \u201cI will not support any drastic cut in appropriations.\u201dWhile Jordan said he wanted to support rank-and-file agents at the FBI, he said vaguely \u201ceverything should be on the table\u201d when asked what parts of federal law enforcement need to be cut and referencedin the Catholic Church as an example of the kind of actions he believes need to change. Jordan has often argued, without much specificity, the best way to hold DOJ and FBI accountable is through \u201cthe power of the purse.\u201dSome House Republicans, however, are more specific about how to restrict certain activities or restructure certain components.Rep. Warren Davidson of Ohio, who acknowledged the role Trump has had in swaying members on this issue, told CNN he believes the problem \u201chas less to do with funding and more to do with structure,\u201d and floated an idea of using US Marshals to take over a lot of FBI\u2019s current responsibilities, with \u201can entirely different law enforcement entity\u201d taking over the bureau\u2019s international aspects.Rep. Chip Roy of Texas, who serves on the Judiciary Committee, told CNN he does not believe the FBI needs a new headquarters and said he would like federal law enforcement to focus less on domestic terrorism.\u201cI would like to take it back at a minimum to pre-9/11 to focus on crime and working with local and state jurisdictions to combat crime and not be so much dwelling on the domestic terrorism bit, which they exploited in ways that I don\u2019t think is particularly beneficial,\u201d he said.Roy was also one of 12 Republicans to send a letter, obtained by CNN, to the Committee on Appropriations in March requesting Congress \u201cprohibit funding\u201d for DOJ, which protects individuals obtaining an abortion as well as religious freedom.Twenty-eight House Republicans sent a separate March letter to the Appropriations subpanel that oversees DOJ funding, which was reviewed by CNN, calling for appropriators to prohibit the federal government from taking \u201cany discriminatory action\u201d against an individual who has the \u201csincerely held religious belief, or moral conviction that marriage is, or should be recognized as, a union of one man and one woman.\u201dAnother effort led by Rep. Jim Banks of Indiana to defund \u201cwoke programs\u201d and initiatives across the federal government has included letters to each of the 12 House Appropriations subcommittees in March, and calls for no more funding to certain programs within DOJ that target diversity, equity, inclusion and climate.Multiple Republicans told CNN that they are looking to Jordan\u2019s \u201cweaponization\u201d subcommittee to outline cuts for the Committee on Appropriations to carry out.Rep. Byron Donalds of Florida said the \u201cweaponization\u201d subcommittee must \u201cidentify and isolate\u201d what types of cuts to the DOJ and FBI need to be made for GOP appropriators to then \u201ctake a scalpel and cut them out.\u201dGOP Rep. Darrell Issa, who serves on Jordan\u2019s weaponization subcommittee, said the subpanel\u2019s job is to \u201cexpose\u201d parts of the DOJ and FBI he believes to be hurting freedom of speech for appropriators to take up.\u201cI think at a minimum, no funds may be used to do \u2018X\u2019 are likely to be either in the bill or in amendments, where we specifically deny them certain activities,\u201d the California Republican said. \u201cHowever, you know, nobody that I know of is talking about defunding these organizations, but defunding programs.\u201dAnother weaponization committee member, Rep. Dan Bishop, acknowledged to CNN that details of what should be defunded, restructured or decentralized still need to be worked out. But the North Carolina Republican said he intends to see reforms take effect \u201cif I do nothing else in Congress.\u201d\u201cThe FBI and the Department of Justice obviously require very substantial reform. Precisely what that is, we\u2019ll see,\u201d Bishop said.Republicans on the Appropriations committee receiving these requests also present a spectrum of opinions.Rep. Andrew Clyde of Georgia, who sits on the specific subcommittee that oversees DOJ\u2019s budget, told CNN, \u201cIt seems like that one of the few things that three letter agencies listen to is their budget.\u201dAnother one of those appropriators, Rep. Steve Womack of Arkansas \u2013 who said he saw some \u201cshortcomings\u201d from DOJ and FBI leadership, but offered support to rank-and-file agents \u2013 acknowledged of his Republican colleagues on the right, \u201cI will tell you, I know there are members of our conference that would like a pound of flesh.\u201dDespite increasing pressure, Appropriations Committee member GOP Rep. Dave Joyce of Ohio said that while things will \u201ctake a haircut\u201d as the result of the House GOP\u2019s proposal on the debt ceiling, \u201cin reality, I don\u2019t think there is ever going to be a blanket defund.\u201dLooking at the process from across the aisle, the top Democrat on Jordan\u2019s select subcommittee, Del. Stacey Plaskett of the US Virgin Islands, told CNN she is worried about the groundwork Republicans on the subcommittee are laying.\u201cI am concerned about them trying to outline through their conspiracy theories and others going down their rabbit holes that they are making an argument that the FBI is an enemy of the state,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m concerned about they\u2019re trying to fracture rule of law here in the country.\u201d"

Justin Wilmeth, who described the race as \u201cthe Wild, Wild West.\u201dSinema, who was elected to the Senate, became an independent in December, though she continues to caucus with her former party colleagues in the chamber. She has not yet said whether she will seek a second term in 2024.But her broken ties with Democratic voters and groups that once backed her was on display Wednesday at what was billed as a \u201cSinema Sold Out\u201d rally at the Arizona Capitol in Phoenix.Carrying a papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 pig as a prop to describe what they called Sinema\u2019s courting of rich donors, members of progressive groups representing labor, immigrants and veterans called on the former Democrat to resign. Nearly all of the groups had organized and canvassed voters in the Arizona heat to elect Sinema in 2018. None of the group members CNN spoke with said they would support her again.\u201cWe\u2019re going to work to elect a new senator who does a far better job of representing Arizona,\u201d said Alex Alvarez, executive director of Progress Arizona. \u201cIt\u2019s time for Kyrsten Sinema to step aside. It\u2019s become clear that Arizonans do not want her to run again.\u201dThe contours of Arizona\u2019s Senate race could take longer than other high-profile 2024 contests to develop. Arizona\u2019s filing deadline is next April, and the state\u2019s primaries aren\u2019t until August next year.Pinal County Sheriffto enter the race. His campaign declined an interview request.

Also in the mix could be GOP businessman Jim Lamon, who lost the party nod for the state\u2019s other Senate seat last year.For now, though, Republicans in Arizona, after losing Senate races the, say they are glad the drama is on the other side at the moment.\u201cI mean, I\u2019m a politician, man. I\u2019m a Republican,\u201d said Wilmeth, the state lawmaker. \u201cAnd knowing that your opponent is having problems getting to the line of scrimmage and executing their plays is good for me.\u201dProgressives have largely rallied behind. The five-term Phoenix-area congressman and Iraq War veteran, nearly $3.8 million to $2.1 million, in 2023\u2019s first quarter that ended March 31, Federal Election Commission filings show. But Sinema still held a significant cash advantage, with about $10 million in the bank to her opponent\u2019s $2.7 million.Gallego has been sharply critical of the senator, casting her as beholden to lobbyists and business interests and arguing she has lost touch with Arizona since herover Republican Martha McSally in 2018.\u201cShe broke trust with a lot of the people of Arizona. They don\u2019t trust her values anymore, and she\u2019s not trying to repair that relationship,\u201d Gallego said in an interview.Sinema\u2019s office declined an interview request. \u201cKyrsten is focused on delivering real solutions, not campaign politics,\u201d press secretary Pablo Sierra-Carmona said in a statement.A Sinema reelection bid as an independent is far from the only potential landscape-altering development ahead of Arizona\u2019s 2024 election, though.No Labels, the business-aligned centrist group, has gained ballot access in several states. The organization has described its effort as an insurance policy if the national parties offer unacceptable presidential candidates, but Democrats in Arizona fear the group could align with Sinema in the Senate race.Arizona Secretary of State Adrian Fontes, a Democrat, in March recognized the \u201cNo Labels Party\u201d as having gained ballot access in the state after meeting the minimum requirements.The Arizona Democratic Partyin Maricopa County court in late March, seeking to reverse No Labels\u2019 recognition as a political party. No Labels is registered as a nonprofit and does not disclose its donors \u2013 which the state party argued means it does not meet the requirements for a political party, including disclosing donors, registering with the FEC and following contribution limits.Meanwhile, a group of Arizona political veterans have launched Save Democracy Arizona, which advocates open primaries and\u2013 a process that proponents say would give candidates incentives to appeal to moderate voters, rather than their parties\u2019 extremes. But as supporters work to place a ranked choice initiative on the ballot next year, Republican state lawmakers are looking to advance their own ballot measure that would prohibit any experiments with the voting method.While Sinema has touted herself as an \u201cindependent voice\u201d for a statebetween Republican, Democratic and unaffiliated voters, she could face a challenge attracting independent support if she runs for reelection.At a monthly meeting this week in Mesa, a group of frustrated independent voters gathered to begin organizing the petition process for ranked-choice voting. Some were supportive of Sinema. But others, like Becky Wyatt, who maintains her Democratic registration while identifying as an independent voter, said she felt the senator was inaccessible to Arizona voters.\u201cI gave her money. I gave money on behalf of my parents for their Christmas presents in support of her,\u201d Wyatt said. \u201cAnd she is dead to me.\u201dOther members of the group said they felt Sinema had misled voters.\u201cRunning for one party and then turning around right when you\u2019re done and switching to independent? That\u2019s just wrong. So she doesn\u2019t have my support,\u201d said Brady Busby, an independent who attended the meeting.Another independent, C.J. Diegel, said: \u201cShe just makes a lot of people angry who are responsible for her electoral future.\u201dClint Smith, who got 6% of the vote last year running for a deep-red US House seat outside Phoenix, said winning as an independent would be a daunting challenge despite Sinema\u2019s huge advantages in cash on hand and name recognition.\u201cI feel like people retreat to their corners when push comes to shove,\u201d he said."

        "text": "Montana Republican Gov. Greg Gianforte signed on Wednesday a collection of bills restricting, triggering legal action and challenging a 1999 state Supreme Court ruling on the procedure.While abortion remains legal in Montana,specifies that access to the procedure until viability is no longer protected under the right of privacy in the state\u2019s constitution \u2013 contradicting the court\u2019s two decades old ruling.\u201cFor years in Montana, abortion activists have used the cloak of a shaky legal interpretation to advance their pro-abortion agenda. That stops today,\u201d GianforteWednesday, describing the new laws as \u201cgiving a voice to the voiceless.\u201dThe restrictions come as states navigate a new abortion landscape in the wake of the US Supreme Court\u2019s reversal of Roe v. Wade last year, which removed federal abortion protections. Several Republican-led states have enacted restrictions, while some Democratic-led states have passed legislation expanding access to their residents and those seeking care from other states.See where abortions are banned and legal \u2014 and where it's still in limboOne of the new laws Gianforte signed Wednesday establishes athat allows health care providers or institutions to refuse to perform abortions if it violates their \u201cethical, moral, or religious beliefs or principles.\u201dAnother bill,, signed by Gianforte Wednesday, requires health care providers, in the rare case a baby is born alive after an attempted abortion, to give care to the infant or face fines and imprisonment. However, it is already considered homicide in the US to intentionally kill an infant that is born alive.While Gianforte said that the slate of \u201cpro-family, pro-child, pro-life bills will make a lasting difference in Montana,\u201d Democrats and abortion rights advocates argue that the new laws add \u201cunnecessary\u201d provisions to restrict access.Abortion rights advocates secured a preliminary victory Thursday, with a Montana judge temporarily blocking one measure,, that would require a patient to have an ultrasound and get a written determination of viability from a provider in order to get an abortion.The state\u2019s Planned Parenthood chapter had filed anWednesday after the provision took effect, arguing that requiring an ultrasound before a procedure effectively bans telehealth medication abortion.since the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling on abortion last summer.\u201cInstead of trusting us to make our own decisions about our bodies and lives, Montana lawmakers are once again forcing their way into our exam rooms and blocking our access to essential health care,\u201d said Martha Fuller, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood of Montana.\u201cBy adding unnecessary and burdensome red tape to a safe and legal medical procedure, these politicians have made clear that it was never about our health and safety,\u201d Fuller said in a statement Wednesday. \u201cIt was always about undermining our personal freedom and shaming people who seek abortions.\u201dThis move is one of several legal battles related to reproductive rights playing out in state and federal courts. Near-total abortion bans inandremain in limbo after judges issued orders halting the restrictions."

        "text": "Editor\u2019s Note:A version of this article first appeared in the \u201cReliable Sources\u201d newsletter.It\u2019s a script without an ending.Since the Writers Guild of AmericaTuesday after failing to hammer out a deal with the major studios, all of which are represented by the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, the two sides have been at an absolute standstill.I\u2019m told that there have been no negotiations since the strike commenced and that there are no negotiating sessions currently on the books. When I asked a studio executive on Wednesday evening when they expect talks to resume, the person replied, \u201cNo idea, no idea.\u201d\u201cThere is no way of knowing,\u201d the executive added.Both sides have dug their heels in the sand over a small number of significant issues, and neither side is willing to budge at the moment. It is, after all, impossible to negotiate until a non-negotiable condition for one party becomes a negotiable.What the executive I spoke to did underscore is that the studios have plenty of content in the bank to keep their hungry audiences happy. And in recent years, the executive pointed out, viewers have actually struggled to keep up with all the new shows and movies that have been released on streaming platforms.\u201cWe are not going to have test patterns on any TV any time soon,\u201d the executive joked, noting that streaming catalogs are filled to the brim with shows and movies for people to watch.How a writers' strike might affect your favorite TV showsThe executive is not wrong. Outside of fans of the venerable late-night comedy institutions, it is going to take quite a while for the average viewer to see the impacts of the ongoing strike. Think for a minute: Has the strike impacted your television viewing habits yet? I\u2019m betting not.In other words, the standoff will likely have to endure for a lengthy period until it becomes unbearable for either side. And it just might.The WGA has signaled that the work stoppage could last for many months. And if the guild wants to apply real pressure to the studios, it\u2019s hard to see how it would not push the strike deep into the summer.Which is all to say, strap yourself in for the long haul."

So far, she is unbothered by it all.\u201cAge is just a number,\u201d said Harris, a loyal Democrat and longtime civic leader here in western Michigan. \u201cUntil God takes him home, he has the strength right now to do what he needs to be doing for the country.\u201dYet that does not mean she is particularly enthusiastic about the road ahead or doesn\u2019t wish voters would be given choices beyond Biden, 80, and a potential rematch with former President, 76.\u201cDo I get excited? No!\u201d she said. \u201cI just think of, again, all that craziness.\u201dA week after declaring his bid for reelection, a wave of new Biden campaign ads touting his accomplishments are already airing in Michigan as the president works to elevate his standing among Democrats and independents who backed him four years ago.Khara DeWit, a small businesswoman who opened South East Market two years ago to bring fresh groceries to an underserved Grand Rapids neighborhood, exhaled when asked about the next presidential race and whether she intended to cast her vote once again for Biden.\u201cI personally only voted for him as a way to debunk Trump,\u201d said DeWit, who fondly recalls seeing Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, her preferred candidate, on a visit here before the Michigan primary in 2020. \u201cBut I really thought our democracy was in jeopardy and I wanted someone else.\u201dFor more than two years, she has watched Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris and is not displeased with their record or governing style.Of the president, she said: \u201cHe is about getting the job done.\u201d Of the vice president: \u201cI was really pleased she was elected. She needs more of a platform.\u201dA tone of respectful reluctance toward Biden comes alive in interviews with many voters here, but DeWit and others expressing some points of skepticism said they had little hesitation at the notion of supporting the ticket again.Asked whether she would be motivated to cast a ballot for Biden or one against Trump, should he become the Republican nominee, DeWit didn\u2019t hesitate, saying: \u201cTrump is the motivator. How do we make sure he doesn\u2019t get elected?\u201dEven as the Republican primary race is still taking shape, Trump dominates the political conversation \u2013 among Democrats and Republicans \u2013 in Grand Rapids and surrounding Kent County, which he lost in 2020 after winning four years earlier. Once again, this western swath of the state will be among the most competitive pieces of terrain in battleground Michigan.Terry Almquist, a retired professor, said he understands myriad questions about health, stamina and age that are an undercurrent to the doubts a majority of Americans have about the president running again.If elected, Biden would be 82 when taking the oath of office and 86 by the end of his term, setting new records for an American leader.\u201cIt will be an issue to a lot of people. I don\u2019t think it should be, but I think it will be,\u201d Almquist said. \u201cBut what can I say, I\u2019m 80 years old myself, so he\u2019s one of my people.\u201dA tepid sense of excitement for Biden is palpable in conversations with many people who supported him, like Sarah Laman, who opened Last Mile Coffee in Grand Rapids during the pandemic. She said she has mixed feelings toward the Biden administration as she tries to keep her business on track during high inflation.\u201cJust because somebody has my vote,\u201d Laman said, \u201cdoesn\u2019t necessarily mean I\u2019m a massive advocate of them.\u201dAsked whether she intended to vote for Biden again, she paused for a moment and finally said: \u201cI don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know.\u201dShe lamented the limited choices for voters and wondered aloud if a third-party candidate could find an enthusiastic reception or simply be a spoiler, saying: \u201cI have not voted third-party in a presidential election before, but maybe I would be inspired to.\u201dAt this early stage of the presidential race, her sentiment helps frame pivotal questions of the 2024 campaign: Can Trump exhaustion lead to Biden enthusiasm? Could that enthusiasm be fleeting if the president faces a new opponent \u2013 or two \u2013 next year?Nancy Wagner, a retiree and political independent, said she voted for Trump in 2020. But she recoils at the thought of a rematch with Biden.\u201cI think it sounds awful,\u201d Wagner said, stopping to chat after attending a town meeting with her congresswoman, Hillary Scholten, on Tuesday evening. \u201cWe need a new generation of leaders. We need people with fresh ideas.\u201dWagner addresses a quiet concern among some Democrats, too, that Biden may be well-positioned to confront Trump, but may not be the right man for the job if the Republican nominee is someone else who can mount a generational argument for change.Scholten, who last fall became the first Democrat to represent western Michigan in three decades, believes her party must better explain its accomplishments. From the landmark infrastructure law to the investments made to create jobs in the Inflation Reduction Act, Scholten said her constituents aren\u2019t always aware of the Biden administration achievements.\u201cI look at the approval ratings. We all know there is still some dissatisfaction with national Democrats, despite everything they have delivered on in the last two years,\u201d Scholten told CNN. \u201cIt\u2019s not an everyday reality for people just yet. These large major improvements are going to take time to come through.\u201dThat sentiment underscores a central challenge facing the White House: touting the administration\u2019s record without assuming that all Americans can feel or appreciate the benefits.Driving across Grand Rapids, signs of those accomplishments come into sharper view, like major road construction projects along Eastern Avenue or Interstate 96 or the major expansion of a terminal at the Gerald R. Ford International Airport.\u201cI think the president is not getting the credit for what he has done. We need so much more in the way of infrastructure,\u201d said Almquist, the retired professor. \u201cWe\u2019re just scratching the surface.\u201dAlmquist said he voted for Biden without hesitation last time, but acknowledges he wasn\u2019t sure how the longtime senator and former vice president would fare in the Oval Office. After watching the president for more than two years, he now believes those doubts were misplaced.\u201cI knew he was a competent person, but I didn\u2019t know how he would present himself on the main stage,\u201d Almquist said. \u201cI must admit, I was wrong. I think he\u2019s handled the whole situation very well.\u201d"

In both cases, the publisher won at the lower court level, and those decisions stood.ProPublica: GOP megadonor paid private school tuition for grandnephew of Justice Clarence ThomasLiberalwho joined the court in 2009 and has been paid millions of dollars from the publisher over the years, declined to recuse herself in all three instances.Conservativewho joined the court in 2017 and also has received hundreds of thousands of dollars in book deals with the publisher, declined to disqualify himself from the more recent case when it came before the court for consideration.The justices\u2019 actions were earlier reported bya watchdog group that presses for more transparency from the judiciary, andThe Supreme Court has come under intense scrutiny in recent weeks followingamong some justices related toWatchdog groups have been especially focused on the court\u2019s recusal practices, an area they say is ripe for reform given that no mechanism exists for ensuring a justice won\u2019t participate in a case in which they might have a conflict.The Supreme Court did not respond for comment.The court does not typically say publicly how a justice voted in a decision over whether to take up an appeal, but it does briefly note when a recusal has occurred.In both cases, former liberal Justice Stephen Breyer, who also has received book royalties from the publisher, recused himself.Gabe Roth, executive director of Fix the Court, told CNN that the federal law concerning recusal has long been interpreted as applying to stock ownership on the part of the justice or a close family member.Roth said that Breyer, who retired in 2022, likely recused himself from the cases because he owns stock in a company that for a time had a large stake in Penguin.For her part, Sotomayor, who is currently the court\u2019s senior liberal, has published several books since joining the bench, including a few children\u2019s books and a memoir, \u201cMy Beloved World,\u201d which was published in 2013 by Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group. The group is part of the publishing conglomerate Penguin Random House.In financial disclosure forms for 2010 and 2012, Sotomayor reported receiving book advances from Knopf Doubleday that totaled $3.1 million. Her disclosure forms for the years 2017 through 2021 show that the company has paid her nearly $500,000 in book royalties and advances during that period. The disclosures for 2022 are not yet available.Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson set to publish 'Lovely One' memoirGorsuch published \u201cA Republic, If You Can Keep It\u201d in 2019 through Penguin. The justice has received a total of $655,000 from the publishing conglomerate in recent years, according to his 2018, 2019 and 2020 disclosures.Roth, whose group has for years kept track of instances in which justices should have recused themselves from a case, said he could not point to other examples where a justice should have disqualified him or herself from a case concerning their book publisher.Roth noted that Justices Amy Coney Barrett and Ketanji Brown Jackson also have books in the works.\u201cI think these entities should be added to the justices\u2019 recusal sheets, and they should not participate in petitions involving their book publishers that are very clearly enriching them,\u201d Roth said.When it comes to recusals, the standards for recusal at the high court are necessarily more restrictive because the Supreme Court allows only its own members to hear a dispute \u2013 unlike the lower courts that can freely substitute one district or circuit court judge for another.In alast month by all nine current members of the court that they said was meant to provide \u201cclarity\u201d to the public their ethics practices, the justices explained why individual jurists \u201crather than the Court\u201d must decide recusal issues.\u201cIf the full Court or any subset of the Court were to review the recusal decisions of individual Justices, it would create an undesirable situation in which the Court could affect the outcome of a case by selecting who among its Members may participate,\u201d they said in the statement.CNN\u2019s Joan Biskupic and Ariane de Vogue contributed to this report."

        "text": "Throughout this year\u2019s session, the Republican-controlled Florida legislature has pushed through several pieces of legislation that are considered big policy wins for GOP Gov..As the session came to a close Friday \u2013 and as thebegins \u2013 here\u2019s a breakdown of the key bills DeSantis has already signed and a look ahead at the measures, ushered through by the legislature\u2019s Republican supermajority, that await his signature.A measure dubbed the, signed by DeSantislast month, prohibits physicians from knowingly performing abortions after six weeks in most cases.Exceptions for rape, incest and human trafficking exist for up to 15 weeks into a pregnancy, but there is a caveat: Women \u201cmust provide a copy of a restraining order, police report, medical record, or other court order or documentation providing evidence.\u201d Additionally, after six weeks, two physicians can certify in writing that the abortion is necessary to save the woman\u2019s life or to \u201cavert a serious risk of substantial and irreversible physical impairment of a major bodily function.\u201dAt a March news conference, DeSantis called the proposed exceptions \u201csensible.\u201dThough enacted, the six-week ban won\u2019t take effect until 30 days after the state Supreme Court either overturns its previous precedent on abortion or tosses out cases from Planned Parenthood and abortion rights activists challenging the existing 15-week abortion ban.In April, DeSantis unceremoniously signedauthorizingin Florida.Under the law, which will take effect July 1, gun owners are allowed to carry a gun in public without a government-issued permit.\u201cYou don\u2019t need a permission slip from the government to be able to exercise your constitutional rights,\u201d DeSantis said at a March event to promoteat a gun store in Georgia.The law also ends an existing state requirement to undergo training before carrying a concealed weapon outside the home.The government-issued permit remains available for those who wish to obtain one. And it would remain illegal to carry a firearm in certain gun-free zones, including schools, courthouses and college campuses.Some gun rights advocates have said that the law doesn\u2019t go far enough, while Florida Democrats have criticized DeSantis for signing the public safety bill, arguing that it achieves the opposite.DeSantis in April signed a bill thatfor the death penalty, making Florida the state with the lowest threshold for administering capital punishment.Under, \u201cif at least eight jurors determine that the defendant should be sentenced to death, the jury\u2019s recommendation to the court must be a sentence of death.\u201dIf fewer than eight jurors recommend the death penalty, the law requires the court to impose a sentence of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole.\u201dIn January, DeSantis vowed to rid Florida of unanimous 12-member jury decisions for the death penalty, citing theas a miscarriage of justice. The shooter was sentenced to life in prison without parole rather than death, due to three jurors recommending against the death penalty.\u201cToday\u2019s change in Florida law will hopefully save other families from the injustices we have suffered,\u201d said Ryan Petty, whose daughter Alaina was killed in the Parkland shooting.On Monday, DeSantis signed a bill that makes child rapistswith the minimum sentence of life in prison without parole.According to, \u201ca person 18 years of age or older who commits sexual battery upon, or in an attempt to commit sexual battery injures the sexual organs of, a person less than 12 years of age commits a capital felony.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re putting pedophiles to death, hopefully,\u201d DeSantis said, before sitting down to sign the bill in Titusville, Florida.The law runs afoul of a 2008 US Supreme Court decision prohibiting states from applying the death penalty for child rape if the victim did not die.\u201cWe think that in the worst of the worst cases, the only appropriate punishment is the ultimate punishment, and so this bill sets up a procedure to be able to challenge that precedent,\u201d DeSantis said Monday.DeSantis signedTuesday that expands upon measures to block Florida investments based on environmental, social and governance, or ESG, factors while threatening banks and other financial institutions with sanctions if they deny business to people due to moral or political objections.\u201cESG is officially DOA in the state of Florida,\u201d DeSantis said as he signed the bill in Jacksonville.The new law codifies a measure approved last year by the State Board of Administration, which oversees pensions, that prohibits state retirement fund managers from making investment decisions based on reasons other than maximizing the highest rate of return.\u201cIt takes what we did last year with Florida\u2019s Pension Fund, and it codifies into law the idea that the fiduciary obligation is to produce the best returns possible for the beneficiaries, not to be diverted in that task by pursuing these ideological agendas,\u201d DeSantis said.Under the law, financial institutions, including banks, credit unions and other lenders, face fines if they refuse to lend to people for reasons other than \u201can analysis of risk factors unique to each current or prospective customer.\u201d Under the law, banks that operate in Florida could face punishment if they refuse to lend to gun manufacturers, fossil fuel companies or certain far-right groups.More bills await DeSantis\u2019 signature.Disney will be subject to new measures heading to the governor\u2019s desk, as tensions have escalated in recent weeks withbetween the entertainment giant and DeSantis\u2019 handpicked board to oversee Disney\u2019s special taxing district.Under one measure, the state would take over safety inspections in \u201cany governmentally or privately owned fixed-guideway transportation systems operating in this state which are located within an independent special district created by local act which have boundaries within two contiguous counties.\u201dThis would apply to just one transportation system in the state: Disney World\u2019s monorail, which crosses over Orange and Osceola counties.Lawmakers also gave final approval on Thursday to a bill that would allow an appointed board to review and void previous land agreements in the state \u2013 a win for the governor in his feud with Disney. DeSantis signed the bill Friday afternoon, after the legislative session ended.Ahead of a state takeover of Disney\u2019s special taxing district, the companywith an outgoing board to shift much of the power in the district to Disney. DeSantis and his appointees on the new boardthose agreements. This is another tool to potentially void the agreements.Another measure would expand Florida\u2019s ban on instruction about sexual orientation and gender identity from prekindergarten through grade 8, rather than kindergarten through grade 3. The state\u2019s education boardteaching students about sexual orientation and gender identity through high school.Last year\u2019s Parental Rights in Education Act, which opponents have dubbed, contained the original ban and is at thebetween DeSantis and Disney. Additionally, the new measure would prevent teachers and staff at public schools from using their preferred pronouns when talking to students.Also awaiting DeSantis\u2019 signature is a sweeping, which includesthat would allow the governor to run for president without resigning, as he prepares for an expected White House bid.The elections bill would also have larger implications by placingand third-party registration groups.Other legislation awaiting DeSantis\u2019 signature would change the lives ofin Florida.The bills would prohibit transgender children from receiving gender-affirming treatments and ban transgender people from using a bathroom in a government building that does not match their biological sex.CNN\u2019s Fredreka Schouten and Sydney Kashiwagi contributed to this story."

We have all benefited from her service and dedication to public health, and I wish her the best in her next chapter,\u201d Biden said.Walensky said in a letter to Biden that the agency \u201csaved and improved lives and protected the country and the world from the greatest infectious disease threat we have seen in over 100 years.\u201d\u201cThe end of the COVID-19 public health emergency marks a tremendous transition for our country, for public health, and in my tenure as CDC Director,\u201d she wrote. \u201cI took on this role, at your request, with the goal of leaving behind the dark days of the pandemic and moving CDC \u2013 and public health \u2013 forward into a much better and more trusted place.\u201dBeyond the Covid-19 pandemic, the CDC under Walensky also responded to health crises such as outbreaks of Ebola in Uganda and mpox in nations around the world.CDC announces sweeping reorganization, aimed at changing the agency's culture and restoring public trust\u201cRochelle Walensky has been an extraordinary leader and a terrific partner,\u201d Dr. Ashish Jha, the White House\u2019s Covid-19 response team leader, said Friday on. \u201cShe has done the critical work of launching major reforms to ensure we have an even more effective CDC.\u201dLast year, after acknowledging missteps in its response to Covid-19, the CDC underwent an independent review of those efforts as well as close examinations of its operations. In August, Walensky laid out a sweeping plan to overhaul how the agency works and remake the culture so it can respond more quickly to health problems.\u201cMy goal is a new, public health action-oriented culture at CDC that emphasizes accountability, collaboration, communication, and timeliness,\u201d she said in a statement at the time.Part of Walensky\u2019s plan involved asking Congress for new flexibilities in funding and new powers such as mandates that jurisdictions share health data.\u201cChanges are under way on everything from expanding the number of staff who are ready to respond to a disease outbreak to the implementation of plain language trainings to the overhaul of CDC\u2019s website, so that it\u2019s easier for people to find the public health information they need,\u201d Friday\u2019s CDC statement notes.High hopes but tempered expectations as CDC launches review of agency's structure and systems\u201cWhile at CDC, I had the true gift of meeting, working with, and giving voice to thousands of people at the agency who work 24/7 to worry about health and public health so that the rest of the nation does not have to,\u201d Walensky said in the statement. \u201cI have never been prouder of anything I have done in my professional career.\u201dBefore joining the CDC, Walensky was chief of the Division of Infectious Diseases at Massachusetts General Hospital and a professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School.

No one was more empathetic on national television than she was. You could see the pain that we were all suffering during this pandemic on her face. We were lucky to have Dr. Walensky.

        "text": "The White House on Thursday expressed openness to a short-term fix to the debt ceiling as the US barrels toward a June default with the full faith and credit of the US government in the balance.\u201cCongressional leaders are going to have to figure out a way to do this. Of course, I\u2019m sure there\u2019ll be conversations about the length. You saw the length in the congressional Republicans\u2019 bill that would take us into this situation again this time next year,\u201d Office of Management and Budget Director Shalanda Young told reporters Thursday at the White House.\u201cI\u2019m sure one of the things on the table we will have to work through is how long? I\u2019m not going to take anything off the table. The important thing to do is to make sure we do this and leave the drama behind regardless of what length we end up in,\u201d she added.Asked whether President Joe Biden would sign a bill that would raise the debt limit for a shorter period of time, Young indicated it would be a positive sign for the negotiations, but said they are not there yet.\u201cAt least that part of the conversation about length \u2013 I would love to be in that part of the conversation. Because we\u2019re at least in the positive: default is off the table. So I\u2019m happy when we get to that part of the conversation. We\u2019re not there yet. And the idea is to put brinksmanship to bed and get to talking on making sure we avoid default. And once we\u2019re talking about timeframe, that means we\u2019re at least on the right side of this debate,\u201d she said.Young\u2019s comments come ahead of a high-stakes meeting with congressional leaders at the White House set for Tuesday. Republicans have repeatedly advocated for spending cuts tied to the debt ceiling while the White House has emphatically maintained it will not negotiate on the matter.The White House later sought to clarify Young\u2019s comments, telling CNN that she was not explicitly making an endorsement of a short-term increase.A White House official said Friday that Young \u201cwasn\u2019t endorsing a short-term increase, she was making clear we welcome a conversation about how long to increase the debt ceiling instead of whether to increase it.\u201dAnd later Friday, the official offered a statement more strongly walking back any openness to a short-term fix: \u201cWe are not weighing a short-term extension. We are focused on removing the threat of default which will erase our economic progress,\u201d a White House official told CNN nearly 24 hours after Young appeared in the briefing room.Pressed on whether the president could invoke the 14th Amendment, which gives a president an unprecedentedly expansive view of executive power with regard to raising the debt ceiling, she reiterated: \u201cIt is Congress\u2019 duty to ensure we don\u2019t default.\u201dAsked once more, she said: \u201cWe continue to have the position that this is Congress\u2019 duty to do.\u201dYoung warned against a default, which she said is both \u201ccatastrophic\u201d for the economy but would also \u201c(set) us on a road to be ineffective in the appropriations process.\u201dThe White House has warned against dire and devastating effects the economy should the US default, including the possibility of an \u201cimmediate, sharp recession\u201d and the loss of up to 8 million jobs.\u201cOf course we\u2019re concerned. We\u2019re calling on the reasonable people in this town to do the right thing,\u201d Young said Thursday.She continued, \u201cCongress can put a bill on the floor tomorrow, avoid default. The DC drama, the political brinksmanship. That\u2019s what that is. Nothing is preventing Congress from moving to avoid default. And they need to do that, whether it\u2019s tomorrow or next week.\u201d"

        "text": "House Oversight Chairman James Comer is once again taking aim at President Joe Biden\u2019s retention of classified documents, demanding a transcribed interview and documents from former White House Counsel Dana Remus, the committee announced Friday.\u201cThe Committee has learned that you were a central figure in the early stages of coordinating the packing and moving of boxes that were later found to contain classified materials,\u201d Comer wrote in a letter to Remus. \u201cThe President\u2019s haphazard handling of classified materials raises many additional questions about the repercussions of these actions, including possible threats to national security.\u201dComer said he wants more details about why Remus tasked Kathy Chung, Biden\u2019s former executive assistant, with packing up Biden\u2019s office at the Penn Biden Center, even though Chung was no longer working as Biden\u2019s assistant. Remus did not immediately respond to a request for comment.The letter included snippets of Chung\u2019s testimony, in which she told the committee that when she packed 13 boxes for Biden in June 2022, the boxes were not put in a locked closet.In an earlier statement, Richard Sauber, special counsel to President Biden said the classified documents \u201cwere discovered when the president\u2019s personal attorneys were packing files housed in a locked closet to prepare to vacate office space at the Penn Biden Center,\u201d in November 2022.According to a source familiar with Chung\u2019s testimony, Chung was read Sauber\u2019s statement during her transcribed interview and she said she had no reason to believe that statement was untrue.It is not clear whether those files were part of the documents Chung packed in June or whether Biden\u2019s personal attorneys discovered additional files in November.The White House declined to comment, citing the ongoing special counsel investigation. In January, Attorney General Merrick Garlandto take over the investigation into Obama-era classified documents found at Biden\u2019s home and former private office.that Chung told the committee she was not aware there were classified documents in the boxes she packed for Biden.Excerpts from Chung\u2019s interview with the committee also reveal that she was surprised that the boxes she packed up at the Penn Biden Center in June 2022 still had not been picked up in October 2022. In excerpts of Chung\u2019s interview released by Democrats on the committee earlier this week, there was no mention of Chung inquiring why the boxes she packed up in June still had not been picked up in October.According to emails Chung shared with the panel that were revealed Friday, a Penn Biden Center employee emailed Chung on October 4, 2022, telling her that the boxes she packed up at the Penn Biden Center on June 28, 2022, still had not been picked up.Chung wrote back, \u201cwait. Did they not pick up back in June,\u201d and told the panel in her interview that she was surprised by this.On October 13, 2022, Chung notified Biden\u2019s personal attorney, Bob Bauer, that the boxes still remained at the Penn Biden Center. Bauer texted Chung back to say that a former personal attorney for Biden, Patrick Moore, was going through the boxes. As CNN, Moore made the initial discovery of classified material while packing up Biden\u2019s former think tank office, and has spoken to federal investigators in the initial review of Biden\u2019s handling of classified documents.\u201cSo we should get this organized in the near future,\u201d Bauer said in the text to Chung.Chung also acknowledged in her interview that Hunter Biden, the president\u2019s son, had asked if she was interested in serving as assistant to then-Vice President Biden back in 2012. Chung and Hunter Biden had previously worked together.\u201cHunter Biden called me and asked me if I was interested in the position,\u201d Chung told the committee.Chung\u2019s attorney has previously criticized Comer for how he has characterized Chung\u2019s hiring.\u201cFor you to say she got the job \u2018to help with the Biden family moving documents at the recommendation of Hunter Biden; and further that you expect to pursue some bizarre notion that Hunter Biden recommended her because of a purported interest in documents indicates to us the real possibility that you do not intend to treat Ms. Chung fairly,\u201d Chung\u2019s lawyer told Comer in a March letter, previously reported by CNN."

        "text": "is trying to move the New York criminal case regarding hush money payments to adult film star Stormy Daniels to federal court, saying the Manhattan district attorney\u2019s charges are tied to Trump\u2019s duties as president.In aThursday, Trump\u2019s lawyers also hinted at how they may defend the former president, arguing that the reimbursement payments made to then-personal attorney Michael Cohen were not falsified business records.E. Jean Carroll and Donald Trump rest their cases in civil rape trial, but Trump could still testify\u201cThis case is unprecedented in our nation\u2019s history,\u201d the filing states. \u201cNever before has a local elected prosecutor criminally prosecuted a defendant either for conduct that occurred entirely while the defendant was the sitting President of the United States or for conduct that related to federal campaign contribution laws.Prosecutors allege that Trump falsified business records when he repaid Cohen for hush money payments made during the 2016 campaign to women who claimed they had extramarital affairs with Trump, which he denies. Prosecutors allege the intent was to conceal criminal conduct that hid damaging information about Trump during the election. Trump pleaded not guilty to all charges last month.In Thursday\u2019s filing, Trump\u2019s attorneys wrote that the former president \u201cdenies these were false records.\u201dTrump \u201cwill assert that the statements in the purported business records at issue were in fact truthful statements because the money paid to Michael Cohen was, in part, \u2018retainer\u2019 or legal payments to Michael Cohen to act as President Trump\u2019s personal attorney.\u201dThe district attorney\u2019s office said in a statement, \u201cWe are reviewing the notice of removal and will file an appropriate response in court.\u201dThe motion from Trump\u2019s legal team has been assigned to district Judge Alvin Hellerstein, an appointee of former President Bill Clinton.Trump attorney Todd Blanche told New Yorkduring the tail end of a procedural hearing Thursday that Trump\u2019s legal team would file the motion to move the case, in what appears to be a bid to try to undercutcase against Trump.Still, the move could add another issue that would need to be litigated ahead of a trial next year.Elie Honig, a CNN senior legal analyst and former federal and state prosecutor, said the move from Trump\u2019s lawyers was unlikely to succeed.\u201cWhile Trump can seek to remove a state-level criminal charge to federal court, he\u2019d have to establish that the conduct somehow involved his performance of his official duties as president, which seems unlikely given that the hush money payments related to his pre-presidency candidacy,\u201d Honig said.In their argument to move the case, Trump\u2019s attorneys wrote that Cohen was hired as Trump\u2019s personal lawyer to manage Trump\u2019s finances while he was president \u201cin order to separate his business affairs from his public duties.\u201dE. Jean Carroll sounded 'breathless' and 'emotional' in call after alleged rape, friend testifies\u201cPresident Trump\u2019s decision to retain Michael Cohen to act as his personal lawyer arose out of his duties as President and therefore gives rise to a federal defense to the charges in this case,\u201d Trump\u2019s lawyers wrote.Cohen, who worked for Trump for years and was charged in 2018 with tax crimes, is a key witness for the prosecution.In the filing, Trump\u2019s lawyers also argued that prosecutors are trying to prosecute Trump based on a \u201cnovel theory\u201d that Trump committed a felony under New York law by concealing a crime related to a federal election.\u201cThere are serious federal preemption issues with such a prosecution,\u201d Trump\u2019s lawyers wrote.Merchan told the district attorney\u2019s office and Trump\u2019s lawyers on Thursday he wanted them to decide on a trial date sometime in either February or March 2024, which would mean that the trial would occur in the midst of the 2024 Republican presidential primary.Once the date is set, Merchan cautioned, the attorneys involved \u2013 and Trump himself \u2013 could not agree to any engagements that could delay the trial.Thursday\u2019s hearing was the first since Trump appeared in court for his arraignment last month. Merchan tried to iron out disputes between the two sides over a protective order that would limit Trump\u2019s ability to publicize information about evidence from the investigation.Former Vice President Pence testifies to federal grand jury investigating Donald Trump and January 6Merchan indicated Thursday that he intended to keep in place the bulk of a protective order proposed by the district attorney\u2019s office, saying that limiting Trump\u2019s ability to speak about evidence turned over by prosecutors in the discovery process would not restrict his ability to talk about the case or defend himself as he runs for president in 2024.\u201cThis is not a gag order,\u201d Merchan said.Trump\u2019s lawyers objected to language in the protective order limiting what he could say about the case, arguing that his First Amendment rights should not be restricted as he campaigns for president in 2024.The district attorney\u2019s office responded that Trump has a \u201can extensive history of making inflammatory remarks\u201d about those who are investigating him \u2013 including Bragg \u2013 and said that Trump would not be restricted from discussing facts already in the public record.Trump\u2019s attorneys also objected to the district attorney\u2019s proposed restrictions that would limit the evidence that could be shared directly with Trump from witness cell phones included in the evidence, such as former Trump attorney and fixer Michael Cohen, a key prosecution witness.Notable legal clouds that continue to hang over Donald Trump in 2023Merchan went line by line through the language with the lawyers to try to find middle ground on how personal material from cell phones would remain walled off, while evidence relevant to the case could be shared. The judge urged prosecutors and the defense attorneys to hash out compromise language.Once the language for the protective order is finalized, Merchan agreed that Trump, as the defendant, should be told about its contents on the record. The defense attorneys and district attorney\u2019s office agreed that could be done virtually at a future court hearing, in order to avoid the massive police presence that was required in lower Manhattan for Trump\u2019s initial court appearance last month."

Justice Neil Gorsuch did not participate in Friday\u2019s ruling.2 weeks before his 9th scheduled execution, Richard Glossip hopes his fate 'can never happen to anybody else again'Glossip has maintained his innocence, having been convicted in 1998 of capital murder for ordering the killing of his boss.A review launched by Oklahoma\u2019s Republican attorney general found that prosecutors had failed to disclose evidence to Glossip that they were obligated to produce and that the evidence showed that the prosecutors\u2019 key witness \u2013 the supposed accomplice of Glossip\u2019s who committed the murder \u2013 had given false testimony.Despite Oklahoma\u2019s assertions that it could no longer stand by Glossip\u2019s conviction, the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeal declined Glossip\u2019s request that his execution be halted.In their filings with the US Supreme Court, Glossip\u2019s attorneys argued that \u2013 in addition to the obviously irreparable harm he would suffer if the execution moves forward \u2013 Oklahoma \u201cwill also suffer harm from its Department of Corrections executing a person whom the State has concluded should never have been convicted of murder, let alone sentenced to die, in the first place.\u201dGlossip\u2019s case has been before the Supreme Court before, including in a major challenge the justices heard in 2015 that he and other death row inmates brought to the lethal injection protocol used in executions.In that case, the court\u2019s conservative majority rejected the inmates\u2019 claims that the lineup of the lethal drugs, which had come under scrutiny after several botched executions, violated the Eighth Amendment\u2019s prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment.Glossip has narrowly avoided being executed on several occasions, including months after the Supreme Court\u2019s 2015 ruling, when the execution was called off at the last minute by state officials because of questions about the drugs they were planning to use."

        "text": "A Pennsylvania man who threw a folding chair at law enforcement and repeatedly used pepper spray on police during the, attack on the US Capitol was sentenced Friday to more than 14 years in prison \u2013 the longest of any January 6 defendant so far., 49, was found guilty on 10 charges in December 2022 during a jury trial, including four felony charges of assaulting, resisting or impeding officers using a dangerous weapon. Schwartz\u2019s prior criminal history of 38 felony convictions dating to 1991 was a significant factor behind his sentence.\u201cMr. Schwartz, dare I say, there are not many people who have come to this court with a criminal history like yours,\u201d District Judge Amit Mehta said during a sentencing hearing on Friday.On January 6, 2021, prosecutors allege that Schwartz thew the first folding chair at police that opened the police line and enabled hundreds of rioters to impede the officers.Schwartz, according to prosecutors, found an abandoned Metropolitan Police Department-issued canister of pepper spray. He then used the irritant to spray officers, causing them to retreat and put on gas masks, and found a second can of pepper spray that he sprayed at officers, they said.Schwartz was on probation during the time of the offenses, according to court documents. During his arrest, law enforcement found that he had at least one firearm in his possession at his residence in Pennsylvania. Schwartz has two prior convictions of possessing a firearm after being convicted of a felony.Schwartz expressed remorse during the hearing.\u201cI do sincerely regret the damage that January 6 has caused to so many people in their lives,\u201d Schwartz said.Mehta responded: \u201cI appreciate you saying what you said today, but I don\u2019t believe it.\u201dThe judge told Schwartz he was being prosecuted not because of his political beliefs or because he was a \u201cpolitical prisoner,\u201d but because he repeatedly broke the law on January 6.\u201cYou were a solider against democracy,\u201d Mehta said. \u201cYou took it upon yourself to try and injure multiple police officers.\u201dFormer Capitol Police Sgt. Aquilino Gonell made a victim impact statement during the hearing. Gonell spoke abouton January 6 and said that someone with a criminal history like Schwartz must be deterred from committing more violent crimes.\u201cI guess the last additional thing he needed to add to his pedigree, was assault of law enforcement officers,\u201d Gonell said.Before imposing the sentence, Mehta said: \u201cIt\u2019s up to you whether you want to take responsibility for your actions. It\u2019s up to you if you want to show remorse. You haven\u2019t done either of them.\u201d"

        "link": "https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/05/politics/desantis-florida-legislature-2024/index.html",
        "text": "After 60 days of pushing through the priorities of Gov.\u2013 a contentious slate of policies that have established Florida as the vanguard of the conservative movement\u2019s latest fascinations \u2013 state lawmakers concluded their annual legislative session Friday.Now, the countdown to DeSantis\u2019 presidential campaign has begun.DeSantis put off an announcement about his political future while lawmakers were at work, looking to rack up policy wins before jumping into the fray. The GOP-controlled legislature, handing DeSantis a potential platform for his White House run while reshaping Florida schools and society in immeasurable ways.will be banned after six weeks with limited exceptions. Permits and trainingto carry a concealed gun in public.allows eight jurors to send someone to death row, the lowest threshold in the nation;child rapists to be executed, in defiance of a US Supreme Court ruling. A bill headed to DeSantis\u2019 desk prohibits undocumented individuals from becoming a lawyer in Florida. Banks can be punished for declining to lend to someone on moral or political grounds. Voter registration groups could face steep fines if they run afoul offor signing up people to vote. It will be harder for teachers unions to organize and keep members. Universities will have to shutter diversity programs.children won\u2019t be able to get gender affirming treatment nor can transgender teachers use their preferred pronouns at school. It will be easier to flag books to be pulled off school shelves and tougher to sue insurance companies. Almost $50 million will be pumped into the takeover of a small liberal arts university to transform it into. Next school year, anyone can send their child to a private school with. And on Thursday, the state Senate passed a bill that would allow an appointed board to review and void previous land agreements in the state \u2013 a win for the governor in his feud with Disney.DeSantis has touted many of these legislative victories in speeches around the country in recent weeks as he promotes his new book and lays the groundwork for a campaign that will contrast his record of conservative accomplishments against other GOP rivals, namely former President Donald Trump.\u201cWe\u2019ve been able to go on a historic run that has never been seen before in this state\u2019s history,\u201d DeSantis said Thursday. \u201cAnd I guarantee you, you put us up against any state, you know, in modern times, and I don\u2019t think you\u2019re going to see the productivity and the boldness that you have seen in Florida across the board.\u201dRepublican allies in the state House and Senate also cleared the way for DeSantis to run for president without resigning and voted to shield his travel records from public disclosure.DeSantis didn\u2019t get everything he wanted. Lawmakers softened his proposed crackdown on illegal immigration by eliminating provisions that block undocumented students from in-state tuition, and they balked at making it easier to sue media organizations for libel. But most of his wish list crossed the finish line.The hard pivot right has provided DeSantis plenty of red meat to delight the sizable crowds he is drawing in early nominating states and the deeply red communities that make up Trump\u2019s base. But his preoccupation with rooting out so-called \u201cwokeness\u201d from public institutions and even private businesses has left some would-be supporters concerned about his viability as he positions himself for a national campaign.Major GOP financiers have lately expressed reservations about DeSantis\u2019 agenda and wondered whether he has already alienated too many potential voters to seriously contend in a general election. Thomas Peterffy, a billionaire businessman who donated $570,000 to DeSantis\u2019 political committee over the years, recently told the Financial Times he and other GOP donors were turned off by DeSantis\u2019 stance on \u201cabortion and book banning\u201d and were \u201cholding our powder dry.\u201d\u201cIf he\u2019s the Republican nominee, I will strongly support him in 2024,\u201d another billionaire, tech mogul Peter Thiel, said in a recent podcast interview, \u201cbut I do worry that focusing on the woke issue as ground zero is not quite enough.\u201dOthers are anxious for him to signal when he is getting into the race to quiet some of the early negative attention about his political strategy and lack of personal touch.\u201cHe\u2019s raised the money. He had the book tour, the international trip,\u201d one Republican fundraiser close to the campaign said. \u201cIt\u2019s time to sh*t or get off the pot. Why stay on the sidelines and not be able to respond to these attacks?\u201dTrump and his allies are treating the Republican governor as if he is already a candidate. Make America Great Again, Inc., a Trump-aligned super PAC, has spent about $8.6 million on ads going after DeSantis. Current GOP primary polls continue to show Trump leading DeSantis by a healthy margin.On a recent international trade mission, a reporter in Tokyo asked DeSantis about Trump polling ahead of him. DeSantis visibly clenched before responding, \u201cI\u2019m not a candidate, so we\u2019ll see if and when that changes.\u201dStill, DeSantis does not appear to be in a rush to announce. On Thursday, DeSantis acknowledged \u201cthere\u2019s only so much time\u201d before a decision must be made, but he noted many bills passed this session by lawmakers remain unsigned and he has prioritized capitalizing on his historic 19-point reelection victory.At a Friday news conference to mark the end of the state legislative session, DeSantis dismissed \u201cchatter\u201d that he was taking too long to announce whether he was running for president.\u201cThe thing that most of you guys should know about me is the chatter is just not something that I worry about. I don\u2019t bother,\u201d the governor said.Next week, DeSantis will resume his political travel with visits to Wisconsin, Illinois and Iowa.\u201cAt the end of the day, these things will happen in relatively due course,\u201d DeSantis said Thursday, adding: \u201cI\u2019m not going to short circuit any of the good work that we\u2019ve done.\u201dAlex Conant, a top adviser to Marco Rubio\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign, said there\u2019s \u201cno reason to launch before June,\u201d and much of the chatter is noise that DeSantis should ignore.\u201cHe was never going to stay as hot as he was after winning a historic landslide election,\u201d Conant said, referring to DeSantis\u2019 nearly 19-point victory in November. \u201cHe\u2019s clearly the strongest positioned to defeat Trump right now. He has the most money, the most name ID and the most political support. But it\u2019s early. He can either build on that or lose that depending on how his launch goes and his debate performance.\u201dSpeculation about an official kickoff date has been rampant, covering much of the calendar between now and July 4 with potential locations ranging from his childhood hometown of Dunedin, Florida, to somewhere along the Rust Belt where his parents are from.The conflicting reports suggest that DeSantis, who has maintained an insular circle of confidants, is playing his cards close to the vest as they finalize their plans. Some who are directly raising money for DeSantis or aiding in the organizational effort remain in the dark on the exact timing and mechanics.The circle has expanded out of necessity as DeSantis builds out a nationwide campaign. Never Back Down, a super PAC expected to play an outsized role boosting DeSantis, has beefed up its staff and is already raising money and advertising on his behalf in the early primary states: Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina and Nevada. The Florida state GOP has also added staff who are expected to eventually shift to a DeSantis campaign.But with the growth has also come more leaks about his operation. For DeSantis, who prizes confidentiality and has weaponized the element of surprise to keep political foes on their toes, information leaking from inside his orbit undermines his assertions that here is \u201cno drama in our administration\u201d and \u201cno palace intrigue\u201d \u2013 a clear contrast with Trump\u2019s reality television White House.One veteran Republican fundraiser said donors and GOP operatives have already sensed that there is tension between the super PAC, staffed with seasoned political hands, and the political operation DeSantis built in Tallahassee full of less inexperienced but fiercely loyal protectors of the governor\u2019s political brand. There have been some disagreements about DeSantis\u2019 best path forward, particularly in light of the Republican\u2019s recent stumbles.\u201cThere is some sniping,\u201d the fundraiser said. \u201cThey\u2019re going to go through growing pains. They have a team that has never done this before. And this is a normal thing you go through. And the question is how they handle it. A lot of people would be envious of where he is. He\u2019s never run before and he\u2019s already 25 percent in the polls. He\u2019s got $100 million. But he\u2019s got to execute better.\u201dNever Back Down spokeswoman Erin Perrine disputed there\u2019s any tension because DeSantis isn\u2019t a candidate \u201cso this palace intrigue drama is way out of place.\u201d\u201cNever Back Down continues to be a grassroots movement focused on getting Governor Ron DeSantis in the race to beat Joe Biden and become president,\u201d she said. \u201cThe Governor has a great team in Florida that landed him a historic re-election victory, and we are hugely supportive of all the work they continue to do to help build momentum for DeSantis.\u201dCNN\u2019s Kit Maher contributed to this report."

Last month, Willis offered immunity deals to several of the Republicans who served as pro-Trump electors and they accepted, according to the filing.The newly secured cooperators could offer insights into a key prong of Willis\u2019s sprawling investigation into election interference: the attempts to put forward alternate slates of electors to block the certification of the 2020 presidential vote and the role Trump\u2019s allies played in organizing the effort.Other Republicans who served as pro-Trump electors could still face legal exposure in her investigation, according to people familiar with the matter.The Friday filing was attorney Kimberly Bourroughs Debrow\u2019s response to an earlier motion from Willis seeking to have Debrow disqualified from the case. Debrow represents a group of the GOP fake electors in Georgia and opposed the motion to have her tossed from the case.\u201cThe District Attorney\u2019s Motion is reckless, frivolous, offensive, and completely without merit,\u201d Debrow wrote in Friday\u2019s filing.The district attorney\u2019s office declined to comment.The district attorney\u2019s office said in an earlier court filing that the fake electors had begun incriminating one another, creating a conflict for Debrow in her joint representation of the fake electors.In Friday\u2019s filing Debrow responded forcefully, writing \u201cthere is no merit to the District Attorney\u2019s claim that any elector incriminated another in their recent interview, and the recordings and transcripts prove it.\u201dThe district attorney\u2019s office also accused Debrow and an attorney she had previously worked with of failing to bring immunity proposals to the GOP fake electors back in 2022.Debrow also disputed that accusation, saying the group of electors turned down \u201cpotential\u201d immunity offers last year but had never been presented with specific and individual offers of immunity until this spring.Willis recently told local law enforcement officials in a letter that she plans to make an announcement on possible charges against Trump or his allies between July 11 and September 1."

He also began attacking the Parkland survivors after they launched the \u201cMarch for Our Lives\u201d movement that called for new gun control measures,.Robinson\u2019s comments about the school shooting survivors were frequently personal, mocking their appearance and intelligence., Robinson shared a photo of several students posing for photos, with the caption, \u201cthe look you get when you let the devil give you a ride on a river of blood to \u201915 minutes of Fameville.\u2019\u201dIn another comment, Robinson shared several crying laughing emojis in response to a post that blasted conservatives who mocked the survivors, writing that when children \u201cgot sassy,\u201d adults needed to make sure the \u201cCHILDREN knew their place.\u201dRobinson did not respond to CNN\u2019s request for comment.As Robinson became known for his fierce defense of gun rights, he was frequently featured inandby the National Rifle Association. Robinson leveraged his often viral and unapologetic Facebook posts to win his party\u2019s nomination for the state\u2019s lieutenant governorship in 2020, winning the race to become the state\u2019s first Black lieutenant governor.Though the position is largely considered a ceremonial role \u2013 and the state has a Democratic governor because the jobs are elected separately \u2013 Robinson has now set his sights on the top job. Roy Cooper, the current Democratic governor, is term-limited, and Robinson would likely face Josh Stein, the state\u2019s attorney general, a Democrat finishing out his second term.CNN\u2019s KFile examined his mostly unreported remarks, as the candidate is coming under renewed scrutiny in his bid for the governor\u2019s mansion. Robinson, who frequently posted in defense of law enforcement, often attacked left wing protesters, going so far as defending the shooting of students at Kent State protesting the Vietnam War in May 1970, commonly known as the \u201cKent State Massacre.\u201dRobinson said such a response deserved to be emulated today.\u201cThe shooting that happened at Kent State now, I don\u2019t know how much you know about that shooting at Kent State, but people have got to understand it,\u201d. \u201cWe have the constitutional right to peacefully assemble. Now peacefully assemble does not mean you could throw bricks at National Guardsmen, bust out windows and block traffic. Once you cross that line into violence and the disruption of public transportation and public services and start blocking the entrances of a federal building, you are no longer a protester.\u201d\u201cYou are are now a criminal and you need to be dealt with like a criminal,\u201d he continued. \u201cAnd we need some politicians in office in some of these cities that\u2019s gonna let people know from the get-go, you go in the street and block traffic, if you block buildings, if you destroy property, you are going to be dealt with swiftly and harshly. We are not going to tolerate it. That is exactly the message that needs to go out to these people. You wanna apply for a permit to protest at the park, that\u2019s fine, but it\u2019s gonna be peaceful and you\u2019re not going to bother anybody, and you\u2019re not going to destroy anything. If you do, you will be dealt with harshly and swiftly.\u201dThoughviolent clashes between local police and protesters in the days leading up to the shooting, the Nixon administration-established President\u2019s Commission on Campus Unrestthat the shooting was unjustified, writing in a 1970 report, \u201cEven if the guardsmen faced danger, it was not a danger that called for lethal force. The 61 shots by 28 guardsmen certainly cannot be justified.\u201dRobinson was also frequently critical of the \u201cMarch for Our Lives\u201d rally itself,, \u201ca march of pawns in Washington today\u201d and mocked attendees.One photo shared by Robinsonat the \u201cMarch for Our Lives\u201d rally in Washington, DC,the college-aged student needed to \u201cput that sign down and go read a book dummy\u201d and \u201cThey live.

        "text": "On at least three occasions over the last two months, former President Donald Trump has claimed that the leaders of unnamed South American countries are deliberately emptying their \u201cinsane asylums\u201d and \u201cmental institutions\u201d to send the patients to the United States as migrants.In eachof the dramatic story, Trump has claimed he recently read about a doctor at a South American mental institution who said he used to be busy but now has no work to do because all of his patients have been released into the US.In a mid-Aprilto the National Rifle Association, Trump said: \u201cI read a story not long ago where a man who takes care of a large segment of people in a mental institution in a South American country, a doctor, sounded like a great man actually \u2013 he said he no longer has anything to do. He used to work 24-hour days. He said, \u2018All of our patients have been released into the United States of America.\u2019\u201dTrump added more color to the story in a Thursday campaignin New Hampshire: \u201cThere was a story recently about a psychologist. Or psychiatrist. But a psychologist. Who worked in mental wards in South America. And he said, \u2018I worked 24\u2026\u2019 \u2013 a good man \u2013 he worked 24 hours a day taking care of very mentally ill people. And he was sitting there reading a newspaper and they asked him, what \u2013 what\u2019s he doing? He said, \u2018I have no more work. The people have all been let go into the United States.\u2019 Can you believe? This is what we\u2019re doing.\u201dBut Trump has given listeners no reason to believe him on this.:It is extremely difficult to definitively prove that a news article about an unnamed mental institution in an unnamed countryexist, so, in the interest of caution, we won\u2019t declare with certainty that Trump\u2019s story is a fabrication \u2013 and we will update this article if someone does provide belated proof. At the very least, though, people should treat his story with great skepticism.CNN conducted a broad search for any proof for Trump\u2019s story.First we reached out to Trump campaign spokesperson Steven Cheung to ask for proof. In response, Cheung sent us links to news articles that were not proof. These articles did not mention anything about South American mental health facilities being emptied under President Joe Biden, nor feature any quote from a doctor at any such facility.Cheung did cite athat late Cuban despot Fidel Castro included mental health patients in the(they made up aof the people involved in the boatlift), but that was 43 years ago; Trump\u2019s stories have all been present-tense claims about events purportedly happening during Biden\u2019s presidency. And Cheung highlighted a 2022from right-wing website Breitbart News about Venezuela supposedly freeing criminals from prison to become migrants. Breitbart\u2019s vague and unverified claim did not mention mental health facilities or doctors at all.We then reached out to a pro-Trump super PAC asking for evidence for Trump\u2019s \u201cmental institution\u201d story, but a spokesperson didn\u2019t respond. We next turned to two groups that advocate for reduced immigration, the Center for Immigration Studies and the Federation for American Immigration Reform, which would be good candidates to be aware of any such evidence. The center\u2019s Mark Krikorian and the federation\u2019s Ira Mehlman also noted the 1980 boatlift from Cuba, but they said they hadn\u2019t seen anything that would corroborate Trump\u2019s claims about the present.Three experts from organizations favorable toward immigration \u2013 Migration Policy Institute president Andrew Selee, American Immigration Council policy director Aaron Reichlin-Melnick and Washington Office on Latin America director for defense oversight Adam Isacson \u2013 also said they had seen nothing to support Trump\u2019s claims. And our own search of online search engines and a database of news articles did not turn up anything.As a last resort, weand invited the public to try to find support for them. More than 30 hours later, nobody had."

        "text": "Former President Donald Trump once backed raising the retirement age to 70 and called for privatizing Social Security which he called a \u201cPonzi scheme\u201d \u2013 two positions he has hammered Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis for supporting as a former member of Congress and congressional candidate.Trump made the comments in 2000 in a book he authored called \u201cThe America We Deserve,\u201d when he was considering a third-party run for president as a member of the Reform Party.,andhave repeatedly cited votes from DeSantis in Congress forthat would have raised the retirement age to 70.The campaign has also cited DeSantis\u2019 praise of Paul Ryan\u2019s budget plans during his 2012 congressional campaign with comments that expressed support for privatizing Social Security and Medicare \u2013 but a CNN KFile review found Trump himself also once praised Ryan on Medicare, along with the 2012 presidential nominee Mitt Romney, without praising their specific policy proposal, which called for similar changes to Ryan\u2019s plan.In his book, Trump lamented big cuts the programwithout changes, and said he would consider privatization.\u201cThe truth is undeniable, the workers of America have been forced to invest a sixth of our wages into a huge Ponzi scheme,\u201d Trump. \u201cThe solution to the Great Social Security Crisis couldn\u2019t be more obvious: Allow every American to dedicate some portion of their payroll taxes to a personal Social Security account that they could own and invest in stocks and bonds.\u201d\u201cWe can also raise the age for receipt of full Social Security benefits to seventy,\u201d he.The Trump campaign told CNN that that as president, Trump \u201chas consistently showed he would always protect entitlements. In contrast, DeSantis has consistently voted to cut entitlements, and has long advocated raising the age of retirement.\u201d\u201cWhen President Trump was elected and went to Washington, DC, he saw just how corrupt and dangerous Paul Ryan was and prevented his disastrous ideas like cutting Social Security and Medicare from coming to fruition,\u201d Steven Cheung, Trump\u2019s spokesman, said in the statement.In a 1999with NBC News\u2019 Tim Russert prior to the release of the book, Trump said he didn\u2019t want to privatize the program but was open to it.\u201cI don\u2019t like the idea of privatizing Social Security. I think it\u2019s certainly something that could be looked at. I think the Social Security system is in very serious trouble. Obviously, it\u2019s always going to be backed by the country, but I think it\u2019s in very serious trouble. I would look at privatization. I don\u2019t know that that\u2019s the answer.\u201d\u201cBut you\u2019d open to it?,\u201d asked Russert .\u201cI\u2019m open to it, yes,\u201d he said.By the 2010s, Trump broke from what was then Republican orthodoxy and said GOP efforts to change entitlement programs like Social Security and Medicare would be political disasters and blasted the Ryan budget \u2013Romney not to embrace it as the nominee of the party.But in the 2012 presidential race, hethe Republican ticket \u2013 and praised Ryan \u2013 saying the pair would save the program. Theirwas similar to the Ryan proposals that Trump has hammered DeSantis for supporting.\u201cI think Paul Ryan and Mitt Romney will save Medicare,\u201d Trumpto Fox News in August 2012. I know they will. And people are starting to understand it. They\u2019re going to be very happy with what\u2019s going on, but they\u2019re going to be very, very unhappy if Obama gets in. I think actually if Obama gets in, and if Obamacare isn\u2019t ended, I really think Medicare will be a thing of the past.\u201dIn October 2012, Trump again strongly praised Ryan on Medicare in an appearance on Fox News \u2013 saying his qualm with Ryan\u2019s budget was he should\u2019ve waited until after the election to make his plans public.\u201cI certainly think it probably would\u2019ve been more appropriate to have waited,\u201d Trump told Sean Hannity. \u201cBut I like the energy he brings. I like a lot of the things he\u2019s saying. He\u2019s smart. He truly understands what\u2019s going on with the 17 trillion and the budgets and everything else.\u201cAnd I think he\u2019s very strongly in favor of \u2013 I know for a fact that he\u2019s gonna save Medicare. The other side\u2019s gonna destroy Medicare. He\u2019s going to save Medicare. And as we know it right now \u2013 not with big deductions and big cuts and big, he\u2019s going to save Medicare. Medicare cannot exist with the other side in office. It will explode.\u201dAs a candidate for the Republican nomination in 2016, Trump reiterated his approach to not touching entitlements, saying his administration would not change either program.Adid eventuallyon Medicare, according to the nonpartisan Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, but those reductions would largely affect doctors and hospitals. At the same time, in an interview, Trump said cuts to entitlements would eventually be on the table.\u201cAt some point they will be,\u201d Trumpin January 2020 in an interview with CNBC, comments that made their way into a response ad last week from ain a potential bid for the White House.Asked by CNBC whether he was willing \u201cto do some of the things that you said you wouldn\u2019t do in the past, though, in terms of Medicare,\u201d Trump said: \u201cWe\u2019re going to look.\u201dIn another interview in 2020, which he again walked back, Trump said he\u2019d be cutting entitlements.When a Fox News host noted that trimming the national debt would require cutting entitlement programs, Trumpthat it would be happening along with economic growth.\u201cOh, we\u2019ll be cutting, but we\u2019re also going to have growth like you\u2019ve never had before,\u201d Trump said."

        "text": "Even as billions of dollars in new clean energy investments surge into Republican leaning communities around the country, state and federal GOP officials are hardening their resistance to efforts to reduce the nation\u2019s reliance on fossil fuels.That stark contrast has dashed a central hope and expectation among environmentalists: the belief that more economic opportunity in red places would mean less political opposition from Republicans to the transition toward a clean energy economy that scientists say is necessary to reduce the risk of catastrophic global climate change. The persistence of GOP opposition to that transition underscores the limits of economic incentives to overcome ideological inclinations \u2013 and points toward years of pitched partisan conflict that could make it virtually impossible for the US to set a consistent course on climate policy.This dynamic was encapsulated last week when virtually every House Republican voted, in the party\u2019s debt ceiling plan, to repeal the clean energy incentives in the Inflation Reduction Act Democrats passed last year, even though those incentivesinvestments in 72 Republican-held districts, including over two dozen districts that have received massive investments of $1 billion or more in new plants or expansions of existing facilities. It\u2019s also apparent in decisions by Republican state attorneys general from states that are among the top beneficiaries of new clean energy investments and jobs to launch a flurry of lawsuits and other legal proceedings against proposals from President Joe Biden\u2019s administration to speed the transition toward a low-carbon economy.This opposition contravenes the traditional assumption that politicians almost always support the economic interests creating opportunity for their constituents. With growing boldness, Republicans and conservative activists are framing defense of fossil fuels and skepticism of clean energy alternatives as a form of culture war \u2013 with the transition to wind, solar and electric vehicles taking its place alongside transgender rights, \u201cwoke\u201d indoctrination in the classroom or restrictions on gun ownership as an example of \u201ccoastal elites\u201d trying to erase traditional American values.In opposing measures to promote clean energy even in places benefiting from new investments to produce it, \u201cRepublicans believe \u2013 and the next election will help us see whether this is a good strategy or not \u2013 that culture war is going to be better to help them win than talking about jobs and the economy,\u201d said Anthony Leiserowitz, director of the Program on Climate Change Communication at Yale University.In all these ways, climate change has become another fissure along the central fault line in modern American politics. Like attitudes toward demographic and cultural change, perspectives on shifting the nation\u2019s energy mix from its historic reliance on fossil fuels toward low-carbon alternatives now pit the Democratic \u201ccoalition of transformation\u201d that largely embraces the way America is changing on every front against the Republican \u201ccoalition of restoration\u201d that resists it.For many Republicans, the Inflation Reduction Act\u2019s sweeping provisions to encourage carbon-free energy sources aren\u2019t \u201ca bipartisan domestic energy agenda,\u201d even though those incentives are channeling substantial jobs and investment to red places, said Robert McNally, a Republican energy consultant and former White House energy adviser for President George W. Bush. \u201cThis is a left wing, coastal \u2018let\u2019s change the world by having the federal government intervene at a time of high inflation kind of thing.\u2019 When a Republican member does the pros and cons, it\u2019s not like they don\u2019t see the pros, but they see a lot of cons.\u201dRepublican-leaning states,, are generally more integrated into the existing fossil fuel economy than blue-leaning places. Trump won 20 of the 21 states that emit the most carbon from their energy sector per each dollar of economic activity, mostly states between the coasts that are either big producers of fossil fuels (Wyoming, West Virginia, Texas) or big consumers of it to power robust agricultural and manufacturing sectors (Iowa, Nebraska, Ohio, Indiana). Biden in turn won 19 of the 21 states with the least emissions, most of them coastal states that produce little oil, gas or coal and have transitioned more rapidly into the post-industrial economy of services and high-tech jobs, such as Massachusetts, New York, Virginia, and California. Representation in the House and Senate, and control of state governments,, with Republicans dominating the high-emitting states and Democrats dominating those with lower emissions. Oil and gas companies now routinelytoward Republicans in Congress.But the energy transition now underway is remaking this picture. Red places are among the clear winners in the emerging clean energy economy. Of the five states that produced the most wind-generated electricity in 2022,to federal statistics, four are solidly red: Texas, Iowa, Oklahoma and Kansas; Illinois is the sole exception. Big solar generating states include Texas and Florida, as well as Arizona, Georgia and Nevada \u2013 places where Republicans control the state legislature, the governorship or both.The Inflation Reduction Act that passed last year on a party line vote is further diffusing these opportunities, though no Republican legislators in either the House or the Senate voted for it.Overall, as of March 31, companies have announced \u201c191 new clean energy projects in small towns and bigger cities nationwide totaling $242.81 billion in new investments,\u201d according to a recent report by the environmental advocacy group Climate Power. Those investments are projected to create some 142,000 jobs, the group calculated. Of the 10 states that have received the most announced clean energy projects, the group found, only two are safely Democratic (New York and California.) The rest are either battleground states (Michigan, Arizona and Georgia) or Republican-leaning (Texas, Ohio, North Carolina, South Carolina and Tennessee).The red tilt on investment is similarly pronounced at the congressional district level. In another study, Climate Powerthat over half of all the new clean energy projects announced since the bill\u2019s passage have been located in Republican-held congressional districts. The Republican district projects account, stunningly, for nearly four-fifths of the total clean energy investments that have been announced. The group found that two dozen House Republicans hold seats where clean energy companies have committed to investments of $1 billion or more since the passage of the IRA. The district that has received the most investment is held by New York Republican Rep. Brandon Williams (whose New York seat is the site of a massive plant that will manufacture semiconductors for EVs) and the district projected to receive the most jobs is held by Nevada Republican Rep. Mark Amodei (which has attracted four separate projects).is building a $2.5 billion solar panel manufacturing facility in the Georgia district of far-right Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene.Many reasons may explain why so much of the new clean energy investment has flowed into red places. Most important may be that Republican states and districts tilt more toward rural areas where space for large manufacturing facilities is easier to acquire. In those states, taxes are typically lower and state regulations more lenient as well. Some companies are also attracted to the non-union environment in most red states.Whatever the motivation for the companies, environmentalists have hoped that channeling more economic benefits from the energy transition into red places would soften the opposition of Republicans toward deemphasizing fossil fuels. The model some cite is how the spread of defense contracts across virtually every congressional district maximizes support for the Pentagon budget.Lori Lodes, executive director of Climate Power, sees that precedent as critical to sustaining a long-term federal effort behind promoting clean energy. \u201cWhat we need it to become is the defense authorization act, where every single congressional district has a piece of it \u2013 and it can\u2019t be undone and we are set on this path of reaching our goals because of how diffuse it is,\u201d she says.But establishing those political roots, she acknowledges, will take time, and in the near term, the torrent of new investment has not diminished Republican resistance. If anything, as Biden leans into measures to accelerate the energy transition, Republicans are stiffening their opposition.\u201cThe harder one side pushes, the harder the other way the other side wants to push back,\u201d said Heather Reams, president of Citizens for Responsible Energy Solutions, a conservative group that supports action on climate change.Last week, almost every House Republican voted for the sweeping bill to raise the debt ceiling that included the repeal of the extensive incentives in the IRA for both producers and consumers to shift to clean energy sources. Earlier this year, everyandRepublican, under an act allowing Congress to challenge federal regulations, voted to overturn a Department of Labor rule that would allow pension fund managers to consider so-called ESG (environmental, social and corporate governance) goals in making investment decisions \u2013 which is considered one important way to encourage more investment in green industries.Biden vetoed that change, butare still seeking to block the regulation in court. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, a likely 2024 GOP presidential candidate, recently organizedto fight such ESG measures, which he derides as \u201cwoke capitalism.\u201dWest Virginia\u2019s Republican Attorney General Patrick Morrisey hasthat when the federal Environmental Protection Agencyrequiring a rapid shift toward electric vehicles, GOP AGs will sue to overturn that, too. No one would be surprised if such a coalition of Republican-controlled states sues as well to block the regulations the Biden EPA isto reduce carbon emissions from power plants. (Such a coalition successfully sued to block former President Barack Obama\u2019s regulations on the same topic.) And it seems inevitable that whenever the EPA completes both its fuel economy and power plant regulations that congressional Republicans will attempt to override them as well. From Republicans, predicts McNally, there will be \u201ccomplete and total opposition on all fronts\u201d to the coming Biden climate regulations. \u201cIt will be kitchen sink \u2013 everything will be going at it.\u201dReams is cautiously optimistic that if Republicans obtained unified control of the White House and Congress in 2025, they would preserve at least some of the IRA\u2019s clean energy incentives as part of an \u201call of the above\u201d strategy to encourage more domestic production of both fossil fuels and low-carbon sources. But McNally, in a view shared from across the political spectrum by Lodes, predicts that if Republicans win unified control, they will \u201cgut\u201d the IRA clean energy incentives that they voted to eliminate last week. \u201cNinety-eight percent of this is going to go,\u201d he says.When I reached out to several House Republicans last week to ask why they voted to rescind the IRA incentives although their districts have received big clean energy investments, most either did not respond or refused to comment. (In the latter camp was Utah Rep. John Curtis, who chairs the Conservative Climate Caucus and whose district has received $11 billion in clean energy investments, according to Climate Power.)One who did respond was Amodei, the Nevada Republican. He exemplifies the depth of Republican skepticism to the Democratic agenda to combat climate change. His northern Nevada district contains not only a massive (and expanding) Tesla plant, but also a factory being built by another battery company, Redwood Materials. Between them, the Redwood plant and Tesla expansion are expected to create 4,600 permanent manufacturing jobs as well as many construction jobs, according to news accounts.Yet Amodei voted last week to repeal all the IRA\u2019s incentives to encourage more production and consumption of electric vehicles. In an interview, he said the pace at which Biden and Democrats want to transition transportation toward EVs was unrealistic. \u201cDo I think electricity is the future? Absolutely,\u201d Amodei said. But he added, \u201ceven with all these billions of dollars being poured into these things in the form of subsidies and penalties\u201d the rate at which Biden hopes to shift Americans into electric vehicles \u201cborders on suicidal.\u201dMoreover, he asserted that Nevada companies are largely being excluded from the construction jobs generated by the big plant expansions in his district, and that the bigger concern for most constituents he represents is the risk that the IRA\u2019s increased spending will fuel inflation. \u201cThe benefits\u201d of the bill, he says, \u201cI don\u2019t think outweigh the negative stuff in terms of debt, inflation and oh, by the way, how much really came to Nevada?\u201dAmodei is one of the Republican members that Climate Power and the League of Conservation Voters havewith ads criticizing their votes. Lodes says his claim that Nevada residents aren\u2019t benefiting from the new jobs in his district \u201cjust doesn\u2019t hold water.\u201d She says the group\u2019s challenge is to make clear to voters in the Republican districts benefiting from clean energy investments that their Representatives voted to repeal the incentives encouraging that spending. \u201cThe case we will have to make to voters is that every single one of these MAGA extremists put their agenda ahead of their constituents,\u201d she says.That argument could prove effective in some swing districts, particularly those with a large number of college-educated voters. But most House Republicans represent solidly GOP-leaning areas. And demand for action against climate change has remained minimal inside the GOP coalition. Leiserowitz says that in, only a very small percentage of even moderate Republicans cite climate as an important issue for government to address and that the share of all Republicans who support developing more clean energy sources is actually dropping. Republican voters are far more likely to say they support more domestic drilling for oil and gas. The vast majority of Republican voters even say they will never consider buying an electric vehicle,. Democrats mostly take the opposite positions, placing far greater priority on climate change as a problem and expressing much more interest in changing not only public policy but also their personal behavior to combat it.Reams says that disparity has created a striking dynamic, with Republican-leaning communities producing the clean energy favored by Democratic-leaning consumers: \u201cYou have a phenomenon of red supply for blue demand,\u201d she says.Like many environmentalists to her left, Reams believes that as the clean energy industries become more \u201cingrained\u201d in GOP-leaning areas, \u201cmore Republicans will say \u2018I can\u2019t repeal that.\u2019\u201d The historical behavior of members of Congress says she\u2019s right; but those precedents may no longer apply.Over time, more clean energy investments and jobs in Republican-leaning places should make the case for transition more compelling. Likewise, even in those red areas, more consumers may also experience benefits from renewable power sources or the cost savings of operating electric vehicles. \u201cClean energy, electric vehicles, all the things associated with these things are going to become part of normal life in America,\u201d says Leiserowitz. The result is that people \u201cwill ask, \u2018How can you be against something when everybody is doing it?\u2019\u201dBut all these traditional dynamics could be offset if clean energy continues to get pulled into the right\u2019s culture war case against \u201cwoke\u201d elites. Across a panoramic range of issues \u2013 from abortion, LGBTQ rights and guns to classroom censorship and book bans \u2013 Republicans, especially in red states,of their predominantly conservative electoral coalition against what they consider liberal efforts to uproot the US from its traditions. So long as Republican voters are convinced to see the clean energy transition as part of that threat, even gleaming new factories and fat new paychecks may not much soften the party\u2019s sweeping resistance to climate action."

        "text": "Add another election lie to the long, long list.Former President Donald Trump has tried for nearly two and a half years to convince Americans that he was the rightful winner of the 2020 presidential election he lost fair and square to Joe Biden. He is still trying today, in 2023, as he seeks the Republican presidential nomination once more.But Trump\u2019s latest supposed piece of evidence, like hissupposed pieces of evidence, is complete bunk.In a speech to a Republican gathering in Florida on Friday, during which he repeated his usual lie that the 2020 election was \u201crigged and stolen,\u201d Trump pointedly noted that Biden got more votes than Trump in fewer than a fifth of US counties in 2020. Trump then said, \u201cNothing like this has ever happened before. Usually it\u2019s very equal, or \u2013 but the winner always had the most counties.\u201d:Biden carried about 17% of counties while beating Trump in 2020, a smaller percentage of counties than Obama carried while winning in 2008 and 2012, but there is nothing odd about the 2020 figure. In fact, it\u2019s easy to explain. Land doesn\u2019t vote, people do. In the current political era, Democratic presidential candidates have tended to be dominant in the most populous counties, some of which have hundreds of thousands or, while Republicans have tended to do best in areas with fewer residents.\u201cThere is nothing suspicious about winning the presidency with a smaller number of counties,\u201d, a senior fellow at The Brookings Institution think tank, said in an email. \u201cCounties vary widely in size, with large urban and suburban counties \u2013\u2013 housing far larger populations than most of the outer suburb, small town and rural counties that Trump won.\u201dHere\u2019s an example of why winning a county is not inherently significant. Trump handilyLoving County, Texas, in 2020 \u2013 but that county had an. Biden, conversely, handily carried Harris County, Texas, which had an estimated mid-2020 population of 4.7 million people.If you\u2019re counting all county victories as equal, that\u2019s a tie, one county for Trump and one county for Biden. But Biden netted more than 217,000 extra votes from the 1-for-1 trade.The split between vote totals, which determine who wins the election, and the counties-carried tally, which is an inconsequential matter of trivia, could keep getting wider. Said Frey, a well-known demographer: \u201cThe residents of Biden-won counties represent faster growing parts of the population \u2013 people of color, college graduates, foreign born and single people \u2013 than those the that dominate Trump counties. Trump counties will continue to grow more slowly than Biden counties.\u201dHere is what happened in the last five presidential elections won by Democrats; all of these candidates lost a majority of counties while comfortably winning the Electoral College and popular vote. The county figures are all courtesy of Wasserman. He excluded Alaska, which uses a system of boroughs rather than counties.: Won 1,524 counties out of 3,112, or about 49%. Won the Electoral College 370 to 168. Won the popular vote by 5.81 million.: Again won 1,524 counties out of 3,112, or about 49%. Won the Electoral College 379 to 159. Won the popular vote by 8.20 million.: Won 875 counties out of 3,113, or about 28%. Won the Electoral College 365 to 173. Won the popular vote by 9.55 million.: Won 693 counties out of 3,113, or about 22%. Won the Electoral College 332 to 206. Won the popular vote by 4.98 million.: Won 538 counties out of 3,113, or about 17%. Won the Electoral College 306 to 232. Won the popular vote by 7.06 million."

Jean Carroll andrested their respective cases in the battery and defamation trial against the former president in Manhattan federal court on Thursday evening.Carroll, a former magazine columnist, alleges Trump raped her in the Bergdorf Goodman department store in the mid-1990s and then defamed her when he denied her claim, said she wasn\u2019t his type and suggested she made up the story to boost sales of her book. Trump has denied all wrongdoing.Trump seeks to move New York hush money criminal case to federal courtWhile resting his case means Trump legally waived his right to testify in his own defense, District Judge Lewis Kaplan left a window for Trump to change his mind over the weekend.Kaplan ruled that Trump\u2019s legal team has until 5 p.m. Sunday to petition the court to reopen the defense case for the sole purpose of allowing Trump to testify. The judge said he ordered the precautionary measure in light of Trump\u2019s public comments made earlier Thursday suggesting he would make an appearance in court before the trial ended.Trump, who has not appeared in the courtroom at any point during the trial, told reporters in Ireland on Thursday he\u2019ll \u201cprobably attend\u201d the trial.\u201cI have to go back for a woman that made a false accusation about me, and I have a judge who is extremely hostile,\u201d Trump said in Doonbeg, Ireland, according to Reuters.Donald Trump mistook E. Jean Carroll for his ex-wife Marla Maples in a photo, deposition transcripts showDuring a sidebar on Thursday afternoon, Trump\u2019s attorney tried repeatedly to reassure Kaplan that his client would not take the stand and implied that the judge has an idea of what it\u2019s like representing the former president.\u201cI know you understand what I am dealing with,\u201d Joe Tacopina told the judge, according to a court transcript.If Trump does not change his mind, the parties are set to give closing arguments to the jury at 10 a.m. on Monday.Carroll\u2019s legal team put on 11 witnesses in her case including the writer herself over seven trial days.Earlier Thursday the jury saw more clips of Trump\u2019s video-recorded deposition taken last October for this case in which \ufeffTrump vehemently denies Carroll\u2019s rape allegations against him.\u201cShe\u2019s accusing me of rape, a woman that I have no idea who she is. It came out of the blue. She\u2019s accusing me of rape \u2013 of raping her, the worst thing you can do, the worst charge. And you know it\u2019s not true too. You\u2019re a political operative also. You\u2019re a disgrace. But she\u2019s accusing me and so are you of rape, and it never took place,\u201d Trump said on video, addressing Carroll\u2019s attorney Roberta Kaplan.Trump denies raping E. Jean Carroll or pressuring any woman to have sex with him in newly unsealed depositionTrump stood by his social media posts published in 2019 and 2022 denying Carroll\u2019s accusations and confirmed he personally wrote them.At one point during the deposition, Trump held a well-known black and white photo of himself, E Jean Carroll, her former husband news anchor John Johnson, and Trump\u2019s then-wife Ivana.Trump recognized Johnson and recalled thinking he was good at his television job, but then mistook Carroll for his other ex-wife Marla Maples.\u201cThat\u2019s Marla, yeah. That\u2019s my wife,\u201d he said.After the attorneys corrected him, Trump said the photo was blurry.He acknowledged the photo suggests he met Carroll at least once but said it must have been very brief at an event and he does not remember or know her.\u201cI still don\u2019t know this woman. I think she\u2019s a whack job. I have no idea. I don\u2019t know anything about this woman other than what I read in stories and what I hear. I know nothing about her,\u201d the former president said.\u201cShe\u2019s a liar and she\u2019s a sick person in my opinion, Really sick. Something wrong with her,\u201d Trump said during another point in the deposition.Carroll\u2019s attorney asked Trump about his comments regarding Carroll, Jessica Leeds and Natasha Stoynoff all not being \u201chis type.\u201dHe stood by the statements each time he was asked. At one point he said, \u201cthe only different between me and other people is I\u2019m honest.\u201dHe also told Carroll\u2019s attorney she\u2019s not his type. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t be a choice of mine either to be honest,\u201d Trump said.He also said he felt like he had a right to insult the women who\u2019ve accused him falsely.\u201cI don\u2019t want to be insulting but when people accuse me of something I think I have a right to be insulting because they\u2019re insulting me,\u201d Trump said.The jury watched Trump view the \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tape during his deposition. He didn\u2019t appear to noticeably react as it was played.When asked about the tape he said it\u2019s already been \u201cfully litigated\u201d and, \u201cit\u2019s locker room talk, I don\u2019t know, it\u2019s just the way people talk.\u201dFormer local news anchor Carol Martin testified Thursday that she remembers Carroll confiding in her soon after the alleged assault by Trump in the mid-1990s.Martin testified under direct examination that she didn\u2019t remember when exactly it happened, but she knew it was some time while the two were working at the same cable network between 1994 and 1996.By Martin\u2019s account the two friends had finished taping their respective shows and Carroll asked if she could come over Martin\u2019s home near the studio. They talked in her kitchen for about an hour, Martin testified, and Carroll was \u201cfrenzied.\u201dCarroll\u2019s \u201ceffect was anxious and excitable, but she can be that way sometimes so that part wasn\u2019t as different but what she was saying didn\u2019t make any sense at first.\u201d The conversation was not linear, Carroll started her account saying, \u201cYou won\u2019t believe what happened to me the other night,\u201d Martin recalled.\u201cAnd I didn\u2019t know what to expect,\u201d Martin said she felt at the time. Carroll repeatedly said, \u201cTrump attacked me,\u201d according to Martin.\u201cI think she said \u2018he pinned me\u2019 and I still didn\u2019t know what she meant,\u201d Martin testified.Martin testified that she told Carroll she shouldn\u2019t tell anyone her story. \u201cBecause it was Donald Trump and he had a lot of attorneys and I thought he would bury her is what I told her,\u201d Martin said.\u201cI have questioned myself more times than not over the years. I am not proud that that\u2019s what I told her in truth but she didn\u2019t contest,\u201d Martin added.During cross-examination, Tacopina read through a series of messages Martin has sent friends, many to Carroll, speaking negatively about Trump for years since he first ran for the presidency.Martin testified that as \u201cvery liberal feminist women,\u201d they frequently discussed politics including their dislike for Trump. \u201cWe would often talk about ways to change the climate or work on issues of interest to us,\u201d Martin testified.Tacopina also read the jury several messages Martin sent to friends and family about Carroll\u2019s lawsuit against Trump that appeared to criticize Carroll. \u201cShe\u2019s gonna sue when adult victims of rape law is passed in New York State or something. WTF that\u2019s the defamation case and DOJ oversight or something. It\u2019s gone to another level and not something I can relate to. For her, sadly, I think this quest has become a lifestyle,\u201d Martin wrote in one text.Martin responded in court that at the time she sent the messages she was dealing with serious matters in her own personal life that affected her feelings toward Carroll\u2019s situation. She testified that the texts do not reflect her current feelings.A marketing expert commissioned by Carroll testified it would take up to $2.7 million to run an effective marketing campaign to repair her reputation just from the damage of Trump\u2019s October 12, 2022, comments denying her allegations.Northwestern University Professor Ashlee Humphreys said that Trump\u2019s statement at issue in this trial reached somewhere between 13.7 and 18 million impressions.Humphreys and a team of researchers evaluated the post first published on Truth Social and how it spread across mediums like other social media platforms, websites and cable and network broadcast television.In a series of calculations Humphreys said about 21% of the people who viewed the statement in some capacity \u2013 about 3.7 to 5.6 million people \u2013 likely believed Trump. The analysis did not consider the effects of previous statements Trump made about Carroll.On cross examination Humphreys acknowledged that she did not consider damage done to Trump by Carroll\u2019s statements against him."

        "text": "Evenbecome routine after a while for many Americans not yet directly affected.Another city goes into lockdown. Millions of smartphones flash with news of the latest horror. Video shows police storming into another building and snaking lines of survivors being rushed to safety. Soon, muted TVs playing cable news in tire shops, bars and airports nationwide show speeding ambulances and white-coated hospital spokespeople briefing on trauma injuries. It may be a day before the family snapshots of the victims emerge.Mass shootings end lives in a senseless instant. Survivors may take months to recover, if they ever do. And the agony of those close to the victims will never end. But for most of the rest of the country, life goes on, because there\u2019s no other way.On Wednesday, it was, where a gunman became enraged during a visit to a midtown medical facility, allegedly shooting dead at least one person with a handgun and injuring four others before he was caught hours later after a manhunt.Police detail the hourslong manhunt that ended in the Atlanta shooting suspect's arrestGeorgia state Sen. Josh McLaurin was in midtown for lunch, when he suddenly found himself faced with a frightening emergency that more and more Americans are experiencing.\u201cIn the middle of lunch, I just started hearing people say, \u2018Hey, we are on lockdown, there is an active shooter next door,\u201d\u2019 McLaurin, a Democrat, told CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper.\u201cThe thing I was overwhelmed by today is this is how people are expected to live now. You could just go out to lunch or go to the doctor\u2019s office, or go to daycare which is nearby and drop your kid off and you have got a lockdown that lasts most of the day and (are) covered by this fear and uncertainty about what is happening to your loved ones,\u201d McLaurin said.Atlanta Mayor Andre Dickens warnedthat this new reality must not be allowed to prevail.\u201cWe cannot accept mass shootings as normal in our country,\u201d Dickens wrote in an open letter to his city. \u201cWhile we respect the rights conveyed by the 2nd Amendment, we also need more actions to protect the rights of our citizens to go about their lives \u2014 to go to a doctor\u2019s office, a supermarket, a gas station, their school \u2014 without the threat of being gunned down.\u201dIt\u2019s hard to keep all the different shootings in all the different towns straight.Days ago,, joined the roster of random death, after an armed man shot dead five people in a neighborhood dispute. The killing spree was triggered when a family asked the man to stop firing his gun in his yard. This came after horror unfolded inandin recent weeks. On a single weekend last month, there were mass shootings spanning six states, killing at least 10 people. Inthe futility of senseless violence raging out of control was underscored by carnage at a Sweet 16 party, when four people were shot dead and at least 32 others were wounded.But the attention quickly shifted, as it always does, to the next mass shooting, leaving the bereaved and injured to pick up their broken lives.Had any of these events been caused by a foreign terrorist organization, or an overseas adversary, they might have spurred a national push for action. But in America, mass shootings are part of the background noise of daily life. They are part of the national reality \u2013 almost like bad weather \u2013 that causes people to shudder and hope it doesn\u2019t affect their neighborhoods or their families before they carry on with their lives.There is strong support for some gun safety measures, like tightening background checks and, among Democrats, an assault-style weapons ban. But the reality of divided power in Washington means that the chances of enacting change are very low. Many Republicans see any gun control measures as tantamount to a complete repudiation of the Second Amendment. And several GOP presidential candidates, including ex-President Donald Trump, are placing gun rights at the center of their campaigns while many GOP-led state legislatures are loosening gun laws.The apparent low prospects of any action to stem endless violence means that some political reaction after gun massacres is becoming as routine as the tragedies themselves. Rote tweets from GOP lawmakers offering \u201cthoughts and prayers\u201d for gun violence victims became a clich\u00e9. Now the same can be said of post-mass shooting warnings from Democrats that \u201cthoughts and prayers are not enough.\u201d Debates about better mental health care and \u201cred flag\u201d laws that might save some lives are becoming just as wearied by repetition.Texas massacre suspect charged with 5 counts of murder as investigators say his longtime partner gave him food and clothes while on the runMajorities of Americans might be open to some limited changes, but most also know the polarized politics of the right to bear arms \u2013 an existential part of national identity for many Americans \u2013 means that even rudimentary reforms are unlikely.So the new national reality prevails: Anywhere \u2013 a school, a backyard, a bar, a medical office or a bank \u2013 can suddenly become the latest backdrop for the gun violence epidemic. Nowhere is safe in a nation with more firearms than people. What all this does to the psyche of a country may become clear in the years ahead. Already, a generation of kids has grown up scarred by active shooter drills and the fear that their school might be next.Tyrisia Woods, who was in the Atlanta medical facility where the shots were fired on Wednesday, summed up the latent fear many Americans feel when she told CNN she had not felt safe coming into work because her building lacked metal detectors.\u201cWe have active shooters in Midtown so often, our buildings are locked down a lot,\u201d Woods said. \u201cI just really feel unsafe working in that area.\u201dIn another sign of America\u2019s mass shooting reality, surgeons spoke again on Wednesday of how they modified medical procedures and prepared detailed plans for mass casualty events \u2013 one of which swung quickly into action in Atlanta.Dr. Robert Jansen, chief medical officer of Grady Health System, told CNN\u2019s Wolf Blitzer that as soon as the first reports of a mass shooting emerged, doctors, nurses, trauma surgeons and respiratory therapists went on alert and operating rooms were opened.\u201cWhen these types of events happen, unfortunately we have to be prepared, and we were prepared,\u201d Jansen said.It won\u2019t be long before the events in Atlanta on Wednesday \u2013 or those at a bank in Louisville last month \u2013 will play out somewhere else.Democratic Rep. Lucy McBath of Georgia, who lost her 17-year-old son to gun violence in 2012, said on CNN\u2019s \u201cThe Situation Room\u201d: \u201cI don\u2019t know how much more blood and carnage my colleagues in Washington and also in state legislatures all around the country have to see. What more does it take?\u201dJudging by this week, America\u2019s reality isn\u2019t about to change soon."

        "link": "https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/06/politics/nationalism-conservatism-what-matters/index.html",
        "text": "The American right wing, long identified with the conservative movement, is increasingly latching onto something very different \u2013 nationalism \u2013 which frightens some students of history but is inspiring to a new breed of Republicans.Some recent examples:These moments, which seem unremarkable to a regular consumer of news, remind us that the Republican Party has been struggling for decades to reconcile its internal partnership of nationalists and conservatives. If you just woke up to American politics in the past 30 years, the two terms seem synonymous, but they haven\u2019t always been.So what is a nationalist and what is a conservative? And does it matter if we use these termsinterchangeably?First, a quick definition: When academics use \u201cnationalism\u201d by itself, it\u2019s the concept that some kind of identity matters more than philosophy. That can be a place, an ethnicity or a religion. In current US politics, we typicallysee that identitywith Christian nationalism or White nationalism.Whether you throw all the way back to the philosopherEdmund Burke or start with former PresidentRonald Reagan, conservatism has typically meant a resistance to radical change and a faith in caution, especially when it comes to government\u2019s role in a citizen\u2019s life.Many conservatives bristle at being lumped in with the very idea of nationalism, even without add-ons like \u201cChristian\u201d or \u201cWhite.\u201d Their version of conservatism is irrespective of place.Former Heritage Foundation Executive Vice President Kim Holmesthat \u201cAmerican conservatives have argued that one of the great things about America was that it was different from all other countries. Different from all other nationalisms.\u201dTrump flipped that more openprinciple of conservatismaround when he declared himself to be a \u201c\u201d in 2018. Most of his policy proposals as president were focused on putting \u201cAmerica First.\u201dFor Holmes, American identity is \u201cbased on a universal creed \u2026grounded in America\u2019s founding principles.\u201d Holmes sees kindred spirits and a shared struggle with conservatives elsewhere in the world who might share those principles.Conservativism as a concept wasn\u2019t even partisan in the 20th century. Joe Biden embraced the term during his first term in the US Senate,in 1974, \u201cWhen it comes to civil rights and civil liberties, I\u2019m a liberal but that\u2019s it. I\u2019m really quite conservative on most other issues.\u201dOver time, the term has evolved. As Lee Drutman, a political scientist at the think tank New America and author of \u201cBreaking the Two-Party Doom Loop: The Case for Multiparty Democracy in America,\u201d told me, \u201cOnce upon a time, there was a consistent meaning, but now you can be a national security conservative, an economic conservative, a social conservative. It\u2019s become more of an identity.\u201dHolmes said when conservatives lose confidence in the strength of their philosophy, it risks becoming an identity. \u201cThey think that traditional fusionist conservatism and the American exceptionalism idea are not strong enough. These ideas are not muscular enough. They want something stronger to stand up to the universal claims of globalism and progressivism that they believe are anti-American.\u201dSuch a partnership between nationalism and conservatism, argues Angie Maxwell, a political science professor at the University of Arkansas, was forged in the middle of the 20th century when the Republican Party worked to break the hold theDemocratic Party hadon the South since the Reconstruction to the late 20th century.\u201cWe see the Republican Party try to adopt the specific brand of Southern White conservatism,\u201d she said.Maxwell said while the party was divided over the strategy, various Republican campaigns noted they could pick up voters by emphasizing Christian values, anti-feminism and racial resentment. In the 1960s, she noted, sentiments on those three dynamics would split evenly among members of both parties, while today those views are disproportionately felt by Republican voters.Which leads us to today, where Rep.Marjorie Taylor Greene, a Republican from Georgia,, \u201cWe need to be the party of nationalism and I\u2019m a Christian, and I say it proudly, we should be Christian nationalists.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s nothing conservative about Marjorie Taylor Greene, if conservative means we should tread with caution, we should not blow things up, we should have restraint and humility,\u201d argued Drutman, harkening back to Burke, who many consider the founder of modern conservatism. \u201cIn some ways, (former President Barack)Obama is much more of a Burkean conservative.\u201dDrutman noted that some forms of nationalism are benign: \u201cYou can argue that\u2019s what\u2019s great about America \u2013that we have a diverse and pluralist society, (that) America is the greatest nation in the world because we welcome everyone.\u201dWhat concerns Drutman is Greene\u2019s kind of identity-driven nationalism.\u201cWhat is changed in our politics is the extent to which our political divisions have led us to see competing viewpoints as illegitimate. For half the country to treat the other half as if they were a threat to the country,\u201d Drutman said. \u201cMaybe there are some issues where we should be more conservative. They become dangerous when their adherents deny that there is legitimate opposition.\u201dThat also concerned Holmes, writing in 2019 before Greene was elected, when he warned, \u201cNationalism is devoid of a common idea or principle of government except that a people or a nation-state can be almost anything. It can be fascist, it can be authoritarian, it can be totalitarian, or it can be democratic.\u201d"

        "text": "Two converging crises are testing American confidence in their financial well-being.There\u2019s a, which regulatory officials and big American banks very much want you to believe is ending after decisive action over the weekend to take over and swallow up another failing bank.And there\u2019s a debt crisis, which is becoming more urgent as the US approaches the \u201cX-date\u201d \u2013 when it would default \u2013 and on which opposing lawmakers aren\u2019t currently talking to each other.Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said Monday the. But it has been a moving target.President Joe Biden on Monday, including House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, to discuss raising the debt ceiling, according to two sources familiar with the matter.Americans woke up Monday to news that a third US bank, First Republic, had failed. Having catered to, First Republic had been on the edge of collapsesince March, when two other regional banks failed.First Republic Bank was taken over by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation on Monday,and most of its assets were sold to JPMorgan Chase. The culmination of government regulators and thebanking industry came together to protect creditors and maintain confidence in the banking system as a whole without exposing taxpayers to an unpopular bailout.\u201cNobody is crying over First Republic Bank,\u201d said Christine Romans, CNN\u2019s chief business correspondent, during an appearance on \u201cCNN This Morning.\u201d\u201cBut you don\u2019t want chaos and turmoil to spread to the rest of the banking system,\u201d she added,.The former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers, speaking to Bloombergbefore the takeover, said it\u2019s important to tamp downtroubles in the banking system because they can easily spread.\u201cThese things are like forest fires,\u201d said Summers. \u201cIt is much easier to prevent them than it is to contain them after they start to spread.\u201dPraising the intervention, Biden tried to reassure Americans that the banking system was \u201csafe and sound\u201d during an appearance in Washington, DC, on Monday.None of that means this is a golden chapter for the American financial system. The failure of three banks this year suggests a hard look at how banks are overseen. And the Federal Reserve has lost some credibility among top economists.Confused about the First Republic Bank mess? Here's how to speak Wall Street\u201cIt remains to be seen whether the still-simmering financial turmoil triggered by SVB\u2019s (Silicon Valley Bank) collapse will boil over into a deeper crisis, but investors and depositors have no reason to trust the Fed\u2019s assurances that it will not,\u201d Joseph Stiglitz, a Columbia University professor and Nobel laureate,. \u201cOnly meaningful reforms of deposit insurance, governance, regulatory structure and supervision can restore confidence in banks and the Fed\u2019s credibility.\u201dIn fact, the FDIC is advocating to raise the amount of deposits insured above the current $250,000 cap..If only American lawmakers could take a cue from the First Republic saga and get into a room to solve the debt crisis.Instead, Republican and Democratic lawmakers are still posturing even though the country is a month or so away from the X-date, when it begins defaulting on its debts.What exactly would happen immediately after the X-date is not entirely clear, but it could lead to a crisis of confidence in the US government, making it more difficult to continue to finance Social Security and Medicare; threaten the value of the dollar, which has been a cornerstone of the world economy; and tip the country into a recession..Rather than clearing their calendars to make sure the government can continue to write checks for all the debt it has already accrued, lawmakers are still in their partisan corners.Last week, House Republicans made theirin the negotiations by passing a bill to indiscriminately lop off billions in federal spending, revert to 2022 spending levels, undo anti-climate change spending championed by Democrats and impose new. The bill, which is a nonstarter in the Senate, would also guarantee another debt debate this time next year.This week, rather than hash things out, McCarthy is in Jerusalem, meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\u201cThe president still hasn\u2019t talked to me,\u201d, making clear he wants to negotiate with Biden.The White House, meanwhile, has argued there should be no negotiation over paying bills for debt sold to cover spending already authorized by Congress.\u201cAmerica is not a deadbeat nation,\u201d Biden said during that event in Washington, using the term associated with parents who fail to pay child support. \u201cWe have never ever failed to meet the debt. And as a result, one of the most respected nations of the world, we pay our bills and we should do so without reckless hostage taking from some of the MAGA Republicans in Congress.\u201dI asked Justin Wolfers, a professor ofeconomics and public policy at the University of Michigan, what separates the debt crisis from the banking crisis.He told me over the phone he\u2019s not at all worried about the money he has deposited in an American bank, arguing he has complete confidence in the FDIC to cover deposits, as it and banks have done for all three banks that failed this year.He also pointed out the bank failures represent three relatively small institutions by US standards.But he is extremely worried about the US defaulting on its debt.\u201cThis generation of bank regulators learned from the mistakes of the Great Depression and the 2008 financial crisis,\u201d Wolfers said, suggesting they have no qualms about stepping in early to maintain confidence in the financial system.There is no similar confidence in the nation\u2019s politicians to do the same.\u201cThere\u2019s a great fear that this generation of legislators are more irresponsible, more polarized and more willing to do damage than any previous generation,\u201d he said.We will, at some point in the very near future, get to the place where Biden and McCarthy, along with other top Democrats and Republicans, must come together to avoid a default or deal with the aftermath of its occurrence. The question is whether the economy is damaged in the meantime.\u201cI will tell you that I am more worried than I\u2019ve ever been in my career, at this moment, about the sky actually falling,\u201d Wolfers said, noting that in previous standoffs over the debt ceiling, Republicans have ultimately stood down in the face of pressure from more moderate wings of the party. It\u2019s not clear that will happen this time."

        "text": "Millions of eyes were on Britain, but what message did the Coronation send out about the country, aside from confirming prejudices about our dreadful weather? This is my view from the sofa - six takeaways from a historic day.We knew this would be a real spectacle, but from my front row seat (in my sitting room) much of it still felt from a bygone era. This was Britain with all its pomp on show. Golden carriages, weighty robes of state and jewel-encrusted crowns.It's hardly surprising there were so many arcane traditions, in a ceremony that dates back 1,000 years at Westminster Abbey. But who knew, until Coronation day, that swords have names?The Sword of State and the Sword of Offering - more about them later - the Sword of Temporal Justice, the Sword of Spiritual Justice, the Sword of Mercy.Or that Princess Anne would be known as the Gold-Stick-in-Waiting.Or that there are bracelets of sincerity and wisdom?Of course it felt removed from Britain in 2023, in the middle of a cost of living crisis.But as the queen of grunge, Courtney Love Cobain tweeted, she was \"loving the religion & strangeness & pageantry\".And so were many others. This kind of display is what distinguishes Britain from the rest of the world.  We're good at it, aren't we?The historian David Olusoga said there is an argument the ceremony makes us \"more aware of how ancient, how, in some ways, unlike the country, these traditions are\".But among the tradition, effort had been made to ensure modern Britain was also being reflected.For me that began with the blue, almost punk-like plumage of the horses pulling the carriage in the King's procession from Buckingham Palace. Although in fact woven braids date back to Queen Victoria's coronation.We saw it in the inclusion of the King and Queen's blended family in the service. In the representatives of other faiths.In the sceptre carried by national treasure Baroness Floella Benjamin.In the women bishops who were involved in a coronation for the first time ever.There was a message of diversity and inclusion that had been carefully crafted, but nonetheless felt sincere.Another first were the girl choristers.Their voices rang out as King Charles and Queen Camilla walked into the abbey.\"I Was Glad\" has been performed at every coronation since 1626. I've always marvelled at Sir Hubert Parry's version, composed for Edward VII in 1902.Afterwards, Gareth Malone, who will conduct the Coronation Choir at the concert at Windsor on Sunday night, told me \"you'll never hear it that well performed ever again\".For hours on Saturday, the abbey was filled with simply wonderful music.Malone's highlights also included the \"beautiful haunting harmonies\" of the new composition by Paul Mealor of Kyrie Eleison, sung in Welsh (the first time that language has been heard in a coronation service) by the opera star Sir Bryn Terfel and the \"timeless, spiritual\" Byzantine Chant Ensemble, in Greek.And Handel's Zadok the Priest at the time of the anointing was a particularly electric moment.From a King with a lifelong passion for music, we were treated to a composition arc, from Orlando Gibbons in the Elizabethan period through William Byrd and Handel to Vaughan Williams and on to composers of today.King Charles personally commissioned 12 new pieces for his Coronation, including a show-stopping performance by the eight-strong gospel Ascension Choir.The artistry on show was breath taking.In 1953, as a little girl in Lancashire, my mum watched the coronation at the home of a family friend who had got a TV for the occasion. By televising the event, the new Queen Elizabeth heralded in the age of television. Some 20 million people saw the live broadcast.Now 70 years on, we watched a coronation in full colour - and the ways we interacted with the event were transformed. Not just TV, but live streaming online, clips turned around on social media, radio with and without commentary, memes. Smartphones have made us all photographers and there will be reams of footage out there.We'll also be getting official coronation photographs by Hugo Burnand.Cecil Beaton's portrait of Queen Elizabeth will be hard to beat. That iconic photograph combined the power of majesty and the optimism placed in the young queen.King Charles is the oldest monarch ever crowned in the abbey. He doesn't hold the hopes of the nation in quite the way his mother did in the more reverential 1950s.Not everyone was interested in this coronation. That's obvious.Central London was heaving with both British and foreign enthusiasts. Not even the rain was going to stop them enjoying themselves in their thousands.But Republican demonstrators also marched down Piccadilly as the service continued - with dozens arrested, which some accused of being heavy-handed.A recent poll for the BBC's Panorama programme suggests there is broad support for keeping the monarchy but below the headline figures it showed shifts in attitude - with some clear popularity challenges for the new king at the start of his reign, particularly with young people.And we've had three royal occasions in less than a year - the Platinum Jubilee, the Queen's funeral and now a coronation. There may be some fatigue.For many of us watching at home, Conservative MP Penny Mordaunt was the standout star. She carried the (exceptionally heavy-looking) Sword of State into the abbey as Lord President of the Privy Council, the first time a woman has performed that role in a coronation.She previously said she'd been doing press-ups to prepare.When she swapped it much later for the jewelled Sword of Offering, the nation breathed a sigh of relief.As, presumably, did her biceps.Penny Mordaunt's sword-wielding - and other top momentsHow people watched a day not seen for 70 yearsWhat it was really like inside the Abbey"

The political futures of both the Democratic president and Republican speaker may depend on winning the showdown, and it is unclear whether there is room for a compromise that could satisfy each of them.Yellen\u2019s letter may also go some way to sparking alarm on Wall Street about the situation after a period in which investors appeared sanguine that the perennially dysfunctional Congress would likely step back from the precipice at the last minute.The gulf between the parties remains massive. Republicans want Biden to make huge concessions on spending that would fundamentally reshape his legacy. They are using the debt ceiling crisis and the possibility of a financial catastrophe to try to get the spending cuts they hope could define their time in the majority.There is nothing wrong with Republicans using power won in a democratic election to fight for what they say they and their voters want \u2013 reductions to what they see as bloated federal spending and efforts to slow the growth of the national debt, which currently stands at more than $31 trillion. But the question they face is whether it is appropriate to use the prospect of fiscal Armageddon to advance a partisan goal.The president is refusing to cave into their demands. He insists Congress must pass a \u201cclean\u201d bill to raise the government\u2019s borrowing limit \u2013 a power only Congress has. He says he is willing to discuss spending \u2013 but only in the context of the yearly budget \u2013 a process the House GOP has barely started.Biden invites congressional leaders -- including McCarthy -- to meet May 9 on debt limitThe coming debt crisis represents the most acute moment yet in a period of divided government that will show whether Washington is able to overcome the country\u2019s political estrangement. The most sobering reality is that if the US tumbles off the debt cliff, it will be a self-inflicted disaster that would shatter America\u2019s reputation as a haven of financial stability that is critical in cementing Washington\u2019s global leadership.The debt ceiling needs to be raised because the government takes in less money in revenue than it spends. It is able to borrow money at excellent rates because it has a reputation of always paying its bills. Democrats point out that government borrowing authority needs to be raised since Congress is obligated to pay for spending that it has already approved. They also cite the fact that Republicans had no trouble doing so when former President Donald Trump was in office.With the moment of disaster approaching, the most worrying thing is that each side seems to believe that the prospect of the unthinkable will eventually force the other to blink to avoid being saddled with the blame. But there\u2019s no evidence yet either can or will.\u201cThis is not the way to do things, to hold the entire economy hostage to your political agenda,\u201d Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut told CNN\u2019s Wolf Blitzer on Monday. \u201cIt\u2019s juvenile. It\u2019s irresponsible. It\u2019s essentially political arson.\u201dBut South Carolina Republican Rep. Nancy Mace told CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper on \u201cThe Lead\u201d that \u201cthe president and the Senate ought to come to the table and work together with Republicans and make some decisions about how we move forward and take on spending and the debt.\u201dIt's time to worry about a US default. For real this timeMcCarthy heads a radical and tiny House majority that is cast in the disruptive image of Trump. A Republican wish-list bill, which raised the debt ceiling for a year in return for measures like expanding work requirements for Medicaid and cuts to climate change spending, squeezed through the House last week by the narrowest margin possible. Even if Biden were willing to negotiate, there\u2019s no guarantee McCarthy could pass any compromise that did not involve the president\u2019s utter capitulation. And if the California Republican tried to pass a less confrontational bill to shield the economy with the support of some Democrats, he could be ousted by his conference.Biden faces equally existential questions. Given that he is dealing with a Republican House that seems bent on an extreme path, he is likely to face calls in the coming days to show that he is the \u201cadult in the room\u201d and to make concessions in order to shield millions of Americans from harm. But in doing so, he\u2019d show weakness that would compromise his presidency and encourage Republicans to wield the nightmare scenario of a debt default again down the road. He may also demoralize Democratic voters he needs to support the reelection bid he launched last week.The administration\u2019s logic is that if hostage takers get concessions, they will demand more.Much will depend on whether Democrats in Congress stand firm behind the president amid growing concern about the political impact of the crisis. It also remains to be seen whether more moderate Republicans critical to the party defending its majority in 2024 begin to demand their own concessions and for McCarthy to stand up to hardliners.And ultimately, given that only Congress \u2013 and not the president \u2013 has the power to raise the debt ceiling, the fate of the country may rest on whether McCarthy is willing to risk his career and speakership to avert the worst consequences of this game of Russian roulette with the economy. Given that it took him 15 rounds of voting to win the speakership in January, which required multiple concessions to his party\u2019s most extreme members, that seems unlikely.So is there any hope that catastrophe can be avoided?\u201cI will take a bit of positive news out of this \u2013 they are talking, at least we have got that part going. For the last several months, they weren\u2019t even doing that,\u201d Jim Bianco, a financial analyst and president of Bianco Research, told CNN\u2019s Erin Burnett on Monday. But Bianco also warned that things are already not going well in an economy that did not need the shock of a debt default.The worry is that the May 9 meeting with Biden and McCarthy and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and Minority Leader Mitch McConnell will only entrench divides.The White House stressed on Monday that the meeting would focus on the need for a \u201cclean\u201d bill to raise the debt ceiling \u2013 signaling no shift toward McCarthy\u2019s position. The speaker reinforced his stand during a trip to Israel that he used to goad the president.\u201cHouse Republicans did their job and passed a responsible bill that raises the debt ceiling, avoids default, and tackles reckless spending,\u201d he said in a statement on Monday. \u201cMeanwhile, President Biden has refused to do his job \u2014 threatening to bumble our nation into its first ever default \u2014 and the clock is ticking.\u201dThis is the kind of pre-game positioning expected ahead of a tough negotiation and is similar to that which preceded a deal that narrowly averted a debt default in 2011 between then-House Speaker John Boehner and then-President Barack Obama. But even though fiscal disaster was averted that time, the US did lose the top-level credit rating awarded by ratings agency S&P, which raised US borrowing costs for years afterward. More than a decade on, the bitterness between the parties is deeper and the GOP has marched far to the right, making the possibility of a compromise even more questionable. Some members of the GOP House majority \u2013 in which McCarthy can only lose four votes and still pass a bill \u2013 have said they will never vote to raise the debt ceiling.In more normal circumstances, it would be possible to see a way out of the situation. In a classic Washington fudge, Biden could agree to curbs on spending in a budget negotiated with Republican leaders in the House that could then get through the Senate. Republican House members could argue that they had beaten Biden as cover for passing a \u201cclean\u201d bill raising the debt ceiling. The president could allow McCarthy that symbolic victory in return for getting new government borrowing authority that would spare the country and the world the impact of a debt default.But such an outcome would require trust between the parties, a functioning relationship between McCarthy and Biden, courageous leadership and a willingness from lawmakers in both parties to cast tough votes that could come back to haunt them in primary races. None of these qualities appear in ready supply in Washington in an age of increasing polarization.The debt ceiling will have to be raised eventually. But it\u2019s growing increasingly hard to see how it could happen without some of the consequences of a default playing out to show both sides the severity of the political costs that subsequent misery could cause Americans.Senate Minority Whip John Thune told reporters that Monday\u2019s developments only underscored the need for Biden and McCarthy to get to work.\u201cTime\u2019s a-wasting,\u201d the South Dakota Republican said."

        "text": "There is yin and yang to accountability for the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol.Pushing toward justice, some ofthe people who planned and conducted the riot are going to jail for theserious crime ofseditious conspiracy. And the universe of people convicted for trying to undermine the 2020election grows.Pulling in another direction, former President Donald Trump,the person who inspired the Capitol riot and tried to undo the election, is growing stronger as theto be the Republican nominee for president next year.If you\u2019re wondering how it would be possible for the federal government to prosecute the person who is, you\u2019ve hit on the unanswerable and unprecedented question that could cause so much chaos as the republic prepares to consider transferring power again.The Department of Justice has moved methodically but very slowly as it bringsincreasingly serious cases against riot ringleaders.That means that as special counselconsiders what, if any, charges the government should bring against Trump for events surrounding the 2020 election, he will have to contend with the reality of the former president\u2019spolitical power.Most Republicans \u2013\u2013 would consider Trump as their nominee; should they have that right to vote him into office in a free republic? Or should charges, if they are warranted, be brought anyway, even years after the fact?There was not enough political support to bar Trump from office through an impeachment trial when he was president. Would things be different in a criminal trial?Juries have shown a willingness to find people guilty of the complicated and hard-to-prove charges related to January 6. Four leaders of the far-right group Proud Boys were found guilty Thursday of seditious conspiracy in connection with the January 6 insurrection.They join five members and one associate of another far-right militia group, the Oath Keepers, found guilty by DC juries of the same charge in separate cases resolved lastand this.None of these convicts have yet been sentenced, but they could face decades in prison.The conspiracy portion of their crimes did not necessarily involve action on January 6, 2021. The Proud Boys leader Enrique Tarrio was not even in DC on January 6; he had been ordered to leave town after being arrested with high-capacity rifle magazines twodays before.A fifth Proud Boys defendant, Dominic Pezzola, who used a stolenpolice shield to break through a window at the Capitol, was found not guilty of seditious conspiracy, but was convicted, along with the other four Proud Boys, of other charges.The following insightscome from CNN\u2019s report by Hannah Rabinowitz and Holmes Lybrand on.I asked CNN\u2019s Marshall Cohen what we know about the universe of people charged and convicted for involvement in January 6. Combining data from the Justice Department and CNN, he offered this:The charges so far have focused on the riot and its planning rather than the inspiration Trump providedto stop the counting of electoral votes and his effort to overturn the election. The investigation into Trump, led by Smith, is still underway.The major development on that front is that former Vice President Mike Pence, a potential Trump rival for the 2024 GOP nomination, sat for hours of testimony before a grand jury in Washington.Smith attended that testimony in person, according toon the development from Kristen Holmes, Jamie Gangel and Katelyn Polantz.From the CNN report:Trump clearly has other legal problems too. Smith is also investigating the mishandling of classified documents found at the former president\u2019sMar-a-Lago resort (President Joe Biden is the subject of a separate inquiry related to classified documents). And Trump is under indictment in New York for charges related to alleged hush-money payments that date back tothe 2016 presidential election.Rather than wound his political prospects, however, none of these developments have led Republican voters to move on. At least not yet."

        "text": "Old guard political leaders are defying one of America\u2019s fabled political rites \u2013 the passing of a torch to a new generation. And some voters and those keen to assume power are frustrated.Theand the extent to which voters should try to judge politicians\u2019 mental cognition \u2013 and whether it should disqualify someone from public office \u2013 are boiling up as the 2024 election season gets underway.There\u2019s never been an election like it., who is the oldest-ever president at 80, just launched a bid for reelection., the frontrunner in the Republican nominating race, would be 82 by the end of a non-consecutive second term. The advanced age of both men is doing nothing to quell their ambition and their mutual antipathy after 2020\u2019s bitter campaign. But it also poses risks for both parties and has fueled calls that it\u2019s time to move on from a pair born in the 1940s.AOC says Feinstein should resign, won't primary Gillibrand in 2024The specter of octogenarian commanders in chief is not the only age-related political flap. There was fresh speculation on Tuesday about the future of 89-year-old California Sen. Dianne Feinstein, whose weekslong absence from Washington as she recovers from shingles has jammed up judicial nominations and drained power from the Democratic Senate majority. And Republican Senate leaderfrom his own convalescence after suffering a fall soon after turning 81. Only Nancy Pelosi, the longtime House speaker, recently heeded time\u2019s call afterfrom Democratic leadership.The rising questions about age spring from a number of building political forces \u2013 most obviously the longevity and unslaked ambition of some of the nation\u2019s top leaders. Their prominence is all the more relevant in a polarized and narrowly divided government, where even a small shift in power can create wild shifts in the nation\u2019s political direction. Democrats are still traumatized, for instance, by the death ofin 2020, which allowed then-President Trump to cement an unassailable conservative Supreme Court majority that may last for years.In a similar way, a major health crisis for Biden or Trump, if he is the Republican nominee, late in the 2024 campaign could cause extraordinary political shockwaves. Many Democrats in Washington admit privately they\u2019re nervous about the possibility. Others worry about the split screen comparison between an aged Biden and a younger GOP nominee if it\u2019s not Trump. And Republicans clearly believe that Vice President Kamala Harris is an electoral liability for Democrats and are stressing that she\u2019s a heartbeat away from the top job.The debate over age also reflects the coarse nature of today\u2019s political discourse, at a moment when the long-time standards of decorum and respect for the presidency and elder statesmen and women have eroded.Republican presidential candidate Nikki Haley, for instance, implied that it was \u201cnot likely\u201d that the president would make it to 86 \u2013 the age he would be at the end of a second term. In an appearance on Fox News on Tuesday, the former South Carolina governor said that Biden \u201cdidn\u2019t even know where he was the week before\u201d and couldn\u2019t specify how many grandchildren he had. (Her claims that Biden is unfit to serve are not backed up by any medical evidence.)Haley, 51, is calling forfor presidential candidates and other politicians over age 75 \u2013 a threshold that would conveniently include Trump. Her attacks on Biden also seem like a way to get attention for her campaign, which starts at a huge disadvantage against Trump.Republicans ramp up attacks on transgender people, in statehouses and on the campaign trailMeanwhile,\u2013 often viewed as a standard bearer for a new generation of Democrats \u2013 on Tuesday hardened calls for Feinstein to resign. The 33-year-old New York congresswoman argued that the senator\u2019s absence meant her party couldn\u2019t push more judges through the Senate at a time when abortion rights are being fought for in the courts.\u201cHer refusal to either retire or show up is causing great harm to the judiciary \u2013 precisely where repro rights are getting stripped. That failure means now, in this precious window, Dems can only pass GOP-approved nominees,\u201d Ocasio-Cortez posted on Bluesky, a new social media app.Feinstein\u2019s Democratic colleagues have mostly defended her despite rising frustration over her absence \u2013 partly owing to the great respect in which she\u2019s held in the Senate, which is still a more courtly institution than most in US politics.Rhode Island Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse suggested that if she retired, Republican obstruction tactics would prevent Democrats from replacing her on the Judiciary Committee. \u201cThe problem only goes away when she comes back and sits in that seat and votes again,\u201d Whitehouse told CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper. Feinstein had asked to be \u201ctemporarily\u201d replaced on the panel in April, butsuch a request from Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer.Some GOP senators have been defending Feinstein staying in office, though her absence while holding on to the seat coincides with the political goal of blocking or slowing the confirmation process for Biden nominees.Republican Chuck Grassley of Iowa, who at age 89 is the second oldest member of the Senate, told CNN on Wednesday that Democrats should leave Feinstein alone after attacking her for years.\u201cThey\u2019re picking on somebody that\u2019s older, and it just doesn\u2019t show the proper respect for somebody that has been serving in the Senate for 24 years, maybe 30 years,\u201d said Grassley who was reelected to another six-year term last year. \u201cSo let\u2019s just leave it this way. They should leave her alone. She\u2019s sick. She needs to get well so she can get back to work.\u201dIt\u2019s not unusual for questions about the health of senators to get attention in Washington considering their prolonged tenures. Segregationist Strom Thurmond was wheeled around the Senate and died at 100 in 2003 \u2013 a few months after retiring as a Republican senator from South Carolina. West Virginia Democratic Sen. Robert Byrd was still serving when he died in 2010 at 92. The comparison between the treatment of Feinstein and these two old Senate bulls has led to accusations of sexism. There may be something to this. But pressure on the California senator is worsened by the slim balance of power between the parties. And if she doesn\u2019t return soon, her absence could hamper Democrats not just over judges, but in a debt ceiling showdown with Republicans in the coming weeks.Feinstein, a pioneer female politician, has been fighting a case of shingles in recent weeks, according to her staff. But she has also faced questions about her mental faculties in recent years.at his weekly press conference on Tuesday, captured in a photo, suggested that he expected her back in the chamber as soon as next week, though he did not voice that view. A spokesperson for Feinstein said she was making progress but there was no timeline for when her doctors would judge it safe for her to return to Washington.Questions about Biden and age will only get more oppressive in a campaign in which the president will be under pressure to constantly demonstrate energy, sharp wits and that he is up to the huge pressures of his job. While Biden\u2019s physicians have certified that his health shows he is fit to fulfill his duties, the risks of some kind of adverse health event obviously rise with age.Like most presidents, he has clearly aged in office. And his frequent verbal gaffes and moments when he appears to lose his train of thought only play into assaults by Republicans who argue he\u2019s not fit to serve. Biden, however, has had a reputation for putting his foot in his mouth long before he became a senior, back to when he was a loquacious senator from Delaware.Schumer's notes say Feinstein 'hopeful' to return to Senate next weekThe classic argument about old presidents is that these are the people who hold the nuclear codes; they need all their mental faculties. It was made against President Ronald Reagan, who left office at age 77 ahead of a later diagnosis with Alzheimer\u2019s.Concerns about age are not an invention of the media or Republicans. Many Americans are very worried about it. Anreleased last week showed that 70% of Americans didn\u2019t want Biden to run again \u2013 and half of those said that age was a \u201cmajor\u201d reason.Despite this obvious vulnerability, the president stumbled somewhat over a question about his age during a rare press conference last week before assuring Americans he had carefully considered all the implications.\u201cWith regard to age, I can\u2019t even say \u2013 if I guess how old I am, I can\u2019t even say the number. It doesn\u2019t \u2013 it doesn\u2019t register with me,\u201d Biden told reporters. \u201cThe only thing I can say is that one of the things that people are going to find out \u2013 they\u2019re going to see a race, and they\u2019re going to judge whether or not I have it or don\u2019t have it. I respect them taking a hard look at it. I\u2019d take a hard look at it as well. I took a hard look at it before I decided to run.\u201dBy the weekend, Biden used the White House Correspondents\u2019 Association Dinner to try to defuse the age questions by joking about his old friend and founder \u201cJimmy Madison.\u201d But it\u2019s going to be an issue for him all the way until November 2024, not least because Trump has raised questions about Biden\u2019s mental capacity ever since running against him in 2020.It\u2019s fair to ask, however, why Trump \u2013 who turns 77 next month \u2013 is not facing similar questions. While Biden seems to have lost a step, the wild, erratic and dangerous decision making of a president who refused to accept his loss and incited a mob attack on Congress seems to pose equal questions of mental acuity and temperament."

        "link": "https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/03/politics/san-francisco-crime-rate-what-matters/index.html",
        "text": "Another big American retailer announced it was pulling out of downtown San Francisco.and the \u201cdynamics of thedowntown San Francisco market\u201dwhen it announced it would not renew the lease on its massive retail location as well as its discount outletin the heart of the city.Numerous other brands have also said they will pull out of the area. In April,a flagship store that opened just last year, citing worker safety.What\u2019s happening in San Francisco has become a key storyline in a larger national narrativeabout crime and perceptions of crime.It\u2019s a storyline that CNN reporter Kyung Lah experienced back in March when she and a crew went to San Francisco to report on how crime has scrambled the city\u2019s politics. Last November, voters in the majority-Asian American Sunset District replaced a progressive Chinese American incumbent for supervisor with a moderate White man, Joel Engardio.\u201cSan Francisco, the most liberal place in America, is saying enough. We want safe streets. We want good schools,\u201d Engardio told Lah during an interview at City Hall. \u201cThat should tell anyone \u2013 pay attention.\u201dProving the point, the window of the car rented by Lah and her crew was being smashed and their bags grabbed as she conducted that interview. It happened in about four seconds, Lah said, and despite the fact that the CNN crew had hired professional security to watch their car..Lah told me officers from the San Francisco Police Department ultimately recovered her emptied bags and passport.For a better sense of what exactly is going on in one of the world\u2019s great cities, I talked to Joe Eskenazi, managing editor and columnist for, an independent, nonprofit news site. Full disclosure: Joe and I went to college together in the Bay Area and were colleagues at The Daily Californian. Excerpts of our conversation are below.There is crime in downtown San Francisco, but there always has been.I think the notion that these businesses were driven out by crime is frankly dishonest. That\u2019s always been a factor. But it wasn\u2019t like Mid-Market (where the Nordstrom is located) was a serene place before the pandemic.I think the Nordstrom people were very responsible in what they said. The letter that was sent to everybody was very upfront that there was decreased foot traffic. They weren\u2019t making money.It wasn\u2019t good business for them anymore. And Nordstrom, in fact, closed their Stonestown Mall outlet in 2019, which is a mall more in the periphery of San Francisco.So the problem here is that your big, high-end, mall-type retail is dying. It was already having lots of trouble before the pandemic and that kind of greased the skids. That\u2019s a big problem for downtown San Francisco. It\u2019s hundreds of thousands of square feet of retail space that\u2019s suddenly going to go vacant.To say it was chased out by crime is a preferred narrative of people for their own worldview.I just looked back and found an article thatabout complaints that one out of every four police calls in that district was in or near the Westfield Mall. That was there before.That\u2019s true, but that doesn\u2019t have anything to do with crime. That has to do with the fact that the entire inside of the city was devoted to office space for businesses that are now going remote and cutting down.People have different opinions on this, but I feel like it\u2019s kind of asking a lot for the city to have 2020 hindsight. You can see where the city made itself vulnerable, devoting so much space to office space exclusively.And in this case, tech companies were so flush that they alone could afford to buy up that office space, and in fact bought it up when it was still even conceptual office space. So like 100% of the vacancies were going to tech.When tech workers dictated that they would rather be working from home or working a combination, that\u2019s what happened. If you go to the Financial District now \u2013 it\u2019s not nearly as bad as everyone would think. There are still people around. It\u2019s just not crowded. And it hollows out very quickly once working hours are done.But that\u2019s always how it was. I think office vacanciesspeak for themselves.We\u2019re going to see how bad it really is when rents come down. A lot of the people who own those buildings are extremely leveraged and can\u2019t afford to lower rents. So rents are still higher than in other cities nearby and in competing cities.You\u2019re not going to get new people with those rates. Sooner or later people are going to have to bite the bullet and decide they want the building to be largely full at a lower rate or largely empty at a higher rate.And then we\u2019re going to see if other types of businesses move in \u2013 the types of businessesSan Francisco economically banished a long time ago.There have always been large numbers of unhoused people in San Francisco. The difference now is that with fewer people downtown, a higher percentage of people you see are visibly homeless.What\u2019s more, there are more overtly miserable people out than there used to be, for lack of a better word. You\u2019re seeing more chaotic, horrific conditions.You earlier mentioned crime, and in people\u2019s minds, being uneasy about drug use in the streets or antisocial behavior is equated in their minds with crime. People feel uneasy, and that\u2019s understandable.But this feeling of uneasiness does not square with crime. If you take a step back, statistically, that\u2019s the case. San Francisco has lots of overt misery, lots of overt drug use, lots of things that you wish you didn\u2019t see and that the city should be dealing with in ways other than tossing people in jail or pushing them into neighboring counties.San Francisco also has lots of property crime because there\u2019s a great divergence of wealth and people steal things. But San Francisco\u2019s violent crime rate is at a near historic low right now.This dynamic was on full display when it was just assumed thatwas stabbed to death by a homeless crazy, and it turns out that the man in custody is a fellow tech executive.We have a big problem with the future of downtown and how it\u2019s going to be productive and provide the tax revenue that this city depends upon. The departures of our big anchor businesses because it\u2019s no longer profitable \u2013 that\u2019s a big problem. It is separate and apart from the perception that it\u2019s \u201cMad Max Beyond Thunderdome\u201d here on the city streets, which just really isn\u2019t true.I think it\u2019s definitely going to have its effect on how things are done in San Francisco, but we\u2019re going to have to see what that looks like.I\u2019d say that half-formed \u201csolutions\u201d meant to address something that isn\u2019t statistically a problem are not going to have happy outcomes. You know, calling in the Highway Patrol and the National Guard to deal with our horrible drug addiction problem isn\u2019t going to do much if it\u2019s all for show, even if they get out on the streets and start collaring drug users and tossing them in jail.We\u2019re currently arresting narcotics criminals at about one-ninth of volume that district attorney (now Vice President) Kamala Harris presided over during prior police administrations. The tough parts of downtown were still tough back then. There was still a lot of overt drug use and misery.The drugs are different now. The drugs are more dangerous now. But it would be very hard to just patrol and arrest your way out of this problem. It\u2019s going to take more thorough, complete solutions.I\u2019m not really even seeing the willingness to have honest discussions about this, because the whole premise is being taken and grabbed and run with in a dishonest way.I think that people are scared and people are uneasy and people are fed up.But that\u2019s different than saying OK, we\u2019re just gonna hire more cops or OK, we\u2019re going to just do something simple. These are complicated problems. And San Francisco can\u2019t solve some of America\u2019s problems.One of the reasons in San Francisco you see people shooting drugs on the street is because in other parts of the country, those people can afford to be inside.San Francisco has land-use issues and housing issues. Land use is a bit like sand; it gets into everything here. Every discussion ends up coming back to that, which is very unsatisfactory and makes it very hard to solve problems.A (former New York City Mayor Rudy) Giuliani type situation of just like booting misery and overt antisocial behavior into the next county isn\u2019t going to end up working here, because it would seem that other people have that idea elsewhere and they encourage people to come here.I think Kamala Harris will rise or fall based upon factors other than her performance as district attorney in San Francisco quite some time ago.I think that it\u2019s very hard to see some of Gavin Newsom\u2019s moves here in Californiaasother than politically based. Gavin Newsom does not seem to want to give fodder to (Florida Gov.) Ron DeSantis and, as a result, something that we know would work here in California, which is having supervised drug use centers \u2013 which have worked elsewhere in the country and worked elsewhere in the world \u2013.So we\u2019re left with doing the same thing we\u2019ve always done with regard to drug users and drug addicted people, which is not much \u2013 and the death toll is staggering.I have a hard time seeing that as anything other than a politically based move. And he didn\u2019t give Ron DeSantis something to tease him about, and people are dead on the streets. It\u2019s very frustrating for those of us who live here.It\u2019s different. Some things are better, and some things are worse. People who tell you differently areseeing things through blinders, frankly. Full disclosure: You and I went to college together, and I grew up in the area. After Berkeley, I ended up moving full time to San Francisco 20 some odd years ago.When I moved to San Francisco, Zach, there were well over 100 murders a year.We\u2019ve had as few as, I think, two years ago (note: it was 2019). We\u2019re on pace to have about 56, 55. So it\u2019s very different. Violent crime is much lower now than it was 20 years ago, 10 years ago.But property crime is off the hook. And overt misery is off the hook. And the budget of San Francisco has ballooned. So people are frustrated.But simply saying things are worse or things are better strikes me as being reductive. Things are certainly more expensive."

        "name": "Why the US expects a border surge and is deploying troops",
        "link": "https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/02/politics/title-42-border-what-matters/index.html",
        "text": "The layer of duct tape that has been holding up US immigration policy will be ripped off, and nobody seems completely ready for what\u2019s next:The surge of migrants is expected because Title 42, the Trump-era policy that allowed the government to quickly turn away certain migrants at the border during the Covid-19 pandemic, is expiring.It was kept in place by courts and used by the Biden administration.Title 42 officially ends on May 11, when the Covid-19 public health emergency lapses.Encounters between US border agents and undocumented immigrants had fallen early this year but have recently increased. They are at around 7,000 per day at the moment and are expected to rise dramatically, despite a warning from the State Department and DHS about a new, more punitive policy related to border crossings.The additional 1,500 active-duty troops being dispatched for 90 days by the Pentagon will join around 2,500 National Guard troops already on the border. They are meant to act in strictly administrative roles and not to aid in law enforcement,.These deployments are not unprecedented in recent years, but this one is notable since it coincides with an expected surge of border encounters.The administration has tried to discourage migrants from simply crossing the border and promised that people apprehended will be turned away and potentially barred from reentry.The US is working with Colombia and Guatemala to set up regional processing centers to allow migrants to apply to come to the US before they attempt the grueling journey through Central America and Mexico.\u201cThe idea is, of course, that people will not continue their journey over land,\u201d a senior administration officialrecently. \u201cThe whole idea of regional processing centers is to give people a lawful, safe, regular way to enter the United States.\u201dBut there are already more than 36,000 migrants, according to estimates, camped along the border in northern Mexico waiting for the end of Title 42.The State Department and DHS haveto use a mobile app to make an appointment at a port of entry rather than trying to cross the border.Once Title 42 lapses, the US will return to using what\u2019s known as Title 8 authority to remove anyone who arrives at the border unlawfully and bar them from reentering the US for at least five years, a more punitive approach.A major difference after Title 42 lapses is that asylum-seekers who cross the border without first applying for asylum will be removed under that Title 8 authority, along with a newly proposed regulation, according to the State Department. Immigration advocates are confounded since the Trump administration.The government has pledged to increase the number of refugees allowed into the US and is pushing applicants to use those regional centers rather than travel all the way to the border.There are also asylum-seekers already inside the US.CNN\u2019s Rosa Flores recently reported from the streets of El Paso, Texas, where crowds of people had been moved from sleeping on the street to make way for a twice-daily run-through by the city\u2019s sanitation services. El Paso has declared a state of emergency in anticipation of the end of Title 42.Flores said it\u2019s mostly men sleeping on the street and that families with children are crowding shelters that have been set up in the city.From border towns, asylum-seekers hope to get a ride closer to relatives or acquaintances who live in the country.CNN recently talked to a Haitian family \u2013 28-year-old Dieuvena, her husband Banel and their 4-year-old son Mat\u00e9o Sebastien \u2013 struggling to. After staying in a hospital, the family has had a hard time finding a place to sleep.Texas has been transporting thousands of migrants to cities like New York, Chicago and Washington, DC.New York City Mayor Eric Adams has asked the federal government to stop giving Federal Emergency Management Agency funds to the Texas border cities using federal dollars to rent buses and ship migrants farther north.More than 50,000 asylum-seekers have arrived since last spring, according to.They wrote:Adams also accused Texas Gov. Greg Abbott of only sending migrants to cities with Black mayors.\u201cGovernor Abbott sent asylum seekers to NY \u2013 Black mayor; to Washington \u2013 Black mayor; to Houston \u2013 Black mayor; to Los Angeles \u2013 Black mayor; to Denver \u2013 Black mayor. He passed over thousands of cities to land here,\u201d Adams said at a recent news conference on an unrelated topic.\u201cI cannot ignore the fact that Gov. Abbott sent migrants only to cities where there are Black mayors, and it\u2019s undermining our cities,\u201d he added.Abbott, unapologetic for targeting certain cities that pledged to be immigrant sanctuaries with busloads of migrants, has argued the larger problem is on the border.The men both want help from the federal government, but they have very different ideas about what that help would look like.Adams wants the federal government to help deal with asylum-seekers already in the US in a more orderly and fair way. Abbott wants the federal government to repel people at the border.There\u2019s a larger point here: Current immigration policy is about to change in a material way not because a reasoned debate led to legislation \u2013 Congress is not seriously debating immigration at the moment \u2013 but rather because the public health emergency is officially ending.One thing that would help the immigration policy is clarity, according to Ariel Ruiz Soto, an analyst at the Migration Policy Institute.\u201cClearly there\u2019s significant policy change that is needed at the US-Mexico border; one that actually starts with increasing and providing better assistance for US asylum claims, one that is more fair and transparent about who can come to the country and seek asylum in which ways,\u201d he.There\u2019s also very clearly a need for better coordination between the local, state and federal governments about how to treat people already in the US.It\u2019s a great irony of the US political debate that immigration drives such a visceral divide since the country\u2013 both to address labor shortages and to shore up the social safety net programs that are running out of funding."

        "link": "https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/08/politics/gun-immigration-politics-texas/index.html",
        "text": "The national season of violence deepened withthat hit two of the rawest political divides, guns and immigration.Horrific eye-witness testimony isat an outlet mall in affluent Allen, Texas, where on Saturday afternoon a gunman armed with an AR-15-style rifle sprayed shoppers with bullets, killing eight people. It was the latest in a string of mass shootings in Texas and across the country that have killed many innocent people but have brought no action to end the cycle of loss.Then, on Sunday, a driverwaiting at a bus stop outside a shelter in the Texas border town of Brownsville. At least eight people were killed and close to a dozen injured. It was not clear whether the incident was an accident or intentional. In either case, the tragedy focused fresh attention on the plight of migrants and the controversy over their future.The tragedies were unrelated. But both moments of aching sorrow took place against a backdrop of two of the nation\u2019s most divisive issues, both of which are especially acute in Texas and which fractured national politics has failed to fix \u2013 mass shootings and a border crisis.Texas mall massacre gunman identified as witnesses describe horror of the shooting spree that killed 8 peopleSuspicion of government runs hot in the Lone Star State. But it\u2019s also an epicenter of an emerging political struggle between deeply conservative Republican leaders drawing power from rural areas and more liberal cities. It often appears to exemplify the extremes of American life. It has also had the misfortune of suffering a sequence of shootings, including in a school in Uvalde last year, a Walmart shopping center inand a church in Sutherland Springs in 2017. Just last week, Texans were shocked by a mass shooting by a gunman who killed five people in Cleveland, which started when neighbors complained about a man firing a weapon in his yard.Texas is also expected to be at the center of a different political storm this week with the expiration on Thursday of the Covid-era border restriction that has enabled the US to swiftly expel certain migrants. The anticipated end of the policy, which has been the primary border enforcement tool since March 2020, has already led to an influx of migrants, with fears about a surge after it\u2019s lifted. Republican warnings of a foreign invasion by undocumented migrants have deepened a political vulnerability for President Joe Biden as the administration has struggled to counter claims of a border crisis.But as in the case of mass shootings, there is little chance that the nation\u2019s polarized politics will ease in order to offer the space for meaningful resolution. Comprehensive immigration reform failed several times under Republican and Democratic presidents and there is little agreement between or within the parties on how to mitigate the situation at a time when crime, violence and economic blight are exacerbating migrant flows from Central America toward the southern border.The weekend put a spotlight on Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, who has been criticized for mentioning the undocumented status of some victims of the Cleveland massacre, as well as his blessing for loosening lax gun laws. The Republican governor has also played a key role in politicizing the debate over migration, including by shipping migrants to liberal areas.Abbott told Fox on Sunday that he was heading to Allen to offer condolences to bereaved families and posed a series of questions he said families wanted answered: \u201cWhy did this happen? Why did the gunman do this? How did this happen?\u201dRather than considering the availability of guns, he appeared to suggest that some kind of deficiency in the national spirit amid increasing \u201canger and violence\u201d might be to blame. \u201cWe have got to find a way in this country where we can once again reunite Americans \u2026 and come together as one big family,\u201d Abbott said. \u201cAnd in that regard, find ways to reduce violence in our country.\u201dBut Democrats in Texas reacted to Saturday\u2019s shooting by slamming Abbott for doing nothing to stop the killing sprees on his watch. State Rep. Trey Martinez Fischer warned in a statement that it was \u201ca choice to allow this nightmare of gun violence to continue.\u201d\u201cAn elementary school. A military base. A college. A theater. A church. A Walmart. A high school. And now a shopping outlet. House Democrats grieve today. We grieve for those families who lost loved ones in Allen, but we also grieve for all of our children that have to live in a state where they constantly live under the fear of being shot and killed.\u201dBiden also noted that the killer in Allen used the kind of AR-15-style weapon that he would like to see outlawed. \u201cWe need more action, faster, to save lives,\u201d Biden wrote on Twitter.Democratic state Sen. Roland Guttierrez, who represents Uvalde, told CNN that \u201cour state is burning down because we have these guns in the hands of people that shouldn\u2019t have them.\u201dBut several Republicans, including Abbott, sought to use the proliferation of mass shootings to argue they were as much of a problem in Democratic states, where gun laws are often more strict, as in conservative ones were state legislatures are working to weaken firearms laws.US Rep. Henry Cuellar, one of the most conservative Democrats in Congress, told Fox that \u201cpeople talk about just making the laws stricter. In states that are blue, very strict laws, you still get this type of mass shooting, so it does happen across the nation and we have to get to the bottom of this.\u201dThere have been mass shootings in Democratic-run states like Michigan and California. Still, a study published last year by Everytown for Gun Safety, a nonprofit organization that focuses on gun violence prevention, found a direct correlation between states with weaker gun laws and higher rates of gun deaths, including homicides, suicides and accidental killings.The latest mass shooting in Texas came after a spree of such killings in schools, supermarkets, at community parades, a bank and places of worship nationwide. It happened with the country still processing a shooting at a medical facility in Atlanta last week that killed one woman and injured four others. There have been 200 mass shootings in the US so far this year just within the first five months of this year, according to the Gun Violence Archive, which, like CNN, defines a mass shooting as one in which four or more people are shot, excluding the shooter.In the incident in Brownsville, which is close to the Rio Grande, police responded to a call around 8:30 am CT about a Land Rover that hit multiple people at a bus stop across the street from the Bishop Enrique San Pedro Ozanam Center, a nonprofit homeless shelter that has been helping house migrants.Details were still being assembled late on Sunday night. The driver, identified as a Hispanic man, is being \u201cuncooperative\u201d with authorities, according to officials, and had given multiple names. Witnesses described seeing the driver ignore a red light, drive up on a curb and run over a group of people waiting at the bus stop. The shelter has been housing immigrants while they wait for more permanent housing.But even though investigators are still unsure whether the crash was deliberate, one Democrat accused Republicans of fostering an environment that made migrants vulnerable.\u201cWhile the incident is still under investigation, there is no doubt that our state\u2019s leaders are painting a target on migrants\u2019 backs,\u201d said Texas Democratic Party Chairman Gilberto Hinojosa.New controversy over migrants in Texas comes with the White House under heavy criticism from Republicans over border issues \u2013 an issue that has long caused political headaches for Biden, who just launched his 2024 reelection race.The expiration of Title 42 will mean that border authorities will have to return to decades-old protocols at a time of unprecedented mass migration in the Western hemisphere. The consequences are likely to further strain the already brittle relationship between the Biden White House and the Abbott administration in Austin, which leaves little hope for cooperation between them."

It\u2019s also fundamental to the historical accounting still unfolding over one of the most flagrant attacks on American democracy and may go some way to undermining Republican efforts to blur the truth of what happened on that terrible day.Four Proud Boys members found guilty of seditious conspiracyBut the legal uncertainty facing Trump \u2013 who appears in jeopardy inspringing from his election denialism and other alleged transgressions \u2013 comes with a related political question. Even if the ex-president is charged with trying to overthrow the core principle of democracy \u2013 the peaceful transfer of power \u2013 will it ultimately hurt his 2024 campaign?The former president is betting that it won\u2019t. He\u2019s spent two years denying the truth of January 6 and has anchored his 2024 campaign for a non-consecutive second term to the premise that he was illegally ousted from power in 2020. If the nascent Republican nominating contest is any guide, Trump\u2019s legacy of disgrace is unlikely to scare off Republican primary voters, many of whom seem to be warming to him after his slow start. And that\u2019s despite his indictment in a hush money case in New York. (He\u2019s pleaded not guilty to charges of falsifying business records.), however, has made a counter bet. The first scene of his reelection announcement video released last month showed smoke rising over the US Capitol and rioters with Trump flags. Whatever the liabilities of his own bid, including his advanced age, low approval ratings and an unpredictable economy, the current commander in chief is beseeching Americans not to trust their democracy to a predecessor who came close to overturning it in early 2021.Given the fraught situation, the Justice Department\u2019s next moves will be hugely significant.\u201cToday\u2019s verdict makes clear the Justice Department will do everything in its power to defend the American people and American democracy,\u201d Attorney General Merrick Garland said after prosecutors secured convictions against the Proud Boys extremists in a historic case Thursday.But Garland walked away from the cameras and didn\u2019t take a question \u2013 presumably because he\u2019s not yet ready to answer the one that is on the nation\u2019s lips, about Trump.In cases directly related to the 2020 election, the former president is being investigated by special counsel Jack Smith over his actions running up to the insurrection. He\u2019s also waiting to find out whether he and his political cronies will be charged in an investigation in Fulton County, Georgia, over his attempt to steal Biden\u2019s victory in the Peach State.Thursday\u2019s Proud Boys convictions are among the most significant of hundreds of successful Justice Department prosecutions of people linked to the US Capitol riot. Five leaders and one associate of another extremist group \u2013 the Oath Keepers \u2013 were earlier found guilty of seditious conspiracy in separate cases. All of those convicted potentially face decades in jail. Nearly 600 rioters have been convicted and more than 235 have been sent to prison on lesser charges.How 2020 election accountability could hit a 2024 roadblockThis record bolsters Garland\u2019s promise that the assault on US democracy would be punished. But it also begs the question why Trump, who inspired the rioters and has convinced millions of his supporters that he actually won an election he lost, has not faced similar accountability.\u201cWho is the single most powerful person who Merrick Garland has charged in connection with January 6? Nobody,\u201d said CNN legal analyst Elie Honig on Thursday, channeling frustration among some experts with the slow pace of investigations into Trump and his associates.So could the ex-president \u2013 who called a crowd to Washington on the day that the 2020 election was due to be certified in Congress, fired supporters up with lies about election fraud and told them to \u201cfight like hell\u201d before they marched on the Capitol \u2013 also be charged? And since prosecutors referred to the Proud Boys convicted on Thursday as \u201cTrump\u2019s army\u201d and said that they appeared to see him as their leader and his rhetoric as a call to action, could he also be looking at a charge as serious as seditious conspiracy?\u201cDonald Trump lit the flame. The Proud Boys were the flame,\u201d former Rep. Adam Kinzinger, an Illinois Republican, told CNN\u2019s Wolf Blitzer on \u201cThe Situation Room.\u201dSeditious conspiracy, a charge that dates from the post-Civil War period, is rarely used and hard to prove. Prosecutors effectively had to show that two or more people had conspired to overthrow, put down or destroy by force the US government. They used a trove of text messages, video and other material to build the chain of conspiracy that convinced the jury.Using the same charge against Trump would be complicated unless the special counsel has amassed evidence that shows that the ex-president genuinely plotted with others to incite violence against the government when his vice president was inside the Capitol presiding over the certification of Biden\u2019s victory. It won\u2019t be enough to simply draw a line between Trump\u2019s apparent incitement of the crowd to events that happened next.\u201cThe challenge whenever you are establishing a conspiracy is you have to have an agreement between two parties,\u201d CNN legal analyst Elliot Williams said. \u201cFinding an agreement between the former president and the people who were there on that day is just going to be exceptionally difficult.\u201dStill, the defendants found guilty of seditious conspiracy on Thursday \u2013 longtime Proud Boys chairman Enrique Tarrio, Ethan Nordean, Joseph Biggs and Zachary Rehl \u2013 were also found guilty of a range of other charges, including three separate conspiracy charges, obstructing the Electoral College vote and tampering with evidence. So while a prosecution of Trump and his closest political associates over January 6 could be tough, it may not be impossible. In fact, Tarrio was not even on the Capitol grounds when the insurrection took place \u2013 a fact that could chill those in Trump\u2019s camp.A lawyer for Rehl told CNN\u2019s Katelyn Polantz after the verdict that what Trump did or didn\u2019t do was of \u201cno moment\u201d to her or her client. She added, however: \u201cBut he was the one who called the rally and had everyone show up.\u201dAny legal moves will take place in a highly sensitive political context. After all, the next election is unfolding while a former president and current presidential candidate is being investigated over alleged crimes by the Justice Department of his successor\u2019s administration.The lesson of the ex-president\u2019s career in business and politics is that he\u2019s an expert at avoiding legal accountability and that scandals \u2013 any one of which would have ended a normal political career \u2013 seem to wash off his back.It\u2019s fair to ask, however, whether that is now changing because his potential legal liability goes beyond cases related to the 2020 election.Smith is also pursuing a possible case of infringing the Espionage Act and obstruction in an investigation over classified documents Trump hoarded at Mar-a-Lago. In a possible sign of his increasing vulnerability on this matter, two Trump Organization executives were due to appear before a federal grand jury investigating the case Thursday, afterSmith is asking questions about the handling of surveillance footage from the Florida resort. And in another extraordinary drama that reflects the staggering legal clouds hanging over Trump \u2013 but that might also end up demonstrating the extent of his political impunity among his voters \u2013 ais being asked to decide whether Trump raped former magazine columnist E. Jean Carroll in the mid 1990s and then defamed her. (Trump has denied all wrongdoing.)Both Biden and some of Trump\u2019s potential 2024 primary opponents, including Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, have made the case overtly or implicitly that this catalog of suspicion \u2013 not to mention the chaos it could cause during the campaign and potentially in a second Trump term \u2013 is more than enough to disqualify him from the presidency. And after his loss in 2020 and the defeat of many of his hand-picked candidates in last fall\u2019s midterms, there\u2019s reason to believe a national electorate could again reject the former president because of his conduct, character and his ongoing obsession with the last presidential election.It\u2019s a different story among the GOP base, which is still loyal to him. In anreleased last week, 68% of Republican primary voters agreed with the statement that investigations against him \u201care a politically motivated attempt to stop Trump. No other candidate is like him, we must support him.\u201dThe ex-president, who will appear inon Wednesday, has made some effective moves in seeking to wound DeSantis, his former prot\u00e9g\u00e9, who trails him in early polling. There\u2019s plenty of time for the race to change \u2013 and for DeSantis, who hasn\u2019t yet launched a bid, to overcome some rocky moments in recent weeks. But the ex-president\u2019s team looks to be running a more disciplined operation than his chaotic White House often did.Trump\u2019s demagogic and anti-democratic rhetoric at his campaign rallies, however, refutes any notion that he would be less threatening to American democracy in a second term.But that\u2019s a direct appeal to his followers. So for now, at least with GOP primary voters, what doesn\u2019t convict Trump, makes him stronger."

        "text": "About 2,100 Afghan refugees remain held in a sprawling compound in the United Arab Emirates more than 18 months after they were evacuated from Afghanistan largely by private groups working with the State Department.They are what\u2019s left of as many as 20,000 Afghans who were hastily relocated to the camp during theafter Kabulin August 2021. Several thousand were brought there by the State Department directly from Kabul and have since been relocated to the US or Canada.But thousands more, including those still stuck in the UAE, were evacuated weeks later, and sometimes from hundreds of miles away from Kabul, by private groups working to get as many out of Afghanistan as possible.Sources familiar with the matter told CNN that the private evacuation efforts, though well-intentioned, contributed at times to an already chaotic situation \u2013 though they also say that the frenzy of the withdrawal created unclear communication and expectations.Consequently, thousands of Afghans evacuated by private groups were left in a legal limbo with seemingly no clear path to the US \u2013 or anywhere else. And though the effort to resettle them has picked up in recent months, refugees inside the compound known as Emirates Humanitarian City, or EHC, are restless after almost two years of waiting inside a camp they are barred from leaving.Without a visa, they\u2019re not allowed inside the country.When they first arrived in the UAE in August 2021, Afghan evacuees were housed across dozens of buildings in the gated compound. Afghans were separated in rooms with their families across multi-level buildings divided by a common outdoor space.They were supposed to be there for a few days. But that\u2019s now approaching two years for the more than 2,000 people who remain there. The State Department says it continues to process refugees out of EHC \u201con an ongoing basis.\u201d One American Marine veteran closely involved said  that a family or two leave each week, bound mostly for the US and Canada, as well as Australia, with some scattered across Europe.At that pace it could still take more than a year to empty out the entire population of evacuees who remain at the compound.Their plight has gained recent attention from human rights groups, who say the refugees are being held arbitrarily by the UAE and have been subject to a host of abuses, including poor medical care and being held in \u201cprison-like\u201d conditions.Aput out by Human Rights Watch in March said Afghan asylum seekers have been \u201clocked up for over 15 months in cramped, miserable conditions with no hope of progress on their cases\u201d and are \u201cfacing further trauma now, after spending well over a year in limbo.\u201dIn a statement to CNN, a UAE official said the refugees at EHC have \u201creceived a comprehensive range of high-quality housing, sanitation, health, clinical, counseling, education, and food services to ensure their welfare.\u201dThe official said the UAE \u201ccontinues to do everything it can to bring this extraordinary exercise in humanitarian resettlement to a satisfactory conclusion. We understand that there are frustrations and this has taken longer than intended to complete.\u201d\u201cThe UAE remains committed to this ongoing cooperation with the US and other international partners to ensure that Afghan evacuees can live in safety, security, and dignity,\u201d the official added.Allegations similar to those raised by the HRW report were described in an appeal to the United Nations submitted last fall by an independent American attorney, who alleged \u201cwidespread human rights abuses,\u201d including inadequate health and mental health care, \u201cconstant\u201d surveillance and \u201crestricted access\u201d to government officials working their cases.In a statement to CNN, Mara Tekach, State Department coordinator for Afghan relocation efforts, said that while the department is aware of the Human Rights Watch report, the US government \u201cis not aware of any verified allegations of human rights violations at EHC.\u201dCNN has not independently verified those allegations.One refugee still stuck at EHC who spoke to CNN described extreme frustration over a seemingly hopeless situation. The man, who spoke on condition of anonymity out of safety concerns, said he worries about the effect the ordeal is having on his young daughter.\u201cMy daughter, from months ago until now, sometime when she starts talking, I can feel the pain in her voice,\u201d he said.The man showed CNN what appeared to be documentation that he was recommended for a Special Immigrant Visa by a US contractor with whom he worked in Afghanistan for almost two years. It was unclear whether that documentation is sufficient for what the State Department has required. He told CNN his daughter is growing anxious to leave.\u201cShe says, \u2018You have [taken] me somewhere that I cannot see anywhere, I cannot go outside,\u2019\u201d the man said. \u201cShe\u2019s asking me every time, frequently, \u2018When are we going to get out of here?\u2019\u201dDuring the chaotic weeks of the US withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021, thousands of American military veterans rushed to help evacuate as many Afghans as possible.Among them was US Marine veteran Pete Lucier, who worked with a coalition of veterans\u2019 groups known collectively as the #AfghanEvac coalition. Lucier said he is proud of much of the work that veteran and civilian volunteers did in helping Afghans flee the Taliban, which has since reinstated many of the draconian laws it had in place before the US and allied forces invaded after 9/11.Still, Lucier admitted there have been shortcomings, telling CNN that even well-intentioned veterans\u2019 groups and individuals ended up \u201csometimes, unfortunately, making things worse for vulnerable and at-risk people.\u201dMany of the individuals involved in evacuating Afghans had a \u201clack of familiarity with international law and the requirements of international travel,\u201d Lucier said. \u201cBroadly, I think EHC represents and embodies many of those challenges.\u201dDina Haynes, an international human rights lawyer and a professor at New England Law school in Bostonechoed those thoughts, saying that what has happened at EHC is \u201cnot a surprise at all to anybody who has paid attention\u201d to the US immigration system.\u201cThe only people that it was a surprise to were those new people that showed up thinking that they could fly people out and land them somewhere and get the US government to help,\u201d Haynes said.EHC is one of a few locations around the world where evacuated Afghans are still waiting to be processed for visas to the US or elsewhere. There are Afghans in Albania and Pakistan who were relocated there by private groups, as well as Afghans who were evacuated by the US government and are still being processed at Camp As-Sayliyah in Doha, Qatar, according to the State Department.Operated and funded by the UAE government, the EHC compound was first built in Abu Dhabi\u2019s industrial Mussafah area to receive quarantine evacuees stranded in China following the outbreak of Covid-19 in 2020. After the US withdrawal from Afghanistan, thousands were evacuated to the compound as part of a wider regional humanitarian call to assist.That was in part due to an agreement made in August 2021 between UAE officials and Joseph Robert III, a former US Marine and son of awith connections in the country.Robert\u2019s group, the Black Feather Foundation, joined the #AfghanEvac coalition made up of roughly 200 nonprofits in November 2021. Robert told CNN that relationships with UAE officials who were close with his late father helped secure the agreement to bring Afghans to UAE, sealed by a memorandum of understanding, which, according to Robert, stated that the UAE would receive and temporarily house Afghan refugees until they were able to move on to a third country.The EHC compound was not specifically part of the agreement, Robert told CNN, but was chosen by the UAE because of its capacity.CNN visited the compound in August 2021, during the first days when Afghans were arriving. Afghans awaiting security and medical screenings were kept in assigned rooms until they were called for processing.UAE officials and US embassy personnel were present at the main center at EHC, where dozens of Afghan men and women sat awaiting information on their next destination. It was not immediately clear who was processing information from the evacuees.Robert said he has seen no signs of the alleged abuse taking place at EHC, which, he said, he visits every few weeks. He blames the US for not swiftly processing people out of EHC despite originally taking advantage of the extra hands that brought them there.\u201cThe US government was using us at every turn when it benefited them,\u201d Robert said. \u201cAnd then when it came time to do the work on the back end, to process them out, they tried to leave us high and dry.\u201dBefore going to Afghanistan in August 2021, Robert said he first flew to the UAE, where he had several meetings with officials about lining up commitments to take in refugees, as well as provide planes. When he finally landed at the Kabul airport in Afghanistan on August 20, 2021, things began to change immediately.\u201cIt became just an on-the-fly, ad hoc assistance operation,\u201d Robert said, adding that, suddenly, \u201cour planes were being loaded with just people from the airport that the US would have evacuated.\u201dAfghan refugees arrived at EHC in three distinct groups. The first two groups were evacuated from the Hamid Karzai International Airport in Kabul in August 2021 by both the State Department and private groups working independently. The third group of Afghans were brought to EHC over the next two months by private groups, including Robert\u2019s Black Feather Foundation, from Mazar-i-Sharif, a city roughly 260 miles from Kabul.The EHC resident who spoke to CNN said he was flown out of Mazar-i-Sharif with his family after attempting to get through crowds of people at the Kabul airport during the evacuation in August 2021. Despite concerns about traveling from Kabul, especially with the possibility of running into the Taliban on the way, the resident said he thought it might his best chance \u201cto get myself and my family out of the danger zone.\u201dRobert told CNN the manifests for those flights were submitted by other organizations either directly to him or through other members of his team. Robert said he then submitted the manifests to the UAE government, which ran them through its own security systems.It is almost entirely this group of people \u2013 those evacuated after August 2021 \u2013 that remains stuck at EHC, both the State Department and Robert said. In her responses to CNN, Tekach said the State Department \u201chad limited information\u201d about refugees who came on those separate flights. She also emphasized that that the place where people were evacuated from \u201cis not a determining factor as to whether\u201d they qualify for relocation and resettlement.Toward the end of October 2021, Robert said it was clear to him that the State Department was \u201cnot going to continue processing\u201d any more people brought to the UAE since the evacuation had ended.\u201cThat\u2019s where things with State Department started to unravel,\u201d he said. \u201cThey processed only those that came on their aircraft, not even the ones that came on our aircraft alongside theirs during the [noncombatant evacuation]. As one State Department official told me, \u2018Not our plane, not our problem.\u2019\u201dTekach told CNN that the State Department paused processing in November 2021 \u201cin support of US public health priorities\u201d and began relocating individuals in March 2022.Still, Lucier told CNN that the US government and State Department likely were not clear enough in their communication about what private organizations could or could not do, leading to much of the confusion and at-times chaotic interference that occurred.Robert expressed frustration over security concerns the State Department has raised about the Afghans at EHC, saying that for the most part the evacuees are \u201cable to provide everything they needed\u201d in terms of paperwork and documents, including reference letters from US employers while in Afghanistan.While he acknowledged that there were shortcomings and mistakes made in the broader evacuation effort by private groups, Robert also said that was in part due to a \u201cUS government plan that was nonexistent.\u201dAll in all, Robert said volunteers were still able to evacuate \u201ctens of thousands of individuals, despite the US government\u2019s inability to appropriately evacuate them in the first place.\u201dAsked how many State Department officials have access to EHC and how frequently they are at the compound working to process people out, the State Deaprtment\u2019s Tekach said US officials have access to the compound \u201cfor a number of purposes, including gathering information to work on case processing and to support the well-being of the Afghan population at the facility.\u201dRobert said that over the past six months, an average of three to five State Department personnel have come to EHC twice a week. After early frictions, Robert said his relationship with US government personnel who deal with EHC is \u201cin a much better place now.\u201dDespite the delays, Robert said they\u2019re slowly making progress in resettling the Afghans still at EHC.\u201cHaving 20,000 people pass through the walls of EHC, and we\u2019re down to the last 2,000 \u2013 that\u2019s a rather remarkable effort, although things didn\u2019t go as smoothly as we\u2019d planned or hoped,\u201d he said.\u201cEven though everyone wants it to be faster, things are moving at a rather steady and consistent pace, and everyone\u2019s still actively doing everything they can to find suitable pathways for people and accommodate families, and find other opportunities if a previous one falls through. Everyone is working tremendously hard to do what is right by these people,\u201d Robert said.As the US and others work to process Afghans out, Human Rights Watch is still trying to bring attention to their plight.\u201cThey\u2019re still in this facility, which was never designed to hold people for this long,\u201d said Joey Shea, the lead researcher on HRW\u2019s recent report. \u201cAnd they\u2019ve been effectively imprisoned after an extremely traumatic experience of fleeing a Taliban takeover.\u201dShea said the clearest solution is through the US government.\u201cThere just needs to be more resources put by the US government to make sure that these asylum and humanitarian parole and other applications are processed quickly,\u201d she said.At EHC, the current resident who spoke to CNN described how happy he was to have been evacuated from Afghanistan in 2021.  Aside from marrying \u201cthe love of my life\u201d and having children, he said that leaving Afghanistan was \u201cthe best day of my life.\u201d\u201cWhen the plane took off, I couldn\u2019t fit in my own skin because of the happiness that I had,\u201d he said emotionally. \u201cThis is a new life that I began to live with my family. I was happy and proud I could do something for my wife, my kids.\u201dThe recommendation letter he received from his US employer says he is \u201ccompletely trustworthy, intelligent, and a faithful employee\u201d and the \u201ckind of person who will make a valuable contribution and service to the US, if allowed to immigrate.\u201dBut the longer he and his family languish at EHC, he said, the harder it is to explain his work with the US.\u201c\u2018What will happen to us? Why are we abandoned by the US?\u2019\u201d he said his wife asks him. \u201cMy wife tells me that maybe it was not right that you worked for the US government.\u201dCNN\u2019s Mostafa Salem contributed to this report."

        "text": "Attorneys for anwho allege there is political interference at the Justice Department in themet with congressional investigators Friday to lay the groundwork for what their client hopes to share with Congress, according to sources familiar with the matter.The attorneys privately offered investigators from the Democratic-led Senate Finance Committee and Republican-led House Ways and Means Committee a glimpse into the information their client could share with Congress, the sources said. Such a disclosure is a typical early step in whistleblower cases involving sensitive tax information.A Republican aide with the Ways and Means Committee said they anticipate an in-person interview with the whistleblower in the near future.The whistleblower alleges that Delaware US Attorney David Weiss\u2019 ability to bring charges in the case is being thwarted by political appointees. That would contradict promises by Attorney General Merrick Garlandthat Weiss, a Donald Trump appointee, has full authority to make final decisions on whether to prosecute President Joe Biden\u2019s son.\u201cThe process is proceeding on a bipartisan basis with ranking member [Mike] Crapo\u2019s staff,\u201d said Ryan Carey, a spokesman for Senate Finance Chair Ron Wyden, an Oregon Democrat.Last month, Mark Lytle, an attorney for the whistleblower, wrote to a handful of House and Senate committee leaders expressing his client\u2019s interest in making \u201cprotected whistleblower disclosures to Congress.\u201dLytle said his client, an unnamed IRS criminal supervisory special agent, \u201chas been overseeing the ongoing and sensitive investigation of a high-profile, controversial subject,\u201d which a source has confirmed was Hunter Biden.A famous last name, business deals and a looming probe: Republicans ramp up investigation of Biden familyFederal prosecutors have spent years, spanning three attorneys general, investigating Hunter Biden and have weighed bringing charges against him for alleged tax crimes and a false statement, CNN has previously reported. So far, no charges have been filed. Hunter Biden has denied wrongdoing.The president affirmed his support for his son in an interview that aired Friday on MSNBC, adding that the Justice Department\u2019s investigation would not affect his presidency.\u201cFirst of all, my son has done nothing wrong. I trust him. I have faith in him,\u201d Joe Biden told Stephanie Ruhle. \u201cIt impacts my presidency by making me feel proud of him.\u201dIn an April statement, the White House said the president was committed to an investigation \u201cfree from any political interference.\u201d\u201cPresident Biden has made clear that this matter would be handled independently by the Justice Department, under the leadership of a U.S. Attorney appointed by President Trump, free from any political interference by the White House. He has upheld that commitment,\u201d White House spokesman Ian Sams said.The IRS whistleblower claimed to have information that \u201ccontradicts sworn testimony to Congress by a senior political appointee,\u201d according to the letter from his attorney. That senior political appointee was Garland, people familiar with the matter previously told CNN.Appearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee in March, Garland said: \u201cI have pledged not to interfere with that investigation, and I have carried through on my pledge.\u201dAt the March hearing, Iowa Sen. Chuck Grassley asked Garland whether Weiss has had to seek the cooperation of US attorneys in the District of Columbia or California to bring the Hunter Biden case. The question was based on information Grassley\u2019s investigators have received on possible obstacles Weiss may face to bring the tax charges, a person briefed on the matter said. That\u2019s because Hunter Biden lives in southern California and the tax documents at issue were prepared in Washington, DC, making those the two jurisdictions where a prosecution could be brought.Garland responded to the question by saying he hasn\u2019t heard of Weiss having any obstacles in bringing a case.\u201cThe US attorney in Delaware has been advised that he has full authority to make those kinds of referrals that you\u2019re talking about or to bring cases in other jurisdictions if he feels that it\u2019s necessary, and I will assure that if he does that he will be able to do that,\u201d Garland said. \u201cIf he needs to bring a case in another jurisdiction, he will have my full authority to do that.\u201dJustice Department regulations provide for Weiss to get permission from the attorney general to seek to bring a case in a jurisdiction outside of Delaware. A person briefed on the matter said Garland has ensured Weiss has the authority to do so.Spokespersons for the Justice Department and the US attorneys in Delaware, California\u2019s Central District, and Washington, DC, declined to comment."

        "text": "In 1953, millions crowded around their neighbours' television sets to watch the Queen's coronation. Seventy years on, the crowning of King Charles III was a very different kind of spectacle.Before dawn, at 04:30 BST, a convoy of three coaches set off from Barnsley, South Yorkshire, carrying royal enthusiasts to London. On board was Sandra Hanna, who was born 10 days after King Charles. Although she and the King had experienced somewhat different upbringings, they had a \"shared history\", she said.Explaining why she had risen up so early to make the 175-mile (282km) journey, she remarked: \"You can't soak up the atmosphere through a TV screen.\"Coming so soon after the funeral of Queen Elizabeth II in September 2022 - a moment of high emotion for millions who said goodbye - this coronation was always going to have a very different ambience. The wet May weather threatened to dampen the mood.But still the crowds came - to central London and also to cities and towns across the UK. People gathered in public spaces where the ceremony was screened live.Draped in Ukrainian and union flags, David-Jon Davies, 52, watched on a big screen at Liverpool's Eurovision Village. It was a proud moment for the city, he said: \"Although I might see another coronation in my lifetime, I definitely won't see one at the same time we're hosting Eurovision.\"While some of those who turned out around the UK were ardent monarchists, for others it was the sense of occasion that mattered. \"I wouldn't say I'm a royalist but I wouldn't want to have missed this,\" said Karen Greenfield, 54, from Doncaster, who watched in Hull city centre.Many more settled indoors to watch.One of those was Audrey Biggs, from St Hilary, in the Vale of Glamorgan, who celebrated her 100th birthday in a care home. Charles would be the fifth monarch whose reign she would live through. Back in 1953, her family had been one of those who bought a TV to watch the previous coronation.\"He's a rather sensitive sort of a man,\" she said of the King. \"He'll be anxious to make a good job of it, which he will I'm sure.\"In a digital, multi-channel, multi-device era, the 2023 Coronation was never going to be the same kind of occasion as 1953. Some protested against the occasion itself. Others tried their best to ignore the whole thing.The street parties and gun salutes were still there, of course. And members of the public found idiosyncratic ways to celebrate the occasion ahead.In Milton Keynes, a model railway club spent months building a miniature version of the coronation. \"Yarn-bombers\" around Scotland crafted knitted effigies of King Charles and Queen Camilla and attached them to post boxes. Chocolatier Jennifer Lindsey-Clarke, from Worthing, in West Sussex, sculpted a life-sized bust of the King from more than 17 litres (3.7 gallons) of melted chocolate.At the same time, plenty of others switched off - either because they simply weren't interested in the spectacle, or because they considered it an affront to democracy.\"We won't be taking any notice of it,\" Owen Williams, from Barry, told BBC Radio Wales. \"Instead of a coronation, I'd prefer an election. Instead of Charles, I'd prefer a choice.\"Other non-monarchists concluded their best option was to throw celebrations of their own. The Dog and Partridge pub, in Sheffield, declared itself an \"anti-Coronation safe space\". The Cube cinema, in Bristol, organised an \"anti-street party\" for critics of the British empire.Pro-republic rallies were held in Cardiff and Edinburgh. A crowd of anti-monarchy protesters gathered in London's Trafalgar Square, where the ceremony was relayed over loudspeakers. Whenever Charles's name was mentioned, demonstrators chanted \"not my King\". There were also regular bursts of \"free Graham Smith\" - the head of campaign group Republic, who was arrested earlier in the day.Before the procession started, there was a sense of anticipation in crowds around Buckingham Palace. In her bright red, blue and white wig, Heidi Roberts, from Surrey, said she was looking forward to having something to celebrate: \"I think we're all mourning the Queen, and I think it's a bit of a hangover from that.\"As the procession began just after 10:20 BST, onlookers along the route erupted in cheers. This was the pageantry they had come for; that and a glimpse of the King and Queen.The carriage reached Westminster Abbey and the ceremony began - broadcast to the world and piped to the crowds outside.This time the TV pictures were in colour. And social media would curate it for you. On Twitter, Penny Mordaunt - the Conservative MP and leader of the House of Commons, who brandished the Sword of State as part of its presentation to the King - began trending. So too for a time was the republican slogan #NotMyKing.In Majorca, British expats and tourists watched on big screens as they sat in the sunshine in novelty crowns. In New York, Iain Anderson, 43, organised a screening at Tea and Sympathy, a British-themed caf\u00e9 and shop.\"We haven't had the best history after that little war\", he joked, referring to the American Revolution. \"But people still like the history. The theatre of it, the pomp and the circumstance.\"At the moment the Archbishop of Canterbury placed the crown on King Charles's head, the sound of popping corks could be heard along The Mall. Soon afterwards, as the carriage returned to Buckingham Palace, there were shouts of \"God Save the King\" and \"hip hip hooray\" from the crowd.The appearance of the King and Queen on the palace's balcony - albeit with a scaled-back military flypast due to the weather - was imminent. The barriers were lowered. The crowd rushed to the front.Cheryl Kingbrooks, Joanne Gerrard and her son Ryan were among them. \"We never thought we'd get right to the front,\" Cheryl said afterwards.\"We were right at the back of The Mall, and then as soon as the gates opened, we just ran down and we didn't realise we'd get that far forward. But we did and it was absolutely amazing,\" Ryan added.Soon after, the new King and Queen retreated inside. For some it had been a day to immerse themselves in, to be part of, come rain or shine. For others it was something to ignore or even endure. Either way, a new reign had begun."

        "text": "It is the mid Wales landmark that started out as a joke and lasted for 20 years.Now, it is making a comeback.Up until last November,on the A44 in Powys between Rhayader and Kington.But drivers who followed the directions to Terminal 1 or 3 ended up not at an airport, not even an airfield, but just a field on the outskirts of the village.The sign was taken down last year when the man who spent \u00a325,000 keeping it in place decided he would try to make it an official landmark.Nicholas Whitehead launched a crowdfunding campaign with the slogan \"give us a sign\".Six months later, a brand-new one has appeared.The airport's \"founder\" said he was delighted.\"When the sign came down we gained thousands of followers on Facebook. There was so much support for getting another, I felt sure the crowd-funder would work,\" he said.\"In a time of austerity, no local authority would want to pay for this, so we tried to raise all the money ourselves. We only needed \u00a31,300 and we raised \u00a32,000.\"The extra money will be donated to the Wales Air Ambulance, which Mr Whitehead said he was happy to support given the aviation connection.Mr Whitehead was a journalist and editor for the Brecon and Radnor express, a writer on Radio 4's comedy sketch show Week Ending and once worked with Monty Python's Terry Jones.With a strong sense of the absurd, he created the fictional airport in 2002.\"It started off as a wild conversation with friends one evening. We thought of renting a sign for something that wasn't really there, possibly a project that didn't exist, and we settled on the airport.\"He soon realised the plan was possible.\"I approached Wrexham Signs, who own the billboard, and expected them to say, 'you can't do that'. But apparently, you can,\" he said.\"As a journalist, you find that whatever you do, someone, somewhere, is going to get upset about it. But Llandegley International is the exception. People love it.\"In the sign's original location near Crossgates, it cost about \u00a31,500 per year to maintain. But thanks to the crowd-funding, a new one has been installed to the east of the village.The Richards family offered to put the sign outside their farm near Llandegley, where it can stay permanently.Holly Richards jumped at the chance to help out: \"We were sad to see it go, so at the first chance of having it back we were happy to put it on our land.\"Since the sign has come back the social media response has been great. It's become a real talking point once more.\"Fencing contractor Fred Morris put up the new sign and described it as a bit of a folly: \"When you tell people where you come from, they ask 'have you seen the sign for the airport?' People play along with the joke.\"Mark Lythgoe co-owns a nearby roadside snack van and said it had been great for business.\"We've had a lot of people asking where the airport is,\" Mr Lythgoe said. \"We're thinking of renaming the van the international departure lounge. It's all a bit of fun.\"The airport has taken off on Facebook. Thousands of followers enjoy updates about Llandegley's impressive environmental credentials, and engage in flights of fancy about the \"top secret\" Terminal 2.Mr Whitehead now keeps the old sign in his garden in Wembury, Devon.He said the airport had helped him to see a more positive side to social media.\"There's been an outpouring of love. People have said the Llandegley International Facebook page is one of the best things on the internet, because there's no unpleasantness,\" he said.When asked if he thought the airport was real, he said: \"It exists in the same way songs exist. If you set fire to the scrap of paper on which Paul McCartney wrote Yesterday, that wouldn't destroy the song.\"The song exists as a shared experience; it's indestructible. It's the same with the airport.\"With a permanent sign in place and a big online fanbase, Mr Whitehead said he hoped to gain official recognition for the quirky institution he founded.\"It's not exactly a national monument - but it is a national treasure. It has become an item of Welsh heritage.\"For now, he is happy Llandegley International is on the road again.Man ends 20-year fake airport joke that cost \u00a325k'Wales is in England' gaffe sparks TikToker's trip'Free booze' offered in translation error"

        "text": "The number of pharmacies in England has fallen by 160 over the last two years, BBC analysis shows.There are now 11,026 community chemists, according to data from NHS Business Services Authority - the lowest number since 2015.Rising operational costs, staff shortages and reduced government financial support have been blamed.This is despite rising patient demand, and plans for pharmacists to provide more services to ease pressure on GPs.Pharmacists are warning that many more local businesses could close, without help.Online services are available, but many rely on a local chemist for advice and to pick up prescriptions.On Tuesday, the government will publish a primary care access plan designed to improve and extend availability of consultations by GPs. Ministers have also announced \u00a3240m ($303m) for practices to replace old phones with more modern call systems and online tools to make it easier for patients to get in contact.Part of the primary care plan is expected to include an expanded role for pharmacists, but there are concerns about their feasibility.Many pharmacists feel they have been taken for granted and expected to offer more services, even though their real-terms funding has fallen. They estimate there has been a 30% cut in government funding over the last seven years, after taking account of inflation.Dr Leyla Hannbeck, chief executive of the Association of Independent Multiple Pharmacies, said there was a shortfall of \u00a31.1bn in funding for independent pharmacies every year.\"This has led to many pharmacies severely struggling with cashflow problems,\" she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme, adding that because most of their work is NHS-funded, the pharmacies cannot pass on rising costs to customers.\"On top of that, we've got the workforce challenges that we have been struggling with for so many years,\" she said, warning \"many more\" pharmacies could close this year unless increased support was given.\"We are urgently needing the government to step in and provide that funding,\" she said.Sanjeev Panesar owns Pan Pharmacy in Birmingham. The business was set up by his parents, and has just celebrated its 40th anniversary, but he fears services might have to be cut back, and staff numbers may also have to be reviewed.\"Things are in serious jeopardy. It's our worst year ever, where we've made a loss. We have to make some really tough calls and decisions now,\" he said.Mr Panesar says he would love to support the government by helping the NHS and GP services, but said it is not possible with current financial constraints.The workload has grown steadily, with more patients, some frustrated over lack of GP access, coming in for consultations and advice. That comes on top of the core function of dispensing medicines and treatments, while there is increasing demand for home delivery of medication.Janet Morrison, chief executive of the Pharmaceutical Services Negotiating Committee, hopes the new plan will address long-standing problems in the sector.\"What everyone learnt during the pandemic was one of the two places that will stay open was the pharmacy - lots more people come in for advice and support that we're not paid to provide. What we've been saying to ministers is we're part of the solution because we can provide access.\"Pharmacists in England look to Scotland,includes a contract between the sector and the Scottish government setting out what services are expected, with payment for every consultation.These cover minor ailments and illnesses, some of which might once have been dealt with at GP practices. In England there is a less formal arrangement, with some consultations by pharmacists not remunerated.  There is also more prescribing of medicines by pharmacists in Scotland.George Romanes, who owns a chain of local pharmacies in the Scottish borders, believes the new structure works better than the arrangements south of the border.\"I used to have an English pharmacy but I sold it, and all the outlets we have now are in Scotland. I think the Scottish contract is much more patient-focused,\" he said.\"The fact you can come in and see a pharmacist there and then as it were, rather than needing an appointment, is very beneficial for patients, they like to get a problem sorted as quick as they can.\"A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said an extra \u00a3100m was invested in the sector last September.\"We are supporting pharmacies to provide a range of clinical services and we are increasing the services pharmacists - who are degree-qualified medical health professionals - can provide to their community, including managing oral contraception,\" they said.Mr Panesar called for political leaders, including Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, whose mother ran a pharmacy, to visit local pharmacies to see first-hand the pressures they face.\"I'd love him to come and see what we do, how patients feel about what we offer and actually, that this is serious, and that the sector is crumbling, and is going to fall down like a stack of dominoes, if there's not intervention urgently.\""

        "text": "This video can not be playedGraham Smith was arrested on Coronation dayAn anti-monarchy protester detained during the Coronation says he believes the police had \"every intention\" of arresting him before the event.The chief executive of Republic, Graham Smith, was one of 64 people arrested by the Metropolitan Police in London.He said he was held despite being in close conversation with the Met \"for four months\" about the group's plans.The Met said it had \"a duty to intervene when protest becomes criminal and may cause serious disruption\".Commander Karen Findlay, who led the Met's policing operation during the Coronation, said on Saturday: \"Earlier this week we said our tolerance for any disruption, whether through protest or otherwise, will be low and that we would deal robustly with anyone intent on undermining the celebration.\"Prime Minister Rishi Sunak gave his backing to the police, saying they act independently of the government and did what they thought was best.\"I'm grateful to the police and everyone who played a part in ensuring that this weekend has gone so well, so successfully and so safely,\" he told reporters in Hertfordshire. \"That was an extraordinary effort by so many people and I'm grateful to them for all their hard work.\"Mr Smith told BBC Radio 4's Today programme he had been detained for 16 hours after being stopped by officers who suspected him and group members of carrying \"lock on\" devices to tie themselves to inanimate objects -by the government last week.\"They also said they had intelligence, which is untrue,\" Mr Smith went on. \"If they did have intelligence their intelligence officers are either lying or incompetent because there was never any discussion, thought, email, message, anything that suggested any intent to do anything disruptive.\"Mr Smith added that after months of discussions with the Met, the force had \"repeatedly said, right up until Friday, that they had no concerns about our protest plans, that they were well aware of what we were going to do and they would engage with us and not disrupt us\".\"So they've repeatedly lied about their intentions, and I believe they had every intention of arresting us prior to doing so.\"Mr Smith also rejected suggestions his arrest along with other protesters was necessary to limit disruption to the Coronation, calling it \"disgraceful\".He told the programme: \"That's not an excuse to rob people of their rights. It's not an excuse to arrest people and detain them for 16 hours because some people want to enjoy a party.\"They stopped us because the law was introduced, rushed in last week, to give them the powers to stop us on any flimsy pretext.\"That law means we no longer in this country have the right to protest, we only have the freedom to protest contingent on the permission of senior police officers and politicians, and it's my view that those senior police officers were under immense pressure from politicians.\"But Met Police Federation chairman Ken Marsh said officers \"police without fear or favour,\" insisting the force had done \"an incredible job\" policing the Coronation.He told the Today programme: \"We have to take into consideration everything that at that moment is put in front of us. If individuals intend to cause an incident which will affect others near them or around them... then we take action to deal with it.\"Protesting can take place in this country, but it's to the level of which you perform that protesting that we have to balance and deal with.\"Concerns were also raised over reports three volunteers with a Westminster-based women's safety programme had been.Caroline Russell, Green Party London Assembly member and chair of the Police, Crime Committee at the London Assembly, said it was \"really worrying\" that the arrests had happened.Speaking in a personal capacity, she told Today: \"These people were literally wearing hi-vis vests with the Met Police logo on. They were volunteers for a Westminster programme in collaboration with the Met police.\"Those people volunteering were handing flip-flops to those in high heels, and handing out rape alarms so people could get home safely. It's extraordinary that they got caught up in the Met's safety net.\"The Met says it made 64 arrests on the day of the Coronation of King Charles III and Queen Camilla, including for offences such as breach of the peace and conspiracy to cause a public nuisance. Forty-six people have been bailed.Four people have been charged so far, including one person charged with the suspicion of causing a religiously aggravated offence; two for the possession of Class A drugs; and another for breaching Section 5 of the Public Order Act, which relates to displaying any material that is threatening or abusive.All four will appear in Westminster Magistrates' Court later this month.On Monday, members of the public will take part inacross the UK to mark the final day of the Coronation celebrations.Met Police arrest anti-monarchy protestersTough calls made on Coronation arrests - ministerAnti-monarchy protester tells of Coronation arrest.

        "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-65243132",
        "text": "It's being described as the most detailed ever map of the influence of dark matter through cosmic history.A telescope in Chile has traced the distribution of this mysterious stuff on a quarter of the sky and across almost 14 billion years of time.The result is once again a spectacular confirmation of Einstein's ideas.Although dark matter makes up about 85% of all mass in the Universe, it's extremely difficult to detect and defies a ready description.But dark matter influences the large scale structure of everything we see - where all the galaxies are, where the voids in space are. It's the scaffolding on which the visible structure of the Universe is hung.It neither emits nor absorbs light. The only way you can very obviously infer its presence is through its interplay with gravity.Big rotating galaxies of stars would fly apart were it not for the inclusion of some unseen mass pulling on them and keeping them intact.But dark matter will bend, or lens, background light, and this is how its whereabouts was mapped by the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT).The Chile facility observed the Cosmic Microwave Background, or CMB - a pervasive but faint glow of long-wavelength radiation that comes to us from the very edge of the observable Universe.ACT mapped the subtle distortions in this ancient light that were introduced as it passed by all intervening matter.You can liken it to the way light is bent as it passes through the bulges and bumps in an old glass window pane.If you know what you're looking at outside, you can use the distortions to say something about the glass.In the same way, the CMB can be decoded to reveal all intervening structure on its journey to us.There have been \"gravitational lensing\" detections similar to this in the past, most notably by the European Space Agency's Planck observatory a decade ago. But ACT surpasses all in terms of resolution and sensitivity.Successive experiments indicate the cosmic contents include:The Universe is calculated to be 13.8 billion years oldIn the image at the top of this page, the coloured areas are the portions of the sky studied by the telescope.Orange regions show where there is more mass, or matter, along the line of sight; purple where there is less. Typical features are hundreds of millions of light-years across.The grey/white areas show where contaminating light from dust in our Milky Way galaxy has obscured a deeper view.The distribution of matter agrees very well with scientific predictions.ACT observations indicate that the \"lumpiness\" of the Universe and the rate at which it has been expanding after 14 billion years of evolution are just what you'd expect from the standard model of cosmology, which has Einstein's theory of gravity (general relativity) at its foundation.Recent measurements that used an alternative background light, one emitted from stars in galaxies rather than the CMB, had suggested the Universe lacked sufficient lumpiness.\"It's one of the 'cosmic tensions' we all talk about,\" said Prof Jo Dunkley from Princeton University, US. \"But with this new result, we find exactly the right amount of lumpiness - no tension! So, if there is a tension, it is something that appears in the galaxy data - not in ours,\" she told BBC News.Another tension concerns the rate at which the Universe is expanding - a number called the Hubble constant.When Planck looked at temperature fluctuations across the CMB, it determined the rate to be about 67 kilometres per second per megaparsec (A megaparsec is 3.26 million light-years).Or put another way - the expansion increases by 67km per second for every 3.26 million light-years we look further out into space.A tension arises because measurements of the expansion in the nearby Universe, made using, clocks in at about 73km/s per megaparsec.It's a difference that can't easily be explained.ACT, employing its lensing technique to nail down the expansion rate, outputs a number similar to Planck's. \"It's very close - about  68km/s per megaparsec,\" said Dr Mathew Madhavacheril from the the University of Pennsylvania.ACT team-member Prof Blake Sherwin from Cambridge University, UK, added: \"We and Planck and several other probes are coming in on the lower side. Obviously, you could have a scenario where both the measurements are right and there's some new physics that explains the discrepancy. But we're using independent techniques, and I think we're now starting to close the loophole where we could all be riding this new physics and one of the measurements has to be wrong.\"Papers describing the new results have been submitted to The Astrophysical Journal and posted on the.The telescope, which worked from 2007 to 2022 before being dismantled, was funded by the US National Science Foundation. The scientific collaboration has yet to finish analysing all its data."

        "name": "SpaceX Starship: Elon Musk promises second launch within months",
        "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-65334810",
        "text": "This video can not be playedSpaceX launch: How it really went... in 59 secondsElon Musk's SpaceX company's mammoth new rocket, Starship, has exploded on its maiden flight.No-one was hurt in the uncrewed test that lifted off from Texas' coast on Thursday morning local time.After two to three minutes into the flight, the rocket - the biggest ever developed - started to tumble out of control and was soon destroyed by onboard charges.Mr Musk has said his company will try again in a couple of months.SpaceX engineers still class Thursday's mission as a success. They like to \"test early and often\" and are not afraid to break things. They will have gathered a mass of data to work towards the next flight. A second Starship is almost ready to take flight.\"Congrats @SpaceX team on an exciting test launch of Starship! Learned a lot for next test launch in a few months,\" Mr Musk tweeted.The Federal Aviation Administration, which licenses rocket launches in the US, said it would oversee a mishap investigation. A spokesman said this was standard practice when a vehicle was lost in flight.The entrepreneur had tried to temper expectations before the launch. Just getting the vehicle off the ground and not destroying the launch pad infrastructure would be considered \"a win\", he said.His wish was granted. Starship cleared its launch complex on the US-Mexico border and picked up pace as it headed out over the Gulf of Mexico. But it was evident within a minute or so that not everything was going to plan.As the rocket climbed higher and higher, it could be seen that six of the 33 engines at the base of the vehicle had been shut down or had flamed out.And three minutes into the flight, it was pretty obvious the end was near. When the two halves of the vehicle should have been separating, they were in fact still connected - and veering off course.At launch-plus-four-minutes, as Starship was losing altitude, a large explosion ripped across the blue sky, the result of computers triggering the vehicle's Flight Termination System (FTS).\"With a test like this, success comes from what we learn, and we learned a tremendous amount about the vehicle and ground systems today that will help us improve on future flights of Starship,\" SpaceX said in a statement.The top segment of Starship, also known as the ship, had taken flight previously on short hops, but this was the first time it had launched with its lower-stage.This immense booster, called simply Super Heavy, was fired while clamped to its launch mount in February. However, its cluster of engines on that occasion were throttled back to half their capability.If, as promised, SpaceX went for 90% thrust on Thursday, the stage should have delivered something close to 70 meganewtons.That's double the thrust put out by the Saturn V rocket that famously sent men to the Moon in the 1960s and 70s.Starship may not have destroyed its launch pad but later pictures indicated the forceful departure had done a fair amount of damage to concrete surfaces.The plan for the mission had been to send the ship on one near-complete revolution of the Earth, ending with a splashdown in the Pacific, a couple of hundred km north of Hawaii.There was no expectation that the ship or Super Heavy would be recovered. However, long term, this is the plan. The idea is to land both halves, refuel them and launch again - over and over.If this can be achieved, it will be transformative.Starship has a prospective payload performance to orbit of more than 100 tonnes per flight. When this is allied to the low cost of operation - principally, just the cost of fuel - it should open the door to an exciting future.\"In the industry, there's certainly a very high expectation at the potential of this vehicle for disruption,\" said space consultant Carissa Bryce Christensen.\"Its massive capacity, from a commercial standpoint, could be significant. A very large vehicle that's human-rated could be important for the emergence of space tourism. The other element is the vehicle being inexpensive. So, you've got a vehicle with two transformational aspects - massive capacity and, potentially, at a very low price,\" the CEO of BryceTech told BBC News.The entrepreneur will initially use Starship to launch thousands more satellites for his broadband internet constellation in the sky - Starlink.Only when engineers are confident in the vehicle's reliability will they permit people to fly on the rocket.The first mission has already been lined up. It will be commanded by billionaire US businessman and fast-jet pilot Jared Isaacman. He's already flown to space in a SpaceX Dragon capsule.The first flight around the Moon will be conducted by Japanese retail fashion billionaire Yusaku Maezawa. He will take eight artists with him as part of his DearMoon project.The US space agency, Nasa, wants to use a version of Starship to land its astronauts on the Moon's surface."

        "name": "UN climate report: Scientists release 'survival guide' to avert climate disaster",
        "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-65000182",
        "text": "UN chief Antonio Guterres says a major new report on climate change is a \"survival guide for humanity\".Clean energy and technology can be exploited to avoid the growing climate disaster, the report says.But at a meeting in Switzerland to agree their findings, climate scientists warned a key global temperature goal will likely be missed.Their report lays out how rapid cuts to fossil fuels can avert the worst effects of climate change.In response to the findings, UN secretary general Antonio Guterres says that all countries should bring forward their net zero plans by a decade. These targets are supposed to rapidly cut the greenhouse gas emissions that warm our planet's atmosphere.\"There is a rapidly closing window of opportunity to secure a liveable and sustainable future for all,\" the report states.Governments had previously agreed to act to avoid global temperature rise going above 1.5C. But the world has already warmed by 1.1C and now experts say that it is likely to breach 1.5C in the 2030s.The UK government responded that the report makes it clear that countries must \"work towards far more ambitious climate commitments\" ahead of the UN climate summit COP28 in November.\"The UK is a world leader in working towards net zero, but we need to go further and faster,\" a spokesperson said.Small islands in the Pacific are some of the countries expected to be worst hit by climate change.Responding to the report, the chair of the Alliance of Small Island States Fatumanava-o-Upolu III Dr. Pa'olelei Luteru said: \"While our people are being displaced from their homes and climate commitments go unmet, the fossil fuel industry is enjoying billions in profits. There can be no excuses for this continued lack of action.\"The- the scientific body that advises the UN on rising temperatures - is agreed on by all governments involved.Their new study aims to boil down to one slim volume several landmark findings on the causes, impacts and solutions to climate change that have been released since 2018.It outlines the significant impacts that climate change is having on the world already, and explains that these will get much worse.By 2100 extreme coastal flooding that used to happen once-a-century is expected to occur at least annually in half of the world's tidal gauge locations - places where sea level recordings are made.Concentrations of the warming gas CO2 in the atmosphere are at their highest in 2 million years. The world is now warmer than at any time in the past 125,000 years - and will likely get warmer still over the next decade.\"Even in the near term, global warming is more likely than not to reach 1.5C even under the very low greenhouse gas scenario,\" the report states.\"If we aim for 1.5C and achieve 1.6C, that is still much much better than saying, it's too late, and we are doomed and I'm not even trying,\" Dr Friederike Otto, from Imperial College, a member of the core writing team for this report, told BBC News.\"And I think what this report shows very, very clearly is there is so much to win by trying.\"The synthesis shows that projected emissions of CO2 from existing fossil fuel infrastructure, such as oil wells and gas pipelines, would bust the remaining carbon budget - the amount of CO2 that can still be emitted - for staying under this key temperature threshold.And while not explicitly mentioning new projects like Willow oil in the US or the Cumbria coal mine in the UK, the scientists involved have few doubts about their impact.\"There's not a cut-off day (for fossil fuels), but it's clear that the fossil fuel infrastructure we already have will blow through that carbon budget,\" Dr Oliver Geden, from the German Institute for International and Security Affairs and a member of the report's core writing team, told BBC News.\"The remaining carbon budget in opening new fossil fuel infrastructure is certainly not compatible with the 1.5C target.\"The document argues strongly that going past 1.5C will not be the end of the world as this may only be a \"temporary overshoot\".The authors say that they are optimistic that dramatic changes can be achieved rapidly, pointing to the massive falls in the price of energy made from solar and wind.They also argue that changes driven by consumers in terms of diet, food waste and switching to low carbon transport can achieve significant cuts in emissions from many sectors.But the report also acknowledges that in addition to getting to net zero emissions as soon as possible, large scale use of carbon dioxide removal technology will be needed.Some observers have their doubts. \"We know what needs to happen, but the carbon removal part and carbon capture and storage ideas are a massive distraction,\" said Lili Fuhr, from the Centre for International Environmental Law, who attended the approval session.Responding to the report's call for more urgent action, the UN secretary general is calling for countries to bring forward their plans for net zero by a decade.\"Leaders of developed countries must commit to reaching net zero as close as possible to 2040, the limit they should all aim to respect,\" he said in a statement. He also calls on the likes of India and China who have announced net zero plans for beyond 2050 to try and bring them forward by a decade as well."

        "name": "Heatwave: Is India ready to deal with extreme temperatures?",
        "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-65299807",
        "text": "In his best-selling 2020 novel, The Ministry for the Future, science fiction writer Kim Stanley Robinson opens with a deadly heatwave in India which kills millions of people.The sky blazes like an \"atomic bomb\", the heat from it is a \"slap in the face\", the eyes sting and \"everything was tan and beige and a brilliant, unbearable white\". Water doesn't help because it is \"hot as a bath\u2026 worse than the air\". People die \"faster than ever\".Mr Robinson's dystopian tale about global heating might be a horror fantasy of sorts, but it is also a chilling warning. Earlier this week,and many others were admitted to hospital after attending a government-sponsored event in an open ground under a blazing sun in Navi Mumbai in India's Maharashtra state.India is one of the countries most exposed and vulnerable to heat. Hot days and hot night events have risen significantly, and are projected to increase between two and four-fold by 2050. Heatwaves are also predicted to arrive earlier, stay longer and become more frequent.The weather office has predicted above-average temperatures and heatwaves until the end of May. Average temperatures in Indiabetween 1901 and 2018, partly due to climate change.Heatwaves killed more than 22,000 people between 1992 and 2015, according to official figures. Experts reckon the actual toll would be much higher. Yet, the country really \"hasn't understood the importance of heat and how heat can kill\", says Dileep Mavalankar, director of the Gujarat-based Indian Institute of Public Health. \"This is partly because we don't compile our mortality data properly.\"Prof Mavalankar should know. In May 2010, he found that the city of Ahmedabad had recorded 800 all-cause excess deaths - a measure of how many more people are dying than expected, compared to the previous few years - during a sweltering week of record-breaking temperatures. It was clear, he said, that heat was killing a lot of people. He said researchers compared the total number of deaths in the city to the maximum temperature recorded on the day, and laid down three colour coded alerts, with the red warning triggering above 45C.Prodded by these findings, Prof Mavalankar helped put together India's first heat action plan for the city of Ahmedabad. The plan kicked off in 2013 and advocated simple solutions like staying indoors, drinking lots of water before stepping out, and going to the hospital emergency if one felt sick. By 2018, he says, deaths from all causes had declined by a third in the hot, dry city.But the bad news is India's heat action plans don't seem to be working very well. (It is unclear whether the authorities in Navi Mumbai had a heat action plan in place when a million people reportedly were allowed to gather under the open sky.) A newof 37 heat action plans at the city, district and state levels by Aditya Valiathan Pillai and Tamanna Dalal of Centre for Policy Research, a think-tank, found a lot of shortcomings.For one, most of the plans were not \"built for local context and have an oversimplified view of the hazards\". Only 10 of the 37 plans studied seem to establish locally defined temperature thresholds, although it was unclear whether they took factors like humidity into account while declaring a heatwave. \"We recommend nuancing and localising the heat hazard definition by including climate projections,\" Mr Pillai told me. One way to do it is to have more automated weather stations at village levels, according to Prof Mavalankar.Second, the researchers found that nearly all the plans were poor at \"identifying and targeting vulnerable groups\". Farm and construction workers who toil in the open, pregnant women, the elderly, and children were most vulnerable to heat.Some three-fourths of India's workers work in heat-exposed jobs like construction and mining. \"Workers are losing the ability to safely and efficiently work outside as the planet warms. It's becoming too hot and humid for them to cool themselves enough when they generate a large amount of body heat when conducting heavy labour,\" says climate researcher Luke Parsons of Duke University, North Carolina.This becomes worse during heatwaves as there are fewer safe and productive work hours during the day, he adds.Mr Pillai says that India needs \"granular understanding of which neighbourhoods have most people working in jobs where they are exposed to heat and whether they could afford to buy a cooler or afford to skip work\". He adds: \"You might have a situation where 3% of the area of the city contained 80% of the vulnerable population.\"Also most of the heat action plans seem to be underfunded, had weak legal foundations with scant accountability, and were not sufficiently transparent, Mr Pillai and Ms Dalal found.Heatwave solutions can often be simple - planting enough trees in extremely exposed and hot areas or using design choices to reduce heat gain and increase heat loss in buildings.Sometimes simple surveillance solutions such asof a non-airconditioned hospital can protect lives, as a study in Ahmedabad found. Having worker protections in place to stop or slow work if it is too hot can help so people don't feel the need to keep working at high intensity when it's not safe, says Mr Parsons.India saw abetween 2000-2004 and 2017-2021, a recent study published in the medical journal, The Lancet, found. Exposure to heat also caused a loss of 167.2 billion potential labour hours among Indians in 2021, resulting in loss of incomes equivalent to about 5.4% of the country's GDP.But clearly, Indians are still not taking heat seriously enough.According to reports, the place in Navi Mumbai where the government ceremony had taken place had recorded a maximum temperature of 38C (100F) on Sunday. Yet, photos of the event showed thousands sitting directly under the sun with no roof or covering to offer shelter. Only a few carried umbrellas, or wrapped towels on their heads.\"I live in Delhi where the temperature can touch 50C and I see very few people even bring out their umbrellas,\" Mr Pillai says.Heat killing many more Indians now: Lancet studyScorching heatwave affecting India\u2019s poor the mostDelhi suffers at 49C as heatwave sweeps IndiaCoal shortage sparks India's power woes"

        "text": "You want to go vegan to help the planet, but you're not paying for the shopping. You think trains are better than planes, but your dad books the summer holiday.Young people are some of the world's most powerful climate leaders and want rapid action to tackle the problem.It makes a lot of sense. Higher temperatures and rising sea levels will impact the youngest alive today far more than older generations. But the power to act is often still in the hands of older people, including parents.Big changes are difficult, especially when they involve other people. Where do you begin? For this year's Earth Day, we spoke to people who have successfully had tricky climate chats at home. Here are their top tips:Eating less meat is one of the best ways to reduce our impact on the planet,Ilse, 17, lives in Brighton with her parents Antonia and Sally. They used to eat meat two or even three times a day. When Ilse was 13 she decided to do more about climate change and read that cutting out meat was a good start.Sally and Antonia were sceptical at first, worried about not getting enough protein or that Ilse was too young to make that decision.\"I was thinking, you're not doing the cooking. It's a big hassle for us,\" says Antonia, saying she worried about how to cook \"nice\" Chinese vegetarian meals. After a one-day-a-week trial, they quickly scaled up and after a year were totally meat-free.\"It was daunting at the beginning, but now it's really good. There's a million recipes out there,\" Antonia adds. Ilse jumps in to say her favourite now is vegetarian fajitas, and they cook a lot of roast vegetables or lasagne.Sally says that seeing the emotional impact of the topic on her daughter helped to persuade her it was the right thing for her family. \"It's actually seeing her really stick to that commitment, even though we knew that she liked the taste of meat. That made me stop and think,\" she explains.Ilse is part of Teach the Parent, a national campaign that encourages these conversations between generations. It was started by young people frustrated with the lack of international climate action and their feelings of powerlessness, says Melanie Kee from Students Organising for Sustainability UK who helps to run the project.Even if the first conversation goes badly, Ilse says keep going. \"Big lifestyle changes take time. If you bring it up every so often, it shapes people's attitudes in the long term.\"How we travel is a, but switching from driving or flying can potentially limit family holidays and cost more.Phoebe L Hanson, a 21-year-old student from Stafford, persuaded her family to go to Cornwall instead of flying abroad. Facts are important but she advises focussing on the reasons why you care.\"Say something like, 'I'm really scared about my future, these are the reasons I want to do something',\" she suggests.  Her mum Tracy explains that as Phoebe got older, their relationship changed from Tracy explaining facts to her to meeting in the middle to share knowledge.Present a solution, not just a problem, Phoebe explains. \"Give them options for something fun or exciting.\"\"Saying 'let's do this thing instead' is really good way to communicate,\" she suggests.She also says one answer to concerns about money is to discuss what type of world parents want children to inherit. \"People talk about how expensive trains are, but think about what the carbon emissions from taking a plane mean in the long term for us,\" she says.Radically reducing what we buy and throw away can improve our carbon footprint, but it can be time-consuming and difficult.Becky Little, who is 20 and a community carer in Worcester, persuaded her parents Rob and Ellen to reduce food waste and think more carefully about what they buy.\"Be well-informed about the things you want your family to start changing so they can see you care and have done some research,\" she says.Her parents were concerned about convenience but she focussed on the positive impacts. \"Explain why it will make their lives easier or cheaper,\" she suggests.\"Make connections with things they care about,\" she advises. Her family like to volunteer so they made meals using leftover food to donate to people in their local community.\"It's important to not go into it expecting them to change their whole lives. Small things can make a difference,\" she explains.Ilse, Phoebe and Becky all say that the conversations can be challenging at times but worth it. \"Taking action as an individual mean I've managed to feel a lot more in control of my future,\" Phoebe explains."

And he wished that children could enjoy playing and breathing freely outside,\" he said.The oil giant said at its annual meeting that it is continuing to reduce flaring at Rumaila.The BBC also foundfrom gas flaring at oil fields where BP, Eni, ExxonMobil, Chevron and Shell work.On Thursday, some of the UK's biggest pension funds voted against reappointing BP's chairman over a decision to weaken its climate plans, but the majority of shareholders backed Helge Lund.It comes after the energy giant cut back its target to reduce emissions by the end of the decade.As well as the dissenting votes there were also disruptions during the annual meeting from climate protestors.BP said it valued \"constructive challenge and engagement\".The five pension funds - Nest, the Universities Pension Scheme, LGPS Central, Brunel Pension Partnership and Border to Coast - are concerned that the new targets put BP financially at risk, as the company's fossil fuel projects are likely to lose value as the world moves towards net zero emissions.Nest, one of the five pension funds that voted against the reappointment of Mr Lund, told the BBC that there were concerns over BP's actions on reducing gas flaring, after seeing the BBC documentary Under Poisoned Skies.The five pension funds told the BBC that their vote was a.The pension funds have \u00a3440m invested in BP, which represents less than 1% of the company's total shares. But they manage the pensions of more than a third of the UK's workers so are an influential voice.Eni said it \"strongly rejects any allegation that its own activities are endangering the health of the Iraqi people\".Under Poisoned SkiesThe deadly impact of the oil giants' toxic air pollution on children and the planet is revealed in this BBC News Arabic investigation from the front line of climate change in Iraq.The documentary is availableand.BP in oil field where \u2018cancer is rife\u2019Revealed: Huge gas flaring emissions never reported"

        "text": "Two British companies are to fly an innovative, low-cost radar satellite - part of which will be knitted on a knitting machine.Called CarbSar, the mission will launch next year, and could help fill a gap in Britain's spying capacity.The satellite will use radar technology to see through cloud and will even work at night.The Ukraine conflict has shown the value of such systems, which have been used to monitor Russian positions.But Britain is the only permanent member of the UN Security Council without its own system.The two UK companies - Surrey Satellite Technology Limited and Oxford Space Systems - believe they can provide a similar, home-grown capability.They will start building their spacecraft this year - with government support - and with a launch on an American rocket already booked.This video can not be playedWATCH: This OSS video illustrates how the antenna would deploy in spaceSSTL has a long-established reputation for aerospace manufacturing; the real novelty is in the OSS radar antenna.It features a knitted tungsten wire mesh that's folded tightly for launch but which will spring out once in orbit to form a large umbrella-like shape.It's through this 3m-wide antenna/reflector that the satellite will image the ground.SSTL and OSS hope their CarbSar pathfinder will put them in a strong position to win future contracts to supply operational spacecraft to the UK government for both civil and military applications.The government is keen to see what the knitted satellites can achieve. Part of the funding has come from the National Security Strategic Investment Fund, which backs promising technologies that might be used for national security and defence.SSTL will build the bulk of CarbSar, including all the internal systems that drive the satellite, and the electronics that make the radar work.OSS will provide its deployable antenna/reflector, a prototype of which is already going through testing at the company's Harwell headquarters.The firm calls the structure a \"wrapped rib\" design.The gold-plated tungsten mesh is attached to a series of carbon-composite rods that can be wound radially against a central hub.The idea is that once released, the strain energy in these rods, or ribs, will naturally want to jump back into their straightened configuration, pulling the mesh into position in the process.Think of the builder's tape measure and how it always wants to snap longways when unrolled.OSS has a big rig at its factory where it practices stowing and deploying the antenna, time and time again.\"You need it to be as simple as possible because the more parts you have the more chance there is for something to go wrong,\" explains company CEO Sean Sutcliffe.\"It's also got to work every time, so you need to make sure it has enough strain energy to know that it's definitely going to come out fully - that it won't stall half way through. But then you also don't want the system to have so much energy that it tears itself apart or damages the satellite,\" he told BBC News.The mesh itself is remarkable - as is the process of manufacturing it.The yarn is almost invisible. Reels of it feed the industrial knitting machine in the factory which is operated by a former fashion lecturer from Denmark.Precision is everything. When the mesh is pulled tight it must conform to exacting standards.\"We've got a laser scanner and we scan the mesh before stowing and after deployment to check it hasn't deviated from the parabolic shape. We're seeking less than a millimetre's deviation,\" said OSS business development director Michael Lawrence.The UK has talked for some years about having a network of radar satellites.The Ministry of Defence has been promised money to procure them.But the sensing technology is very useful also in civil emergency situations, such as monitoring the extent of flooding or finding evidence of landslips and subsidence.Radar guarantees an image every time the satellite passes overhead because its vision is unobstructed by whatever the weather might be doing at the time.SSTL launched a radar satellite of its own in 2018 but it is hoping the CarbSar model will have added appeal. For one thing, it should have much higher resolution, seeing objects less than a metre across."

        "text": "Our ultimate demise is inevitable, but a growing number of experts believe how we feel in our later years may not be.They talk of \"healthspans\" - the number of healthy years of our lives.Life expectancy may have doubled over the last 150 years, but many of us have seen the undignified and devastating decline of our loved ones as they aged.To avoid that fate a new industry is emerging, promising a longevity revolution with techniques they say lead to healthier, longer lives.Business is booming for those in this space, with supplements being touted as having the ability to battle our cellular decline, and all sorts of hot and cold therapies trying to help us reduce inflammation and disease risk in our bodies.So I set out on a trip to the centre of it all, California, unsure as to whether I was arriving at the heart of a money-spinning cult, or the next frontier of medicine.Tech entrepreneur Bryan Johnson is spending millions a year trying to reduce his biological age - how old his body seems, rather than his actual chronological age, which is 45.There's a good reason for any of us to do this. Age is the highest risk factor for disease, whether it's cancer, type 2 diabetes, heart disease, or dementia, so if ageing as a whole could be delayed, then so could the risk of onset of these conditions. For him though, it's a sport.In Mr Johnson's luxurious Venice Beach home, a bedroom has been converted into a clinic where he spends many hours.He wakes at 5am, eating his first meal an hour later, followed by a second, and final one at 11am. This, combined with a forensically selected 54 pills, a mix of supplements and off-label medication, are all planned based on readings from a catalogue of tests.His days consist of a torturous exercise regime, monitoring and numerous treatments.He told me the all-over skin laser treatment he's been having has reduced his skin age by 22 years, the greatest age reduction in any part of his body.The aesthetics are just a small part of it all though, as he reminds me \"our skin is our biggest organ\".Mr Johnson was warm, logical and likeable. I left his house wanting to be (a bit) like him. Maybe I am already - I run 5km a day, try to avoid sugar, and test extreme tracking devices for fun.My colleagues considered Mr Johnson's existence joyless, so his life is clearly not for everyone.While his routine might seem extreme, every conversation I had still came back to lifestyle.\"Lifestyle is responsible for about 93% of your longevity - only about 7% is genetics,\" says Eric Verdin, chief executive of The Buck Institute for Ageing Research.\"Based on the data [if we live healthily], I would predict that most people could live to 95 in good health. So there's 15 to 17 [extra] years of healthy life that is up for grabs for all of us,\" he told me.The big question, which Mr Verdin and others are investigating, is what does a healthy lifestyle mean? Take exercise for example - should that be a daily stroll, or a HIIT class?The same goes for healthy eating. Is fasting as important as avoiding sugar? And what about a good night's sleep?You can't underestimate the obsession with sleep I came across. I met many people setting their alarms not to wake up in the morning, but to remind them to go to bed on time for a full eight hours.Well, we all set the bar at different levels.Mr Verdin practises what he preaches, his regime consisting of \"a whole lot of exercise, some fasting, good sleep, lots of social connections, very little alcohol\".His suggestion for others? \"Try to spend at least 14 hours of your 24 hours without ingesting any calories as this has a profound effect on your metabolism.\"The jury is out on how healthy this is for some women though.Keeping better track of our bodies as they age might help. Health risks could be flagged in advance and any new drugs could be applied just at the right time.Make it personalised, make it pre-emptive, make it better is the mantra.It was interesting to see that pretty much all of those working in longevity science wear more than one tracker themselves - commonly a smartwatch and a smart ring (way more convenient for sleep I can tell you - and these people are obsessed with prioritising sleep).For my part I've found health tracking illuminating. I am not diabetic, but have been fascinated by the findings of a continuous glucose monitor I wore for a while.The assumption is progress on longevity will come, albeit in a less sensational form than some may be hoping for.Experts suggest that a drug might emerge that will initially make a year or two's difference, then a few years more with the next generation, and so on.But along with such progress will come practical and ethical dilemmas.One fundamental question is whether ageing can be defined as a disease. This might simplify the approval of drugs by regulators, but risks labelling people over a certain age \"diseased\".The cost of such treatments may or may not (for developed medical systems anyway) be an issue, depending on what it turns out to be.Meanwhile, a healthier life is likely to lead to a few extra years of existence, so we may need to work longer.On my longevity learning mission, my expectations were upturned.I'd seen the sensationalist headlines, suggesting tech billionaires lounging on their yachts, deliberating over whether they fancied saving the world, going to space, or \"curing\" ageing.This wasn't the reality I saw. The wealthy have been giving money to medical research for years. This is just a new generation of wealth, and a potential new specialism of medicine.Plus it's really interesting, and affects us all.But right now, extending your healthspan involves hard work. As Silicon Valley-based journalist Danny Fortson put it: \"Exercise is hard, magic pills are easy, so that's why everyone is so excited about the pill.\"So I returned home feeling more determined than ever to live my healthiest life - sleep better, exercise without excuse, eat well, cherish social connections (yes, this was on the longevity prescription).With a bit of luck that might buy me enough time to benefit from any scientific breakthroughs."

        "text": "Scientists have obtained their best satellite assessment yet of the status of the world's glaciers.Europe's Cryosat spacecraft tracked the 200,000 or so glaciers on Earth and found they have lost 2,720bn tonnes of ice in 10 years due to climate change.That's equivalent to losing 2% of their bulk in a decade.Monitoring how quickly glaciers are changing is important because millions of people rely on them for drinking water and farming.The world's glaciers are distributed across all latitudes, not just at the poles. A few hundred are routinely measured at ground level - the best way to assess them. But for the vast majority, observation from space is the only way to keep an eye on how they are responding to climate change.It's important that we do that. Like the broader ice sheets, their whiteness reflects sunlight and helps cool the planet.And in many parts of the globe, glaciers also function as critical water reservoirs. More than 20% of the world's population is thought to be dependent in some way on summer melt waters that flow from glaciers - for drinking, for agriculture and to drive hydropower stations.Cryosat is a veteran European Space Agency Earth observer.It carries an instrument called a radar altimeter, which sends down microwave pulses to trace variations in height along the planet's surface - and in particular the changes in elevation of ice fields.This type of instrument works really well when monitoring the gentle undulations in the interior of Antarctica and Greenland. It finds it more tricky to measure the ice that runs across rugged terrain, such as in steep-sided valleys.But advances in data processing have enabled scientists to effectively increase the resolution and robustness of Cryosat's vision so that it can now track developments even in those hard-to-see locations.The study, reported on Wednesday, has applied this approach to the spacecraft's entire data archive to produce a global glacier assessment.The satellite's observations indicate the vast majority - 89% - of the ice loss seen between 2010 and 2020 was due to melting in an ever warmer atmosphere.Only 11% of the loss was the result of glaciers experiencing melting or increased flow because their fronts terminate in warmer ocean or lake waters.Alaska's glaciers have experienced the greatest losses. They've been losing more than 80bn tonnes a year, which equates to about 5% of the total ice volume in the region during the 10-year study period.This is very much an effect of warmer air temperatures.Places where glaciers appear to be eroding and moving faster because their fronts end in warmer waters include the Arctic - at Svalbard, the Norwegian archipelago - and in the Russian sectors of the Barents and Kara seas.Increasing ice discharge into the ocean accounts for over 50% of mass loss in these areas.\"This is a consequence of what is called the 'Atlantification' of the Arctic,\" explained Noel Gourmelen from Edinburgh University, UK.\"Usually, the surface waters of the Arctic Ocean are cold and fresh, but increasingly in some of these places the surface waters are becoming more salty and warmer as currents move up from the Atlantic. And this means glaciers are dumping more ice into the ocean,\" he told BBC News.This, of course, will add to sea-level rise which already threatens low-lying communities.Cryosat is an old spacecraft that has worked far beyond its design life. Scientists hope to get a few more years of operation from it but there's a recognition that it could fail any day now.The European Union is planning a long-term satellite series inspired by Cryosat, given the code name currently of Cristal.\"What we've shown you can do with Cryosat to measure glaciers worldwide augurs well for the Cristal mission,\" said Edinburgh colleague Livia Jakob.Ms Jakob, who led the research from her remote sensing company Earthwave, has been discussing its implications in Vienna, Austria, at the European Geosciences Union General Assembly, one of the world's biggest gatherings of Earth scientists."

For previous generation satellites, a feature in a storm had to be at least 1km across to be detected. The new spacecraft will track features as small as 500m in diameter.\"We can now see very fine structures,\" said Jochen Grandell from Eumetsat, the intergovernmental agency that manages Europe's weather satellites.\"You may have heard the term 'overshooting top', for example, which is a part of a thunderstorm's cloud development where you might see very strong updrafts and downdrafts. These are very rapidly changing, and they are very small as well. But they are also very powerful,\" he told BBC News.This video can not be playedWATCH: European countries share the cost of running the Meteosat systemEurope has had its own meteorological spacecraft sitting high above the planet since 1977. The new imager is the third iteration in the series.Meteosat-12 sits in a \"stationary\" position, keeping a permanent eye on Europe, the Middle East and Africa.It will return a full picture of the weather systems racing across Earth's surface at a rate of one every 10 minutes, five minutes faster than has been the case up to now. It also views the planet in more wavelengths of light. Sixteen instead of the previously available 12.The additional bands of light allow for true colour images. In other words, the pictures are much closer to what the human eye might perceive if looking down from the same vantage point.\"The first time we received the data, there were huge emotions because we could see the high quality of the sensor,\" recalled Eumetsat colleague Alessandro Burini.\"The optical quality of the images, of the radiometry, of the navigation - in other words the accuracy of the position of the individual pixels in an image - is really very good.\"The new third-generation system will eventually comprise a trio of spacecraft working in unison.A second imager will go up in 2026 to acquire more rapid - every 2.5 minutes - pictures of just Europe. Before that, in 2024, a \"sounding\" spacecraft will launch to sample the temperature and humidity down through the atmosphere.With replacement satellites already ordered for the first working threesome, Europe is guaranteed coverage well into the 2040s.The overall cost is expected to be about \u20ac4.3bn (\u00a33.7bn).If that sounds like a lot of money (and it is), it pales next to the value society accrues from accurate weather forecasting - in preventing loss of life, infrastructure damage and economic disruption.Repeated analyses have judged the benefits to be worth tens of billions every year across Europe as a whole.BBC Weather presenter and meteorologist Simon King was excited to see the new imagery.\"It's like going from standard definition to 4K,\" he said. \"The increase in resolution is quite remarkable. When you zoom in you can really see the cloud structure. And it's not just cloud, you can see very clearly as well the dust in the atmosphere, which is important for hurricane development for example.\"Nata\u0161a Strelec Mahovi\u0107 works at Eumetsat, training people how to use data from space. She's previously worked as a meteorologist in Croatia.\"Another example I would name as a consequence of higher resolution would be fog detection because we can now see fog even in very narrow valleys,\" she explained. \"And maybe another application I would emphasize is wildfire monitoring, as [Meteosat-12] will not only see much smaller fires better and see the smoke, but the channels on [Meteosat-12] will allow us to see the differences even in fire intensity.\"Testing of the satellite and ground systems will continue through this year. National forecasting agencies, such as the UK Met Office, Meteo France and DWD (the German Meteorological Service), should be ingesting Meteosat-12 information into their supercomputers on a routine basis early in 2024."

        "text": "Instead of traditional gold bands, Czech couple Jiri and Ondrej Vedral exchanged smart rings on their wedding day.Smart rings are wearable electronic devices with functions similar to smartwatches. They typically allow the user to monitor his or her heartbeat, and make a contactless payment.It's a fast-growing tech sector, reported to be seeingJiri and Ondrej's smart rings are, however, designed to be more romantic than most - they allow them to see and feel each other's heartbeat.Each ring is connected by Bluetooth to an app on the wearer's smartphone. And via the app two rings can be linked together.So every time Jiri presses his wedding ring, it both physically pulses with Ondrej's heartbeat, and displays the heartbeat as a moving red line. And the same in reverse for Ondrej.As long as their mobile phones are both connected to the internet, they get a real time heartbeat. If either is offline, they get the last recorded one.\"We were never into gold and diamonds,\" says Jiri. \"We wanted something different, so we liked the idea that this was something new. We feel like pioneers in this.\"The rechargeable ring, called the HB Ring, is made by Czech firm The Touch. Although the first iteration went on limited sale back in 2016, the company is now seeing an increase in global interest thanks to the wider surge in the smart ring sector.In addition, the business has this year launched a new parallel product - The Touch Locket. To be worn on a necklace, this has the same technology as the smart rings.Its target customers include engaged couples who might like the idea of being able to feel their loved one's heartbeat, but don't want to forgo having traditional wedding rings.Jiri and Ondrej are among the many couples now increasingly using tech in their wedding celebrations. From drones for wedding photography, to digital tools to help with wedding planning tasks, such as managing the budget and seating arrangements, tech has infiltrated many important aspects of the wedding day.The wedding tech trend is growing as a result of people conducting so much of their lives on their smartphones, says Zoe Burke, the lead editor for UK wedding planning website Hitched.co.uk.\"I think people just take it for granted now that you'll be able to plan your wedding through your phone. You probably met your partner through your phone,\" she says.A third of couples in the UK are now said to use WhatsApp to invite guests to their wedding, and 60%is a series exploring how technological innovation is set to shape the new emerging economic landscape.Some people are even now using artificial intelligence (AI) software to write their wedding vows or speeches. US-based wedding planning website Joy recently launched an AI tool that can do all this for you.Called \"Wedding Writer's Block Assistant\", it is based on ChatGPT, the chatbot founded by the San Francisco-based tech firm OpenAI.Vishal Joshi, co-founder and chief executive at Joy, says that rather than killing off the romance involved in writing vows or speeches, the aim of the AI tool is to make life easier for people who have difficulty putting their feelings into words.\"We did a survey, and found 89% of respondents find it overwhelming to start writing their wedding material,\" says Mr Joshi. \"The AI tool is not supposed to replace human emotions, but for many people it's helpful.\"The global coronavirus pandemic helped pave the way for tech-based weddings, with couples that didn't postpone their nuptials getting married over Zoom or livestreaming their ceremony to guests at home.But virtual weddings now suffer from their association with Covid-19 restrictions, according to Ms Burke. \"People have moved away from livestreaming weddings. They don't want to be reminded of that time,\" she says.For couples dealing with spiralling costs brought about by higher inflation, utilising tech can save money, such as sending out e-invitations instead of posting out paper ones. This also has an environmental benefit.Rohita Pabla, a wedding planner based in London, says: \"It's about cost saving and being environmentally conscious. More and more couples are thinking about the environment.\"Making an impact on social media during the big day is also, perhaps unsurprisingly, now a huge focus for many, with couples and guests posting videos on TikTok or Instagram during the wedding and the following reception.One new development in this direction is the growing trend of hiring \"gif booths\" for the reception. These are photobooths that take short bursts of photos to create gifs, or moving images. The user then simply enters his or her mobile number, and the gif is immediately sent to their phone.\"Some [couples] want the pictures to get picked up and shared over multiple different platforms,\" adds Ms Pabla. \"They want to be the Instagram couple.\"But couples also need to cater for their less tech savvy wedding guests, or those who prefer to get their invitations the traditional way. Ms Pabla, who specialises in planning South Asian weddings, says that many couples she works with ensure they observe certain traditions alongside using tech-based solutions.For example, in traditional Indian weddings, it's customary for the bride and groom to give family members and older guests a physical wedding invitation in person.\"So the couple will get a few copies of invitations made and those will be for parents and grandparents,\" says Ms Pabla. \"But for their peers the same age they'll just send them a digital invite.\"Mr Joshi adds that wedding tech can be used to \"make everything easier and much more interesting\". Yet he cautions that at the same time you need to avoid the risk \"of losing the charm and the romance of what real weddings are about, which is essentially bringing friends and family close together\"."

        "text": "It's an elegantly simple solution to an age-old problem: to protect crops from hazards, keep them covered.Nets are commonly used to keep out pests in vegetable production, particularly in high-value areas like seeds.Yet in fruit production the use of nets is still being explored and tested, according to Mirella Aoun, an agronomist and researcher at Bishop's University in Quebec, Canada, who has been studying agricultural nets for over a decade.Prof Aoun explains that initially fruit producers placed nets over trees primarily to protect them from hail damage. Now they are experimenting with nets that can protect against insects.The mesh size of insect-proof nets is determined by the local conditions, including the nature of the insects.Of course that could shut out the insects that farmers really do want - pollinators like bees.One option is to apply the nets after the pollination period. Another is to open the nets during the day, while bringing in beehives.Tree nets are particularly well established in French and Italian apple orchards, wherelimit the movements and egg laying of codling moths. This has helped farmers to get rid of persistent pests and reduce their use of costly and environmentally damaging chemical pesticides.There are benefits to fruit lovers as well. \"When you know that you have less pesticide residues from crops that are under exclusion nets, it's good news for consumers,\" says Prof Aoun.Nets are also seen as a way of tackling the effects of climate change. Warmer conditions have seen the resurgence of some types of insects and diseases.Some regions are seeing more intense periods of drought and heavy rain and nets can help with that.For instance, depending on the location, the type of net, and the way it is used, a netting system can shield against the solar radiation that leads to heat stress and inhibits trees' photosynthesis.But the introduction of a net could mean a more humid environment around the tree - not helpful for crops prone to fungal diseases in wetter climates like the northeastern US and Canada.But some researchers are, where a treatment using a botanical pesticide essentially makes the nets water repellent.Photoselective (coloured) nets can also affect the penetration of light. Dark, opaque nets reduce light intensity but not light quality.Pearl-coloured nets can scatter light better so that it reaches more parts of the vegetation. Meanwhile, blue, red and yellow nets filter certain solar wavelengths and thus can stimulate specific responses in plants related to fruit quality.Fine-tuning the net usage often leads to an increase in high-calibre fruit, according to Prof Aoun. Ashas shown, trees covered by coloured shade nets can produce larger and more vividly coloured fruit.Nets are not always the answer. They may not be appropriate for smaller, more varied orchards. Nor are they necessary for all climate conditions.Also, the nets used for fruit trees are typically made of polyethylene, which isn't ideal for a world attempting to move away from plastic dependence.One of the companies working on non-plastic nets is Texinov, a French technical textiles firm. Texinov is researching various types of biodegradable nets, such as ones made from flax.It has already introduced a biodegradable net made out of polylactic acid (PLA), which is produced from fermented corn. Industrial composting is needed to break down this type of net, which sales manager Adrien Etienne says is about 10% more expensive than a conventional net.Mr Etienne says that the biodegradable nets are currently more popular in Europe than in North America. This may be linked toinsecticide use. \"The nets, I think, will become more and more popular because insecticides are less popular,\" Mr Etienne says, for instance among French cherry farmers.The upfront cost has been a barrier for some farmers. \"Nets are of course a little bit expensive compared to insecticides,\" Mr Etienne acknowledges.Texinov's cheapest net sells for around \u20ac0.50 (44p) per square metre for private use in France, according to Mr Etienne. This type of net lasts for only one or two seasons, although the heavy climate protection nets can last much longer. Durability depends on factors like solar exposure. \"The nets are more and more fragile because of the sun,\" says Mr Etienne.Overall, Prof Aoun says that prices are dropping as products become more varied and accessible. \"In general the positive impact of the net is overwhelming the negative side,\" she summarises.Jean-Marc Rochon heads the apple tree nursery P\u00e9pini\u00e8re Rochon in Quebec and is keeping an eye on advances in netting.\"In my eyes, this technology is more in the development and improvement phase rather than in large-scale application,\" he says.For Mr Rochon to begin using nets on his apple trees, the cost of the netting wouldn't be the only factor. \"I see it more as a way of rethinking our ways of doing things,\" he explains.To be viable for his nursery, the netting would have to be reliable and not create a work overload. It would also need to be useable on large orchard sections.Clearly, technological refinements and communication will be necessary to convince more fruit growers that netting would be useful.But Prof Aoun believes, \"As we move toward more climatic challenges and unpredictable weather, protective cultivation using nets is the way forward.\""

        "text": "This video can not be playedWatch: AI 'godfather' Geoffrey Hinton tells the BBC of AI dangers as he quits GoogleA man widely seen as the godfather of artificial intelligence (AI) has quit his job, warning about the growing dangers from developments in the field.Geoffrey Hinton, 75, announced his resignation from Google in a statement to the New York Times, saying he now regretted his work.He told the BBC some of the dangers of AI chatbots were \"quite scary\".\"Right now, they're not more intelligent than us, as far as I can tell. But I think they soon may be.\"Dr Hinton also accepted that his age had played into his decision to leave the tech giant, telling the BBC: \"I'm 75, so it's time to retire.\"Dr Hinton's pioneering research on neural networks and deep learning has paved the way for current AI systems like ChatGPT.In artificial intelligence, neural networks are systems that are similar to the human brain in the way they learn and process information. They enable AIs to learn from experience, as a person would. This is called deep learning.The British-Canadian cognitive psychologist and computer scientist told the BBC that chatbots could soon overtake the level of information that a human brain holds.\"Right now, what we're seeing is things like GPT-4 eclipses a person in the amount of general knowledge it has and it eclipses them by a long way. In terms of reasoning, it's not as good, but it does already do simple reasoning,\" he said.\"And given the rate of progress, we expect things to get better quite fast. So we need to worry about that.\"In the New York Times article, Dr Hinton referred to \"bad actors\" who would try to use AI for \"bad things\".When asked by the BBC to elaborate on this, he replied: \"This is just a kind of worst-case scenario, kind of a nightmare scenario.\"You can imagine, for example, some bad actor like [Russian President Vladimir] Putin decided to give robots the ability to create their own sub-goals.\"The scientist warned that this eventually might \"create sub-goals like 'I need to get more power'\".He added: \"I've come to the conclusion that the kind of intelligence we're developing is very different from the intelligence we have.\"We're biological systems and these are digital systems. And the big difference is that with digital systems, you have many copies of the same set of weights, the same model of the world.\"And all these copies can learn separately but share their knowledge instantly. So it's as if you had 10,000 people and whenever one person learnt something, everybody automatically knew it. And that's how these chatbots can know so much more than any one person.\"Matt Clifford, the chairman of the UK's Advanced Research and Invention Agency, speaking in a personal capacity, told the BBC that Dr Hinton's announcement \"underlines the rate at which AI capabilities are accelerating\".\"There's an enormous upside from this technology, but it's essential that the world invests heavily and urgently in AI safety and control,\" he said.Dr Hinton joins a growing number of experts who have expressed concerns about AI - both the speed at which it is developing and the direction in which it is going.In March,, including the tech billionaire Elon Musk - called for a pause on all developments more advanced than the current version of AI chatbot ChatGPT so robust safety measures could be designed and implemented.Yoshua Bengio, another so-called godfather of AI, who along with Dr Hinton and Yann LeCun won the 2018 Turing Award for their work on deep learning, also signed the letter.that \"we need to take a step back\".But Dr Hinton told the BBC that \"in the shorter term\" he thought AI would deliver many more benefits than risks, \"so I don't think we should stop developing this stuff,\" he added.He also said that international competition would mean that a pause would be difficult. \"Even if everybody in the US stopped developing it, China would just get a big lead,\" he said.Dr Hinton also said he was an expert on the science, not policy, and that it was the responsibility of government to ensure AI was developed \"with a lot of thought into how to stop it going rogue\".Dr Hinton stressed that he did not want to criticise Google and that the tech giant had been \"very responsible\".\"I actually want to say some good things about Google. And they're more credible if I don't work for Google.\"In a statement, Google's chief scientist Jeff Dean said: \"We remain committed to a responsible approach to AI. We're continually learning to understand emerging risks while also innovating boldly.\"This video can not be playedWatch: What is artificial intelligence?It is important to remember that AI chatbots are just one aspect of artificial intelligence, even if they are the most popular right now.AI is behind the algorithms that dictate what video-streaming platforms decide you should watch next. It can be used in recruitment to filter job applications, by insurers to calculate premiums, it can diagnose medical conditions (although human doctors still get the final say).What we are seeing now though is the rise of AGI - artificial general intelligence - which can be trained to do a number of things within a remit. So for example, ChatGPT can only offer text answers to a query, but the possibilities within that, as we are seeing, are endless.But the pace of AI acceleration has surprised even its creators. It has evolved dramatically since Dr Hinton built a pioneering image analysis neural network in 2012.Even Google boss Sundar Pichai said in a recent interview that even he did not fully understand everything that its AI chatbot, Bard, did.Make no mistake, we are on a speeding train right now, and the concern is that one day it will start building its own tracks.AI creators must study consciousness, experts warnAI could affect 300 million jobs - reportIs the world prepared for the coming AI storm?Advanced AI risk to humanity - technology leaders"

        "text": "The US will not delay a deadline for airlines to refit planes with new sensors to address possible 5G interference, despite concerns the cut-off date could cause travel disruption.Transport Secretary Pete Buttigieg said on Tuesday that airlines were told the 1 July deadline would remain in place.Airlines have warned that they will not be able to meet the deadline and may be forced to ground some planes.Telecoms firms have previously delayed 5G rollout to allow airlines to adapt.In the US, the radio frequencies being used for 5G are in part of the spectrum known as C-Band.The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and aviation companies have previously raised concerns that C-Band spectrum 5G wireless could interfere with aircraft altimeters, which measure a plane's height above the ground.In a call with airline companies on Tuesday, Mr Buttigieg told them to work aggressively to retrofit their planes before the deadline, according to the Reuters news agency.Concerns about 5G interference led to some disruptions at US airports last year.Major tech companies, like Verizon and AT&T, agreed last year to delay the rollout of 5G technology until 1 July 2023 to allow airlines time to retrofit their altimeters.The decision came after several previous delays.The International Air Transport Association (IATA), a trade group representing more than 100 airlines that fly in and out of the US, has said the decision not to extend the deadline makes summer disruptions more likely.\"Supply chain issues make it unlikely that all aircraft can be upgraded by the 1 July deadline, threatening operational disruptions during the peak northern summer travel season,\" the organisation said on Tuesday, adding that the estimated cost to upgrade planes is $638m (\u00a3511m).\"Airlines did not create this situation. They are victims of poor government planning and coordination,\" said Nick Careen from the IATA.Airlines have previously said they want 5G signals to be excluded from \"the approximate two miles of airport runways at affected airports as defined by the FAA\".Phone companies have spent tens of billions of dollars upgrading their networks to deploy the 5G technology, which they say brings much faster internet services and greater connectivity.Technology companies have said 5G is safe and have accused the aviation industry of fearmongering and distorting facts.In the EU, networks operate at lower frequencies than those which US providers are planning to use - reducing the risk of interference. 5G masts can also operate at lower power.Nevertheless, some countries have taken further steps to reduce possible risks.In France, there are so-called \"buffer zones\" around airports where 5G signals are restricted, while antennas have to be tilted downwards to prevent potential interference.The UK's Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) has said \"there have been no confirmed instances where 5G interference has resulted in aircraft system malfunction or unexpected behaviour\".But it has stressed that \"different national mobile telecommunication strategies may mean that some [countries] have a higher threat exposure than others\".In a separate development, the FAA on Tuesday proposed new rules for many Boeing aircraft due to the possibility of new 5G interference.The proposed rules affect nearly 20,000 planes worldwide. They require revised flight manuals, bans on some landings, and new operating procedures for landings and approaches when dealing with 5G interference.A representative for Boeing told Reuters that the company \"continues to work with suppliers, regulators, the airlines and telecom companies to ensure long-term stability and help mitigate operational restrictions where possible\".Why your new phone could disrupt flights and ground planesMobile firms agree another 5G delay at US airportsBoeing and Airbus warn US over 5G safety concernsUS airlines warn of impending 5G flight disruption"

That could include age verification.Lucy Crompton-Reid, chief executive of Wikimedia UK, an independent charity affiliated with the foundation, warns some material on the site could trigger age verification.\"For example, educational text and images about sexuality could be misinterpreted as pornography,\" she said.But Ms MacKinnon wrote: \"The Wikimedia Foundation will not be verifying the age of UK readers or contributors.\"As well as requiring Wikipedia to gather data about its users, checking ages would also require a \"drastic overhaul\" to technical systems.If a service does not comply with the bill, there can be serious consequences potentially including large fines, criminal sanctions for senior staff, or restricting access to a service in the UK.Wikimedia UK fears that site could be blocked because of the Bill, and the risk that it will mandate age checks.It was \"definitely possible that one of the most visited websites in the world - and a vital source of freely accessible knowledge and information for millions of people - won't be accessible to UK readers (let alone UK-based contributors)\", wrote Ms Crompton-Reid.There are currently 6.6 million articles on Wikipedia, and she said it was \"impossible to imagine\"  how it would cope with checking content to comply with the bill.She added: \"Worldwide there are two edits per second across Wikipedia's 300-plus languages.\"The foundation has previously said the bill would fundamentally change the way the site operated by forcing it to moderate articles rather than volunteers.It wants the law to follow the EU Digital Services Act, which differentiates between centralised content moderation carried out by employees and the Wikipedia-style model by community volunteers.On Tuesday, the House of Lords debated an amendment from Conservative peer Lord Moylan that would exempt services \"provided for the public benefit\", such as encyclopaedias, from the bill.Heritage Minister Lord Parkinson said he did not think this would be feasible, but added that Wikipedia was an example of how community moderation can be effective.He said the bill did not say that every service needed to have age checks, and it was expected that \"only services which pose the highest risk to children will use age verification technologies\".Ms Crompton-Reid told the BBC that while Lord Parkinson's remarks \"reassured\" her , the charity did not want to be relying on future goodwill and interpretation of legislation.It would continue to urge that protections to community moderation were in the bill through measures such as an exception for public benefit websites like Wikipedia, she said.A government spokesperson told the BBC the bill had been \"designed to strike the balance between tackling harm without imposing unnecessary burdens on low-risk tech companies\".Communications watchdog Ofcom will enforce it and would \"focus on services where the risk of harm is highest\".The government also believes it is unlikely Wikipedia would be classed as a category one service, those that would be subject to the bill's strictest rules.WhatsApp: Rather be blocked than weaken securityWikipedia fears 'harsh' Online Safety Bill plansChanges to Online Safety Bill 'not ruled out'"

        "text": "Two days before Christmas, TikTok called London-based journalist Cristina Criddle to tell her two of its employees in China, and two in the US, had viewed user data from her personal account without her knowledge or consent.\"It was just really chilling and horrible and, personally, quite violating,\" she says.\"I was at my family home with my teenage sister, teenage cousins - and they all use TikTok all of the time. They were like, 'Whoa, should we be worried?'\".What happened to Cristina - a Financial Times technology correspondent and a friend and former colleague of mine - is what TikTok and its parent company, ByteDance, have consistently denied happens at all, which is why she has decided to tell BBC News about it.TikTok has confirmed members of its internal audit department looked at the location of Cristina's IP address - the unique number of a device - and compared it with the IP data of an unknown number of their own staff, to try to establish who was secretly meeting with the press. They \"misused their authority\" to do this and were acting unauthorised.Cristina does not know for how long she was tracked, or how often, but she does know it happened last summer.\"If my location was being monitored 24/7, that's not just limited to my actions at work - which wouldn't be OK even if it was - but this was in my personal life as well,\" she says. It was when I was out with my friends, when I was going on holiday, all of that stuff's in there.\"The real threat and the real chilling thing is that I was just trying to do my job.\"Cristina's TikTok account was on her personal mobile handset - and in the name of her cat, Buffy. Her own name and occupation were not mentioned in the bio.She had about 170 followers and over three years or so had uploaded some 20 videos of Buffy, viewed, on average, a couple of hundred times.Like most social-media networks, TikTok collects quite a lot of information about its account holders, including:Western users' data is never accessed or stored inside China, it says. And the staff responsible for the data breach of Cristina and a handful of other Western journalists, last year, were fired for misconduct.TikTok owner Bytedance said it \"deeply regrets\" what was \"significant violation\" of its code of conduct and was \"committed to ensuring this never happens again\".Last summer, Cristina had been talking to TikTok staff unhappy with company practices. The data breach had failed to identify her sources, TikTok said.She says it may also have breached the EU's strict General Data Protection Regulation, which states users have to actively consent to how their data is used. There are large penalties for companies failing to comply.For now, Cristina has kept her account open because she still needs to be able to access TikTok for work - but the app now lives on a dummy handset kept at her workplace. And she has curtailed both her own and Buffy's social-media use across other platforms as a result of what happened.\"I have really had to think about my safety - mostly my digital safety,\" she says.\"I'm super-careful now. I have to make sure that there is no chance that my devices are being tracked. I have to make sure that my sources are aware of the possible challenges to their safety as well.\"Cyber-security expert Prof Alan Woodward, from Surrey University, said this level of tracking \"cannot be described as accidental or even incidental\".\"Someone had to do some extra digging to work out that the cat account was in fact Cristina,\" he said.TikTok is fighting for survival in the US and there is restricted access to it on official devices in several other countries. ByteDance is headquartered in Beijing - although, it also has offices in Europe and the US - and there are concerns it could share Western users' data with the Chinese state if requested.Nevertheless, it remains wildly popular, with more than 3.5 billion downloads worldwide."

        "text": "Scroll through TikTok, and there\u2019s a dupe for seemingly everything.Don\u2019t want to spend $98 on lululemon leggings? Try these $27 alternatives. If a Skims bodysuit is too much, a smiling influencer will show you exactly where you can find a similar one in their Amazon storefront. Even dupes for the $45 Stanley water bottle exist.The hashtag #dupe \u2013 or cheaper alternatives to household names or luxury brands, but not considered counterfeits because most don\u2019t make an effort to fake logos \u2013 has racked up billions of views. And one pricey brand is taking the trend head on by offering the real thing.This weekend, athleisure giant lululemon is hosting a dupe swap at the Century City Mall in Los Angeles. Bring a knock-off pair, lulu said, and they\u2019ll swap it out for the black Align High Rise Pant 25\u201d.The Align Pants, which launched in 2015, have something of a cult. Fans of lululemon claim the real ones are lightweight and buttery-soft. But they are also one of the most duped products on TikTok.Go on TikTok, and you\u2019ll see awearing Aligns and a $27 Amazon dupe side-by-side (their Amazon storefront is linked in the bio). \u201cLulu who?\u201d another said, holding up two tank tops with \u201cliterally\u201d the exact same stitching.Because, instead of hiding a knockoff\u2019s true origins, it\u2019s pretty cool to find a dupe now. Call it recession-core or Gen Z\u2019s anti-consumerism sentiments, but #dupe has amassed more than 3.5 billion views on TikTok.shows young people loudly (and ironically) shouting \u201cDUPE!\u201d through store windows.Before, finding knock offs was a lowkey way to way to find affinity to a luxury brand. But now \u201cit\u2019s a flex to have the dupe,\u201d Northwestern marketing professor Jacqueline Babb said.Lulu has been \u201chyper aware\u201d of dupe culture, its Chief Brand Officer Nikki Neuburger said in an interview with CNN Business. (The #lululemondupe tag has 180 million views alone, the  company said.)\u201cWe saw it as a really fun way to play into something that is a real part of our culture, but in a way that really puts the focus back on the original,\u201d she said. The LA location was chosen strategically \u2013 it\u2019s a center for creators and content generation. Similar events are planned in London, Shanghai and Seoul.Lulu is making sure customers don\u2019t go hold on to their fakes, which will be sent to a textile recycling company. \u201cThe premise of the event is to trade in your qualifying dupe product and experience lululemon\u2019s Align Pant,\u201d says the website.Though lululemon has acknowledged dupes exist, there isn\u2019t much brands can do to stop their popularity through social media, Northwestern marketing professor Alexander Chernev said.\u201cYou have people who are able to tell the story or inform other people about what\u2019s in fashion, influence this behavior, and they can do it faster than the original product,\u201d Chernev said, adding it\u2019s difficult for companies to legally protect and keep up with copies of their design.Dupes could come from dubious places and can easily be found online., one of the brands with thousands of reviews hailing it as a Lulu dupe, doesn\u2019t have a clear store origin, though the leggings are made in China and available on Amazon.Amazon has \u201cno tolerance for counterfeit items,\u201d a spokesperson said, and has measures in place to pursue bad actors who attempt to use social media to sell them.Some TikTokkers are turning dupes into a major source of income.22-year-old Hannah Slye\u2019s account, whose bio says she \u201ccan\u2019t stop buying things,\u201d has more than 98,000 followers and about 3.7 million likes. During the two-day Prime Early Access Sale in October, Slye earned upwards of four to five thousand dollars through her affiliate links.Slye\u2019s favorite dupe is a gold chain that resembles a necklace from Christian Dior \u2013 but no one has called her out for the fake. It\u2019s just about having the designer inspired look.\u201cI\u2019m from a very, very small town in Pennsylvania,\u201d Slye said. \u201cSo you know, we don\u2019t see a lot of people wearing designer around here.\u201dSome experts argue dupe culture encourages a trend cycle that makes products out of date within months. Why invest in a high-quality piece, one could say, when they could mindlessly scroll and purchase the dupe with free two-day shipping?Impulse buying has become a chronic way to spend time, Baylor University researcher on consumer behavior James Roberts said, exacerbated by constant access to cheaper goods.\u201cThey send you products are consistent with algorithms, lots of products for things you need for lower prices, and it can become a vicious cycle,\u201d Roberts said.Some legacy brands can be immune to this \u2013 Patagonia and Nike are examples, Babb said, of brands that have a lot of meaning. And Gen Z, who tends to be more concerned about where their money goes, is probably more attuned to brands like this than they\u2019d like to admit, Babb said.\u201cPatagonia wants you to wear their jacket until it rips, then they fix it for you. That is much more resonant with Gen Z,\u201d Babb said.Indeed, there\u2019s a lot of loyalty to legacy brands. Though lululemon may be leading in dupe hashtags on TikTok, the Align line that began in 2015 remains its top seller, the company said."

And it came just weeks before Texas will mark a year since 19 students and two teachers were killed atThe gunman in Saturday\u2019s massacre was killed by an Allen Police Department officer who was at the mall on an unrelated call, police said. Investigators believe the shooter was acting alone.Geoffrey Keaton was eating at the mall\u2019s Fatburger restaurant Saturday with his daughter when they heard gunshots approaching. They were rushed to a corridor and then outside, where Keaton said he saw people down on the sidewalk.\u201cIt was traumatic,\u201d he told CNN Sunday evening. \u201cIt was fast. It was definitely not anything that you expect or (are) prepared for because who prepares for a thing like that?\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t expect to go to the mall and lose your life,\u201d Keaton said.There have been 202 mass shootings across the US within the first five months of this year, according to the.

A patient transferred to a children\u2019s hospital was also in fair condition, while the ninth patient was also treated at a local hospital, police said.Authorities are investigating whether the gunman was motivated by right-wing extremism, a senior law enforcement source familiar with the investigation tells CNN.While authorities have not determined a specific motive, the source said the deceased suspect was found with an insignia on his clothing that read \u201cRWDS,\u201d which authorities believe may stand for \u201cRight Wing Death Squad.\u201d8 killed and 7 wounded in Texas mall shooting. The gunman is also deadSome members of extremist groups have been seen in public in recent years with patches bearing the letters \u201cRWDS,\u201d according to the Southern Poverty Law Center, an organization that monitors and reports on extremism.A photo obtained by CNN shows what appears to be the gunman lying on the ground after being shot, with an AR-15-style firearm nearby. He is clad in black body armor and appears to have several extra magazines strapped in his chest gear.In addition to the AR-15-style weapon found near him, Garcia had at least one other weapon on him when he was fatally shot in front of the mall, the senior law enforcement source said. Police also found multiple weapons in his car.Garcia underwent firearms proficiency training for his work as a commissioned security officer, according to the Texas Online Private Security database, which is maintained by the Texas Department of Public Safety.Garcia was approved to work as a security guard in Texas from April 2016 until April 2020, when his license expired, according to the database. His profile shows he worked for at least three security companies. None of those companies immediately responded to requests for comment.According to the database, Garcia received Level II and Level III security training. The former covers security laws in Texas; the latter, which is required for all commissioned security officers and personal protection officers in Texas, includes firearm training and the demonstration of firearm proficiency, according to Jonah Nathan, vice president of Ranger Guard, a security guard service in Texas not affiliated with Garcia\u2019s employers.In 2018, Garcia also completed a separate firearms proficiency training course that requires six hours of continuing education, according to the Texas DPS database.Private security guards in Texas undergo background checks and are disqualified if they have committed certain crimes such as assault, burglary or sexual offenses, among others, according to the Texas DPS website and state codes.They are also disqualified if they have been dishonorably discharged from the US military; have been found incompetent by a court of law; or have been required to register as a sex offender.

Other witnesses reported sheltering in place for up to two hours as police cleared the scene.Kimberly Blakey and her 14-year-old daughter were among the crowd trying to flee the parking lot during the attack.\u201cThe shooting happened over and over and over again. It was nonstop,\u201d she said.As gun violence reaches record levels in the US, an underlying trauma may be building upIn her haste to get away, Blakey initially drove toward the gunfire before her daughter told her to turn around. But as she drove toward the exit, she said, they became stuck behind a scrum of other cars trying to do the same.That\u2019s when she felt her car get hit twice by gunfire.\u201cI told my daughter to get down,\u201d Blakey said. \u201cShe did, and I could hear her start praying.\u201dThe pair managed to get out of the parking lot and didn\u2019t stop until they got home.\u201cWe were on a mission to get out of there,\u201d Blakey said.CNN\u2019s Ashley Killough, Keith Allen, Andy Rose, Sara Smart, Paradise Afshar, John Miller,  Yahya Abou-Ghazala, Bob Ortega, Curt Devine, Michelle Watson, Phil Gast and Emma Tucker contributed to this report."

Charges have not been filed in the case, which isby the Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg.Before his death, Neely had been on a NYC Department of Homeless Services list of the city\u2019s homeless with acute needs \u2013 sometimes referred to internally as the \u201cTop 50\u201d list \u2013 because individuals on the list tend to disappear, a source told CNN.The list is generally not made public but is compiled in hopes that outreach organizations will be on the lookout for those individuals and alert the city\u2019s homeless services department to intervene, the source said.The agency places additional focus on trying to find those on the list and give them the help they need, the source explained.CNN has reached out to NYC DHS for comment.The man who held Jordan Neely in a fatal chokehold 'never intended to harm' him, his attorneys saywho eked out a living as a Michael Jackson impersonator in Times Square and on New York\u2019s subways.

Nanney noted that scholars have identified trans alumni of women\u2019s colleges as early as the 1980s.But it wasn\u2019t until 2013 \u2013 when Smith College denied admission to Asian American trans woman Calliope Wong \u2013 that a wave of on-campus activism and fraught conversations caused several women\u2019s colleges to reconsider their policies on trans and nonbinary prospective students, Nanney said. This included Smith, whichto include trans women in 2015.In the years since, almost all of the approximately 30 women\u2019s colleges in the United States have opened their admissions to trans women, though less than a third have adopted policies open to trans men, according toby Nanney.While the institutions still widely refer to themselves in official communications as \u201cwomen\u2019s colleges,\u201d many students, staff members and alumni have voluntarily adopted the term \u201chistorically women\u2019s college\u201d to reflect that their campuses have evolved to serve more gender-diverse communities, Nanney said.\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of resistance, especially from leadership, to use the term \u2018historically women\u2019s college\u2019 because they think that connotes the idea that these colleges are no longer \u2018women\u2019s colleges,\u2019\u201d Nanney said.The yearslong struggles over trans inclusion are often tense, as some students and alumni say they want their college policies to reflect the reality on campus \u2013 where trans students are an important part of the community \u2013 while some students, administrators and alumni argue the changes would negate the college\u2019s history and threaten its mission to serve women. Some opponents also argue admitting trans men would effectively make the college co-ed.But as conservative groups and GOP lawmakersof anti-trans legislation aimed at limiting rights to gender expression and affirming health care, some trans students at women\u2019s colleges say their campus communities provide a critical safe haven as they increasingly fear for their safety and personal wellbeing.CNN spoke to several trans and nonbinary students who attend women\u2019s colleges who shared their experiences and explained how they have found affirming communities on campus, even as some still struggle to feel fully accepted by some students and administrators.Avery realized he was trans at the end of a gap year he took before college \u2013 and about a month before he was supposed to start his first semester at Smith. Withdrawing or transferring so close to move-in day seemed unthinkable, he says.So he decided to keep his identity private when he first arrived on campus, waiting to see how he might be received and taking time to become more secure in his newfound self. Soon, he met several nonbinary people in his housing community and decided to come out.\u201cEveryone was just like, \u2018Oh my gosh! Congrats. Good for you for coming out. We support you here. You belong here.\u2019 Which was really, really nice,\u201d Avery said.Though people who identify as mento apply for admission to Smith, students who transition after matriculation are able to stay and complete their degree.Understanding and supporting the transgender communityAvery is now a sophomore and has built a supportive community in his student-living house, where he often sits in the living room knitting Nordic-style sweaters and chatting with friends.While he feels the students at Smith are overwhelmingly supportive, Avery still is misgendered often. And because Smith\u2019s admissions policy does not include trans men, he said, \u201cIt definitely makes me feel like I have to justify my existence on campus.\u201dBut he says he believes trans men would also benefit from an environment aimed at providing equal education to those who have been marginalized because of their gender.\u201c(Trans men) have had negative experiences with other people because of our gender just in the same way a lot of cis women have also faced discrimination because of their gender,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re not a big, scary threat taking away your women\u2019s colleges. We\u2019re just students and people who want to learn and want to be in a place that is safe for us.\u201dHunter already knew he was trans but still had not come out when he was recruited to Wellesley College as a student athlete. Though he had barely heard of the small Massachusetts school, a visit to its campus quickly made clear that it was the right place for him, he says.\u201cIt seemed like an environment where everyone was trying to reach their goals in harmony rather than competitive, cutthroat. And above all else, it seemed like a place that I could be at and would feel safe,\u201d said Hunter, who asked that CNN use only his first name.He now identifies as a trans man and contributes to the Wellesley Trans Archive, a student-run Tumblr page that documents stories of past and current trans students.After the student referendum was rejected by administrators, Hunter says, he was \u201cdisheartened\u201d by president Johnson\u2019s response, which he felt implied, \u201c\u2018It doesn\u2019t matter what\u2019s happening. I\u2019m not going to listen to you.\u2019\u201d\u201cThe administration at Wellesley, they\u2019re not nearly as forward thinking or as progressive or as open to change as the student population here is,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s the student community that has continued to lift me up and support me, and that has been so incredible beyond my wildest dreams.\u201dAs he prepares to graduate, the threat of transphobia and anti-trans policies around the country has been weighing on Hunter, he says.\u201c(Wellesley) feels like a protected space, though the administration isn\u2019t affirming. You know, I\u2019m surroundedfar and wide by people who embrace me and love me and accept me.\u201dKit Rapier, a senior at Agnes Scott College in Decatur, Georgia, said the large LGBTQ community on campus was a key reason they decided to attend.\u201cThat was something I just really wanted to feel safe in, and I didn\u2019t think that I could get that with a traditional public university as much as a small liberal arts, historically women\u2019s college,\u201d Rapier said.The college\u2019s admissions are open to prospective students of all genders except for cisgender men.It was not until Rapier settled in at Agnes Scott that they came out as nonbinary and transmasculine \u2013 meaning they aretrans and identify most with masculine gender identity and expression.\u201cI was in, finally, a safe space to realize that,\u201d they said.\u201cI never even thought of leaving Agnes, even once I didn\u2019t identify with womanhood,\u201d Rapier said. \u201cThose spaces (women\u2019s colleges) are still important to trans people and always have been. They\u2019re just a safer space to be in, it feels like. Trans men and lesbians, I mean, there\u2019s a history of solidarity there.\u201dAs Rapier and their peers witness GOP-led efforts to limit trans rights, they are particularly concerned about the wave of laws banning gender-affirming care, especially for young trans people and children. And ashave also moved to restrict treatment at all ages, they also worry about being able to access reliable and supportive health care through adulthood.On campus, however, the threats seem to have strengthened LGBTQ students\u2019 bonds, Rapier says.\u201cI think it\u2019s definitely bolstered community values here, especially within LGBT organizations,\u201d Rapier said. \u201cWe\u2019re sending out messages and holding spaces for people to talk and grieve.\u201dMyles Walsh, a transmasculine, first-year student at Mount Holyoke College in South Hadley, Massachusetts, says he was viciously bullied by men at his Maine high school when he came out as trans. Going to a women\u2019s college, he thought, would be \u201ca more comfortable option.\u201d\u201cI wanted to just be known as Myles and be accepted,\u201d he said.\u201cI was going to have the opportunity to meet trans and nonbinary students who I could connect with and finally be with people who are like me, which was super exciting,\u201d Walsh said.So he chose Mount Holyoke, which was one of the first women\u2019s colleges to open its admissions to all students except for cisgender men. It now describes itself as a \u201c.\u201d\u201cIt is a lot more accepting\u201d than his high school, Walsh said. But even in the more open-minded environment, Walsh sometimes feels his masculine gender expression makes him stick out and attracts uncomfortable attention.\u201cI feel like eyes are always looking at me, and when I speak in class \u2013 like on the first day of classes \u2013 people are like, \u2018Whoa, that sounds like a man\u2019s voice. What is he doing here?\u2019\u201d he said.Walsh says he sometimes feels isolated when he hears other students talking about the way he dresses or his hobbies, which include making music to document his voice deepening while on testosterone. Even still, he says he has found support that he may never have gotten at a co-ed college.\u201cThere are people who are really wanting to learn and are going through similar experiences who really are great to me,\u201d Walsh said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m so lucky for that. I don\u2019t think I would receive that at other schools as much as I do here.\u201dKay Miranda, a senior and neuroscience major at Bryn Mawr College in Pennsylvania, knew they were nonbinary before college. Once they got to campus, they were excited to see that some of their professors were trans or nonbinary and were relieved at the ease with which people accepted their identity.\u201cHaving students ask me my pronouns as opposed to me having to advocate for it for myself was such a breath of fresh air. \u2026 It just felt like it was like the same as asking your name,\u201d Miranda said.The collegeit admits trans and cis students who identify as women, nonbinary people who were assigned female at birth, \u201cintersex individuals who do not identify as male\u201d and  \u201cindividuals assigned female at birth who have not taken medical or legal steps to identify as male.\u201dMiranda found affirming groups of LGBTQ people of color on campus and have become more confident in their identity, Miranda says. But the national onslaught of anti-trans legislation still lives in the back of their mind.\u201cI feel like sometimes there\u2019s a cognitive dissonance with myself of like, I\u2019m feeling great on campus and feeling great as a senior and feeling great as Kay. But the parts of me that I feel so confident and feel so loved for are topics of debate in the halls of Congress and in all of these different states,\u201d they said.Miranda made sure to get their top surgery \u2013 a gender-affirming procedure in which a person\u2019s breast or chest tissue is removed \u2013 before graduating because they were confident their peers and professors would be supportive. They were also unsure if they\u2019d be able to access affirming care and a safe community after graduating.\u201cI\u2019m worried of never finding a career or a job or a home that I\u2019ll feel safe in,\u201d Miranda said.Though several women\u2019s colleges have adopted admissions policies welcoming trans and nonbinary people, Nanney \u2013 the scholar on trans experiences at gender-selective colleges \u2013 said such changes are only the first step toward welcoming such students on campus.\u201cI do not believe that these policies are the be all and end all towards trans inclusion and trans justice on campus. In many ways, they are just the way to get your foot in the door,\u201d they said.On-campus support requires a holistic approach, Nanney says, and includes resources such as widely available restroom and locker room spaces, access to affirming health care and counseling, and a way for students to easily change their name and pronouns in college systems.Nanney pointed to Mount Holyoke as a leader in implementing trans support systems on campus, including athat allows students to easily designate which name and pronouns they would like to appear across the college\u2019s directories, email and other online systems. The college also offers afor LGBTQ students who lose support from their families after coming out.When colleges implement such support programs, Nanney says, it is almost always because students pushed for them, as the students at Wellesley have done with their referendum.\u201cIt just absolutely amazes me and astonishes me to see what can happen from the ground up,\u201d they said. \u201cStudents (at Wellesley) are showing that this is the college that they strive to have \u2013 that this is their vision of inclusion. And I think that\u2019s really powerful.\u201dCorrection: A previous version of this story used the incorrect pronouns for Maggie Nanney. It has been fixed."

Authorities say it\u2019s unclear whether the crash was intentional.Seven people were found dead at the scene and 10 were taken to hospitals, Martin Sandoval, a Brownsville police spokesperson, told CNN.Later Sunday, an eighth person died due to injuries from the crash, Sandoval told CNN.Sandoval said several migrants were among the dead and Border Patrol is working to confirm the identities of the victims. The FBI is also assisting with the investigation.Police are set to provide more information about the crash during a press conference on Monday at 10:30 am CT.CNN interviewedcenter in December. At the time, the center\u2019s director told CNN that migrants from all over the world were beginning to stay at the shelter and they were seeing an uptick in stays. The shelter is equipped to house and feed 200 people, according to its website.Witnesses at the scene detained the driver until officers arrived, Sandoval said during a Sunday news conference. He said the driver of the vehicle received medical care and has been arrested on a reckless driving charge. \u201cMore than likely\u201d there will be other charges added, Sandoval said.The driver, identified as a Hispanic man, is being \u201cuncooperative\u201d with authorities, according to Sandoval. He has given authorities multiple names, and police have had to fingerprint him in hopes of finding his identity \u2013 which takes more time, Sandoval said.Authorities have a blood sample from the driver and a toxicology test will be ordered, Sandoval said. It\u2019s unclear how long it will take for authorities to get those results, he said.Brownsville police are investigating with the help of Border Patrol, he added.Sandoval said authorities are still investigating whether the crash was intentional or accidental. He said witnesses described seeing the driver ignore a red light, drive up on a curb and run over a group of people waiting at the bus stop.The shelter has been housing immigrants while they wait for more permanent housing, he said.Brownsville is located on the southern tip of Texas, just across the Rio Grande River.

The pandemic-era policy allowed immigration agents to swiftly return migrants to their home countries. Officials have predicted a rise in immigration in coming weeks when the restrictions are lifted Thursday.Victor Maldonado, the director of the Ozanam Center, told CNN that about 20 to 25 migrants were sitting on the curb waiting for a bus across the street from the shelter. He said surveillance video captured the deadly wreck with footage showing a vehicle driving very quickly, crashing about 30 feet from where the migrants were sitting and then losing control.Police took Maldonado\u2019s copy of the surveillance video, he said.The migrants were from Venezuela and had arrived at the shelter about two or three days ago, Maldonado said.Maldonado said after the crash, he and a staff member at the shelter ran outside to find a very graphic scene, with body parts spread across the area.\u201cI\u2019ve got a staff [member] who is in shock,\u201d Maldonado said, adding that he, too, was in shock."

        "text": "House Foreign Affairs Chairman Michael McCaul is threatening to hold Secretary of State Antony Blinken in contempt of Congress over  his panel\u2019sinto the US withdrawal from Afghanistan, according to a letter the Texas Republican sent him Friday, a copy of which was obtained by CNN.The letter, the latest escalation in the panel\u2019s investigation, comes afterin March for a dissent cable written by US diplomats in Kabul criticizing the Biden administration\u2019s plans to withdraw troops in 2021.The chairman claimed the information the State Department has turned over is \u201cinsufficient,\u201d saying the department is \u201cnow in violation of its legal obligation to produce these documents and must do so immediately,\u201d according to the letter. McCaul is giving Blinken a third deadline of May 11 to voluntarily comply \u2013 or he will move forward with contempt proceedings, he said.A State Department spokesperson called the panel\u2019s latest move \u201cunnecessary and unproductive action.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate that despite having received a classified briefing on the dissent channel cable as well as a written summary that the House Foreign Affairs Committee continues to pursue this unnecessary and unproductive action,\u201d spokesperson Vedant Patel said in a statement. \u201cNevertheless, we will continue to respond to appropriate oversight inquiries and provide Congress the information it needs to do its job while protecting the ability of State Department employees to do theirs.\u201dMcCaul views the dissent cable as a crucial document for his committee\u2019s investigation. Blinken, however, has told the panel that he opposes sharing the full document due to concerns it could have a dangerous impact on diplomats\u2019 use of the channel, which is a confidential way for them to share concerns with top State Department officials.McCaul has pushed back the subpoena deadline multiple times \u2013 from April 4 to April 21 and then to May 1 \u2013 following a series of back-and-forth communications with the State Department.The Biden administration has made some moves to offer Congress more information about the withdrawal. The State Department provided the House Foreign Affairs Committee with a roughly one-page summary of the four-page dissent cable, as well as a summary of the department\u2019s official response to the document.The department also held a classified briefing for members of the panel last month to discuss the dissent cable. But McCaul and other committee Republicans maintain the briefing did not represent compliance with the subpoena and some members argued they still have unanswered questions.\u201c[I]t is inherently problematic for the Department, which is the subject of the Committee\u2019s investigation, to be permitted to withhold key material evidence and substitute its own abbreviated characterizations of that evidence for the original documents. The Committee is aware of no other type of investigation (whether law enforcement, Inspector General audit, or internal compliance) where this is standard operating procedure,\u201d McCaul wrote in his Friday letter.McCaul also laid out a series of options he characterized as \u201ca potential accommodation\u201d for Blinken\u2019s compliance, including that the committee \u201cwill accept production of the dissent cable and official response with all names and other identifying marks redacted.\u201d As an alternative, he said, the panel is \u201cwilling to review in camera an unredacted copy of the cable and official response, with an agreement that it will not publicly disclose the names of any signatories without that signatory\u2019s permission.\u201dA third option McCaul offered is that the committee will accept an \u201cin camera review of the cable and response with only names redacted.\u201d The chairman argued the options should address the department\u2019s concerns regarding confidentiality of the signatories\u2019 identities."

Previous administrations have deemed such a move as unworkable.\u201cThere is no way to protect our financial system and our economy other than Congress doing its job and raising the debt ceiling,\u201d Yellen said.Adeyemo also tamped down the feasibility of using the 14th Amendment when asked about it Sunday, saying the \u201cthe only way\u201d to \u201cguarantee\u201d that the US can pay its bills is to raise the debt ceiling.Biden, whose White House has said that it will accept only a clean proposal to raise the debt limit, is set to sit down with House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, a California Republican, and other congressional leaders on Tuesday to discuss the debt ceiling.House Financial Services Chairman Patrick McHenry expressed \u201cmodest pessimism\u201d Sunday at the prospect of a debt deal coming together.The North Carolina Republican suggested on CBS\u2019 \u201cFace the Nation\u201d that the ultimate compromise to raise the debt limit would look \u201ca lot like the bill we passed out of the House,\u201d adding that \u201cat this stage of the game, the one key ingredient I don\u2019t have is what the administration would come to terms with.\u201dThat bill, which would raise the nation\u2019s $31. 4 trillion borrowing limit by an additional $1.5 trillion and slash federal spending, is unlikely to be taken up by the Democratic-led Senate. But the measure is primarily aimed at boosting Republicans\u2019 efforts to negotiate with Democrats.House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York called the GOP proposal a \u201cransom note\u201d on Sunday, labeling it the \u201cDefault on America Act.\u201d\u201cEither Republicans want us to accept these dramatic cuts or accept a catastrophic default on our nation\u2019s debt. That is what is the unreasonable position and hopefully in a few days Republicans will come to their senses and do what\u2019s right by the American people,\u201d Jeffries said on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press.\u201dArizona independent Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, meanwhile, said Republicans and the White House must explore options for raising the debt ceiling because neither position has the votes to pass.\u201cThe reality is the bill that Kevin (McCarthy) and his colleagues passed through the House is not going to be the solution. The votes do not exist in the United States Senate to pass that. But what the president is offering is not a realistic solution either. There\u2019s not going to be just a simple clean debt limit. The votes don\u2019t exist for that,\u201d Sinema told CBS on Sunday.She said the two sides need to negotiate a solution that will \u201cprotect the full faith and credit of the United States of America.\u201d"

        "link": "https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/08/politics/public-service-loan-forgiveness-biden-waiver/index.html",
        "text": "Nearly 610,000 student loan borrowers have received debt relief from the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program since October 2021, when the Biden administration temporarily expanded eligibility.The program promises to wipe away remaining federal student loan debt after an eligible government or nonprofit worker makes 10 years of monthly payments.Another 6,000 borrowers in the program will see their loans discharged soon. Altogether, those cancellations will total $42 billion of federal student debt, the Department of Education said Monday.Have you received student debt forgiveness since Biden took office in 2021? Tell usJust 7,000 borrowers had been approved for relief under the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program during the Trump administration, according to the department.The targeted debt relief program was created in 2007 but was riddled with problems, andof people who applied had received forgiveness before 2021, prompting the Biden administration to make changes.\u201cSince Day One, the Biden-Harris Administration has worked relentlessly to fix a broken student loan system, including by making sure we fulfill the promise of Public Service Loan Forgiveness for those who have spent a decade or more serving our communities and our country,\u201d Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona said in a statement.\u201cThe difference that Public Service Loan Forgiveness is making in the lives of hundreds of thousands of Americans reminds us why we must continue doing everything we can to fight for borrowers and why families cannot afford to have progress derailed by partisan politicians,\u201d he said.The administration\u2019s separate,program is currently held up in court after several Republican-led states sued, arguing the executive branch does not have the power to implement the proposed debt relief.In October 2021, the Biden administrationthat expanded eligibility for the PSLF program.Previously, eligibility hinged on having a federal Direct Loan and being enrolled in an income-driven repayment plan, which sets payments based on income and family size. Those with Federal Family Education Loans, which were made by private lenders but backed by the government, did not qualify.But under the temporary waiver, it no longer mattered what kind of federal student loans borrowers have or what repayment plans they were enrolled in. All payments were eligible for the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program if the borrower was working full time for a qualifying employer.The waiver ended afterOctober 2022, though some applications filed under the waiver are still being processed.The department is making some other changes to the PSLF program to make it easier for borrowers to apply.The newly updatednow allows borrowers to sign and submit their PSLF form digitally and track its status throughout the process, the Department of Education said Monday.Previously, borrowers had to take multiple steps to submit their PSLF form. In most cases, they had to print and sign their form, obtain signatures on the printed form from one or more employers, and then submit the completed form and related documents \u2013 sometimes by mail or fax.Now, borrowers can complete the entire process digitally on StudentAid.gov via the PSLF Help Tool, including requesting an e-signature from employers.\u201cThe improved PSLF Help Tool is another step forward to modernize and simplify the process for people who rely on us to carry out the law effectively,\u201d Federal Student Aid Chief Operating Officer Richard Cordray said in a statement.The Biden administration is makingto the PSLF program, which are set to take effect in July.The changes will allow borrowers to receive credit toward PSLF on payments that are made late, in installments or in a lump sum. Prior rules only counted a payment as eligible if it was made in full within 15 days of its due date.Under the new rules, time spent in certain periods of deferment or forbearance will count toward PSLF. These periods include deferments for cancer treatment, military service, economic hardship and time served in AmeriCorps and the National Guard.The new rules will also simplify the criteria to meet the requirement that a borrower be a full-time employee in a public sector job. The new standard will consider full-time employment at 30 hours a week. In particular, the change will help adjunct faculty at public colleges qualify for the program.Under the revised regulations, borrowers will receive some credit for past payments when they consolidate older loans into federal Direct Loans in order to qualify for the program. Previously, borrowers lost all progress toward forgiveness when they consolidated. After July, they will receive a weighted average of existing qualifying payments toward PSLF.President Joe Biden\u2019s separate, one-time student debt forgiveness program, which promises up to $20,000 of debt relief for some low- and middle-income borrowers, is.The Supreme Court is expected to issue its decision in the case over whether the program is constitutional in late June or early July.But the Biden administration has also streamlined student debt relief for people who were defrauded by for-profit colleges as well as borrowers who are permanently disabled.In total, the administration has approved more than $66 billion in loan relief to nearly 2.2 million borrowers to date, according to the Department of Education.Meanwhile, payments on most federal student loanssince March 2020 due to a pandemic-related relief effort. That pause is expected to end later this year."

Watched by cheering and waving crowds, the couple rode in the Diamond Jubilee State Coach drawn by six horses. The coach was built in 2012 to commemorate the 60th anniversary of the reign of Queen Elizabeth II.According to Barb, which analyzed audience figures across 11 television channels and services, the number of viewers peaked at 20.4 million just after midday when the King received his crown.The BBC took the biggest share by far, with viewership across its BBC One and Two channels peaking at around 15 million, according to numbers released by the UK public broadcaster.The lady in blue, vanishing princes and the crowning event: Key moments from the coronationBut the overall peak viewing figure was 9 million fewer than the number recorded for Queen Elizabeth II\u2019s funeral, according to UK media reports, while the BBC audience was down about 5 million from the 20 million that tuned into BBC One for that service last September.In 1953, more than 20 million people watched the late Queen being crowned, according to estimates based onat the time. Cameras were installed in Westminster Abbey for the first time to cover that coronation, which theas the first mass television event in the UK.Charles III\u2019s coronation also underperformed compared with the wedding of his eldest son in 2011. The wedding of Prince William and Catherine Middleton attracted a peak viewership of 20 million on the BBC, at the end of the ceremony in Westminster Abbey, according to the broadcaster.Scores of foreign dignitaries, British officials, celebrities and faith leaders gathered in the abbey for Saturday\u2019s coronation. Still, the 2,300-strong congregation was much smaller than in 1953 when temporary structures had to be erected to accommodate the more than 8,000 people who attended.Following the service, 4,000 armed forces personnel, accompanied by 19 bands, took part in the largest UK military procession for 70 years, cheered on by thousands of spectators.Some anti-monarchy demonstratorsSaturday\u2019s coronation.

        "text": "Attorneys for brothers Erik and Lyle Menendez, who were convicted of the, say new evidence shows the convictions and life sentences should be overturned, according to court documents filed Wednesday.At their high-profile trialsdecades ago, the brothers did not deny killing Jose and Kitty Menendez, but argued that they should not be convicted of premeditated murder because they acted in self-defense after enduring a lifetime of abuse by their father. The brothers were retried and found guilty in 1996 after a first trial ended with jurors deadlocked.In a habeas petition filed in Los Angeles Superior Court, the brothers\u2019 attorneys say that a letter sent by Erik to his cousin eight months before the murders shares details of his father\u2019s abuse.The petition also says Roy Rossello \u2013 who was in the Latin boy band, Menudo, in the 1980s \u2013 says he was raped by Jose Menendez,who was an executive at RCA Records.The Los Angeles County District Attorney\u2019s office, which prosecuted the two trials in the 1990s, told CNN in a statement, \u201cWe have received the habeas petition in the Menendez matter and it\u2019s currently under review.\u201dThe letter from Erik Menendez to his cousin, Andy Cano, in December 1988 says \u201cIts (sic) still happening Andy but its worse for me now.\u201dThe Menendez brothers have been reunited in prison\u201cHe\u2019s so overweight that I can\u2019t stand to see him,\u201d the letter says. \u201cI never know when its (sic) going to happen and its driving me crazy. Every night I stay up thinking he might come in. I need to put it out of my mind. I know what you said before but I\u2019m afraid. You just don\u2019t know dad like I do. He\u2019s crazy! He\u2019s warned me a hundred times about telling anyone especially Lyle. Am I a serious whimpus? I don\u2019t know I\u2019ll make it through this. I can handle it, Andy. I need to stop thinking about it.\u201dThe letter was discovered by Jose Menendez\u2019s younger sister and Andy\u2019s mother, Marta Cano, who shared it with journalist Robert Rand in April 2018, who then shared the letter with Erik Menendez\u2019s former appellate counsel Cliff Gardner the same month, the court document says.A review of court records shows the letter was not presented at either of the two trials, the document says.Gardner also discovered last year that as part of a documentary, Rossello said in an interview \u201che was anally raped twice, and orally copulated, by Jose Menendez when Roy was only 13 or 14 years old\u201d while he was in New York City performing shows, the document says. Rossello shared the assaults in a sworn declaration in an exhibit filed with the habeas petition.The attorneys argue these two pieces of evidence counters prosecutors\u2019 narrative that Jose Menendez was not violent or the type of person who would abuse children.\u201cIn short the new evidence not only shows that Jose Menendez was very much a violent and brutal man who would sexually abuse children, but it strongly suggests that \u2013 in fact \u2013 he was still abusing Erik Menendez as late as December 1988. Just as the defense had argued all along,\u201d the court document says.Attorneys are asking the court to either vacate the conviction and sentence against the two brothers, or permit discovery and an evidentiary hearing when they can provide proof, the document says.CNN has reached out to the two attorneys for comment.CNN\u2019s Chloe Melas and Cheri Mossburg contributed to this report."

        "text": "A species that conservationists once saved from the brink of extinction is now facing a new powerful threat: avian flu.In a little more than a month,21 critically endangered California condors have died of avian flu,The disease has been found in northern Arizona, among the bird\u2019s Southwest flock, which straddles the Arizona-Utah border, says the service. Avian flu has not yet been confirmed among any condors in Utah, California, or Baja California, Mexico.After a 100 year absence, California condors are released back into the Northern RedwoodsThe deceased birds, which officials counted from March 30 to May 5, included eight breeding pairs, according to the news release. Four condors with avian flu are currently recovering at, an Arizona wildlife rescue.The deaths have likely set conservation efforts back by a decade or more, the Peregrine Fund, which manages the Southwest flock, told CNN in an email.\u201cBecause the Condor is slow to mature, taking up to eight years before they can produce young, and with an average of one young every other year,\u201d even a single loss in the wild can have \u201ca big impact,\u201d said Chris Parish, the non-profit\u2019s president and CEO. \u201cThis will change recovery as we know it.\u201d\u201cWe will need to double down on causes of mortality that we can control or change rates of, like lead poisoning, and be better prepared with (hopefully) vaccines and greater infrastructure to respond to events like this in the future,\u201d he went on.The US Fish and Wildlife Service has said it was working to manage the outbreak and may consider vaccinating the endangered birds.The Peregrine Fund added it wasn\u2019t sure how influenza entered the condor population. The organization explained that condors are important to preserve because they \u201cprovide a critical ecological service\u201d by \u201ceating dead animals that can be a source of disease transmission to other wildlife, livestock, and even humans.\u201dThe species are also considered sacred to the, California\u2019s largest Native American tribe.Japan is running out of space to bury chickens culled over bird fluThe condors, which are one of the world\u2019s largest birds with a wingspan of 9.5 feet, almost went extinct in the 1980s,. By 1987, the tiny population of condors left in the wild was placed into a captive breeding program in an attempt to bring the species back from the brink.In 1992, the service began releasing captive-born condors into the wild. The population has slowly started to bounce back: As of 2020, there were a total of 504 condors in the world with 175 living in captivity and 329 living in the wild,But they still face serious threats, including lead poisoning, which the birds contract after scavenging on animals that have been shot with lead ammunition.Experts have said this may beof avian flu ever in the US. The disease has affected almost 60,000 captive poultry across 47 states,Risk to humans is limited \u2013 only one human infection has been detected in the US,"

        "text": "New York City Mayor Eric Adams announced Friday the city will ship willing migrants to other neighboring New York communities ahead ofexpected to arrive in the city following the expiration of Title 42 next week.Adams said the new program \u201cwill provide up to four months of temporary sheltering in nearby New York counties, outside of New York City, to single-adult men seeking asylum who are already in the city\u2019s care.\u201dThe program will launch with two hotels located in the small hamlets of Orange Lake and Orangeburg, with the potential to expand, the mayor said. Adams\u2019 spokesperson, Fabien Levy, told CNN there is capacity for up to three hundred migrants between the two hotels initially, with the potential to \u201cexpand.\u201dOrange Lake is a hamlet in Orange County in upstate New York. The population was 9,770 at the 2020 Census. Orangeburg is a hamlet in the town of Orangetown in New York\u2019s Rockland County, where around 4,600 people live, according to Census data.Why the US expects a border surge and is deploying troops\u201cDespite calling on the federal government for a national decompression strategy since last year, and for a decompression strategy across the state, New York City has been left without the necessary support to manage this crisis,\u201d Adams said. \u201cWith a vacuum of leadership, we are now being forced to undertake our own decompression strategy.\u201dAdams said the mayors and county executives in both areas have been notified. CNN has reached out to local leaders in both Orange Lake and Orangeburg for their response to the mayor\u2019s plan. CNN has also asked New York Gov. Kathy Hochul for her response to the mayor\u2019s plan to transport migrants outside the city.Rockland County Executive Ed Day expressed outrage over Adams\u2019 plan on Friday.\u201cThis is absurd and we will not stand for it,\u201d Day said in a statement. \u201cThere is nothing humanitarian about a Sanctuary City sending busloads of people to a County that does not have the infrastructure to care for them.\u201dThe Rockland County executive said he was initially provided with \u201cfew other details\u201d about the City\u2019s plan for asylum seekers, aside from that they will be housed at a local hotel. He said he later found out that New York City officials \u201cplans to house about 340 adult males\u201d in Orangeburg for four months with plans to secure them work permits to integrate into the community.\u201cWork permits typically take up to six months on average for asylum seekers to obtain and the County believes it is unlikely this will be achieved in four months,\u201d Day said. \u201cThere is nothing coordinated about the situation but rather its duplicitous of Mayor Adams to surprise a locality that busloads of migrants are heading to their town.\u201dThe statement goes on to criticize the chosen destination in Rockland where the migrants will be bused to, saying \u201cit has no resources within walking distance.\u201dThe announcement comes on the heels of an internal briefing memo obtained and first reported by CNN that shed light on a variety of options city officials were weighing to help weather the expected surge.Tents in Central Park, a retrofitted airplane hangar at John F. Kennedy Airport and building temporary tiny homes were some of the options noted in the memo, which says the city is anticipating 800 migrants will arrive in the city every day from the southern border after Title 42 is scheduled to lift Thursday. Since last spring, the city has processed tens of thousands of migrants and a total of 37,500 people are currently in the city\u2019s care, the memo says.The 5-page draft memo, which outlines the city\u2019s needs and possible \u201csolutions,\u201d says New York City is already seeing an increase in arrivals. On Wednesday alone, officials recorded approximately 500 arrivals. Title 42, the pandemic-era rule that allows immigration agents to swiftly return migrants to Mexico, is scheduled to end on May 11.US Customs and Border Protection officials already have seen an uptick in migrants crossing the US-Mexico border in anticipation of the expiration of Title 42, CNN has reported. There have been around 7,000 daily encounters on the US southern border in recent days, a number expected to rise in the coming weeks.CNN spoke with three different sources in Adams\u2019 administration who confirmed the authenticity of the planning document. A fourth source at one of the city agencies that would be tasked with helping to set up shelter and other resources for migrants, confirmed the agency had reviewed the memo. The document details a series of potential options the Adams administration is exploring that are not yet finalized, the sources explained to CNN.The document outlines possible locations for housing migrants at existing buildings including the campuses of York and Medgar Evers colleges; the YMCA at the Park Slope Armory in Brooklyn; and at a massive 135,000 square foot recreation center in Staten Island.Listed as another possible \u201csolution\u201d is a proposal to retrofit unused airplane hangars at John F. Kennedy International Airport, which would require help from the state and the Port Authority, which operates the airport, to build out \u201cdormitory style residential services.\u201dAccording to the document, the Adams administration is also considering erecting tents in the city\u2019s public parks and public parking lots. The memo lists Central Park, Prospect Park in Brooklyn and Flushing Meadows-Corona Park in Queens as possible options. The parking lots at Citi Field \u2013 the home of the New York Mets \u2013 and the Aqueduct Racetrack are also on the list of possible options. Coney Island and Orchard Beach, visited by hundreds of thousands of New Yorkers in the summer months, are also listed as options.Levy, Adams\u2019 spokesperson, declined to comment on the specific proposals outlined in the document but told CNN, \u201cWhile we do not discuss internal deliberations, we\u2019ve been clear that the burden of caring for asylum seekers shouldn\u2019t fall on any one city alone.\u201dLevy told CNN the city resorted to housing migrants who arrived this week in \u201cold NYPD training gyms\u201d after running out of shelter space.\u201cWe have reached our limit of new shelters that we can open right now, and we currently have no other option but to temporarily house recent arrivals in gyms,\u201d Levy said. \u201cThis week alone, we received hundreds of asylum seekers every day, and with Title 42 set to be lifted next week, we expect more to arrive in our city daily. We are considering a multitude of options, but, as we\u2019ve been saying for a year, we desperately need federal and state support to manage this crisis,\u201d he said.DeSantis vows Florida will transport more migrants from border to other statesBuilding structures in public places such as the city\u2019s parks is likely to face fierce criticism from local officials and advocates who have at times been critical of the city\u2019s response to the migrant crisis. In the last year, as he has struggled to respond to the needs of arriving migrants, Adams has said the city\u2019s budget would be affected. He said it might be necessary to cut back on social and municipal services for residents in order to meet the need. New York City officials project they will spend $4.3 billion on the influx of migrants by the end of June 2024.Included in its list of possible solutions, the memo also details a proposal to erect \u201ctemporary housing in containers or tiny homes.\u201d The document references similar models used in New Jersey and London to serve homeless populations there.The memo also lists options the city has previously used or considered using in the last year, including erecting tents on Randall\u2019s Island, and using cruise ships to house migrants.An administration official who would only speak on background, because they weren\u2019t authorized to speak publicly, said, \u201call of these items are being discussed. While we may not yet know what may come to fruition, we have to let New Yorkers know that all options are on the table, especially given the fact that more than 60,000 asylum seekers have arrived in New York City since last year.\u201dAdams has repeatedly requested aid from Washington, saying migrant arrivals in New York City and other major cities in the northeast equate to a humanitarian crisis that should be handled by the federal government. Adams continues to criticize the Biden administration, saying the federal government has \u201cabandoned\u201d the city to deal with the migrant crisis on its own.\u201cNew York has received the brunt, close to 60,000 of those who are coming to the city to participate in the American Dream and we\u2019re not giving them the resources,\u201d the mayor said Thursday during an unrelated event.Adams also recently said the financial burden of the migrant crisis is \u201cdecimating the foundation of our city\u201d and has said every municipal service in New York City will be impacted.Adams wants FEMA to stop giving money to cities that use funds to send migrants to NYCOn Friday, some city officials voiced their disappointment after the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) awarded $30.5 million dollars in humanitarian aid funding \u2013 only a fraction of the amount that the city requested in March.\u201cDespite the City\u2019s $350 million request, FEMA\u2019s initial grant provides a paltry $30.5 million, which is not anywhere close to enough to cover the cost of assistance for asylum seekers,\u201d said a joint statement from New York City Council Speaker Adrienne Adams and Finance Chair Justin Brannan.US Rep. Dan Goldman called the allocation of funds from FEMA\u2019s Emergency Food and Shelter Program \u201cwoefully insufficient,\u201d adding that he vows to continue to work with his colleagues and the Adams administration to push for \u201csufficient\u201d federal funding.\u201cNew York has spent more than $1 billion to support the more than 60,000 migrants that have come to our city seeking a better life, yet FEMA has allotted only $30.5 million to New York City to contribute to this expense,\u201d Goldman said in a statement Friday. \u201cIt is incumbent on the federal government to pay its fair share for these unexpected immigration-related expenses.\u201dThe Department of Homeland Security announced the allocation of the humanitarian support in a statement and named Texas and California as the top three recipients.\u201cThis first round of funding was focused primarily on the needs of border communities due to the urgencies they are confronting,\u201d the department said. \u201cSeveral interior cities also received funding. The City of New York received the most of any interior city by a significant margin given its challenges.\u201dThe department says it will award \u201capproximately $360 million in additional funds through the new Shelter and Services Grant Program\u201d later this fiscal year.Mayor Adams called the development \u201cwoefully insufficient,\u201d according to a statement from spokesperson Levy.\u201cToday we were notified that New York City will receive only $30 million in federal FEMA funding out of the $350 million in total funds we initially applied for, despite already spending more than $1 billion to shelter asylum seekers,\u201d the statement said.\u201cLet us be very clear: This is both disappointing and woefully insufficient for a city that has carried the cost of sheltering, feeding, and supporting more than 60,000 asylum seekers in the last year. New Yorkers have stepped up tremendously throughout this crisis and we look forward to working closely with our congressional delegation to remedy this serious mistake.\u201dCNN\u2019s Artemis Moshtaghian and Polo Sandoval contributed to this report."

        "text": "Emily Bhatnagar has always found solace in reading. When she\u2019s struggling with anxiety and depression, she turns to books.So when she accidentally saw a text message on her father\u2019s phone notifying relatives he had stage 4 thyroid cancer, she masked her fears with the one thing she\u2019s always found comfort in.But this time, she went a little further.At the age of 17, Emily launched a neighborhood book drive in honor of her dad, Mike Bhatnagar. She decided she\u2019d donate the books to children who were also facing health scares.\u201cI thought to myself, I\u2019m only a teenager. What can I do? I am not a doctor. I can\u2019t save lives, but I can hopefully make them a tiny bit brighter,\u201d says the teen, who lives with her parents in Gaithersburg, Maryland. \u201cI was drowning in sadness when my dad was diagnosed. Thinking of these little children going through the same thing as my dad was unimaginable.\u201dThis was July 2021. Her initial goal was to collect books for children undergoing cancer treatment, but she\u2019s expanded it to all patients under 18. She called her effort, after a favorite flower, and launched it with a request for book donations on neighborhood app Nextdoor.Nearly two years later, her father\u2019s thyroid has improved, For Love and Buttercup is a nonprofit and her grassroots efforts have spurred donations of more than 15,000 children\u2019s books to DC-area hospitals.\u201cButtercup flowers represent childlike innocence and playfulness that a lot of these kids don\u2019t get to experience \u2026 It\u2019s what I hope they feel, even for a few seconds, when they open my books,\u201d she says.The neighborhood book drive that began with a lone teen in a cloud of despair over her dad\u2019s illness has grown into a nationwide initiative. And Emily, now 19, says it\u2019s given her and her father a shared distraction that allows them to heal together.Emily Bhatnagar says she\u2019ll never forget the day she learned of her dad\u2019s cancer diagnosis in late 2019. He\u2019d asked her to help him find an email on his phone when she stumbled on the message.The teen says she had long battled depression, anxiety and an eating disorder, but that went up \u201c1,000%\u201d after she learned of her dad\u2019s illness.A few months later her dad was rushed to the ER because the tumor was making it hard for him to breathe and he needed an emergency tracheotomy.For months, Emily watched in fear as the disease began taking away pieces of him: his health, his hair, his voice. She started starving herself. She felt guilty about eating when her father was feeding through a tube.\u201cI just physically couldn\u2019t get myself to eat anything,\u201d she says. \u201cI wanted to spend every waking second with him.\u201dSo Emily, who says she largely kept to herself in school and read books during recess, started thinking about how to help.She posted the request for books on Nextdoor and was stunned when new and gently used volumes poured in from strangers of all backgrounds: a bioengineering graduate, a former sports journalist, a preschool teacher, a lover of romance novels, an astronomy major.Her parents grew up in New Delhi, India,and immigrated to the US three decades ago seeking a better life. The family runs a takeout restaurant that serves Indian food and bakes Roti, Paratha and other flatbreads. Emily set up anand listed their eatery\u2019s Gaithersburg address as the place where donors could send books.Her book drive became a family operation. The family, including Emily\u2019s older brother, Michael, began spending evenings at the eatery, opening boxes of books. Delivering boxes of books to hospitals became a father-daughter routine. On days when her father was too sick to go with her, Emily called him on FaceTime from the hospitals as she made deliveries.It gave the family something else to focus on during a stressful time.\u201cMy dad is always at the shop,\u201d Emily says. \u201cWhat I really like is that he never lost his spark after cancer. He\u2019s still super excited about life.\u201dMike Bhatnagar has lost most of his vocal cords and speaks in a raspy whisper. He uses a tube to feed through his stomach.He told CNN in an email that his daughter\u2019s project has given him strength \u2013 and her a voice.\u201cI feel a little bit more strong each day. Emily has a lot to do with that,\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t expect the impact of her book drive to be this huge. I thought it was only local and didn\u2019t realize just how much passion Emily had for this cause.\u201dAs Emily tried to come to terms with her dad\u2019s illness, she reached out to hospitals in the Washington, DC area about donating books. She wanted to give sick children a form of escape, too.One of her first donations was a batch of about 1,500 books to Inova Cares Clinic for Families, which treats underserved and uninsured people in northern Virginia, says Fadi Saadeh, the facility\u2019s senior director of community health.Emily says she tries to pick books for children of all ages \u2013 from infants to teenagers \u2013 and weighs several factors in her choices.\u201cOf course I want to include childhood classics like Harry Potter, but I also want to ensure my books are diverse and have characters that the children reading these books can see themselves in,\u201d she says.\u201cAs an Asian American, I always felt so excluded because almost none of the books I read had characters that looked like me, or could relate to my heritage. I also try to add books written by smaller authors that may be people of color, and books that carry powerful messages about perseverance.\u201dBetween the pages, she often tucks a personal note with a positive message for kids. Sometimes, she\u2019ll add Beanie Babies and other stuffed animals. Saadeh says those are extremely popular with kids at their Virginia clinics.\u201cDear sweet child,\u201d reads one of her notes to a pediatric cancer patient. \u201cYou are a real life superhero. My hero Superman\u2019s strength doesn\u2019t even compare to yours.\u201dThe Bhatnagar family delivered another 1,500 books in November to Holy Cross Health hospitals and clinics. Alisa Smallwood, chief development officer at Holy Cross Health, said the books are a welcome distraction for hospitalized kids.\u201cWhen we are faced with challenges, we really have a choice in how to respond. She chose to look outside herself and help others \u2013 that\u2019s really brave,\u201d Smallwood says. \u201cWe are grateful to have been chosen by Emily \u2026 Hospitals are a scary place for kids, and the books will help enhance the healing environment.\u201dWhenever possible, Emily specifies the books go to hospitals with pediatric cancer units. And as the pandemic eases, she has finally been able to distribute some books in person.\u201cWatching the kids get excited when I handed them the books \u2026 it was the most precious, best day of life,\u201d she says.Emily says she\u2019s still blown away by the fact that strangers donate books to her.\u201cThis would not even exist without them. It\u2019s still so crazy to me that they use their hard-earned money on my books \u2026 on a cause run by a 19-year-old.\u201dEmily says she is feeling much better now. But her father recently got some more bad news. His cancer was in remission for a while, but doctors recently found cancerous spots in his lungs, she says.This time, however, she feels a more equipped to handle the setback.\u201cYour emotions, no matter how strong and powerful they feel, they can never kill you,\u201d she says. \u201cYou will survive. You just have to breathe.\u201dEmily is taking virtual classes atand hopes to transfer to an in-person school once her father\u2019s health stabliizes.  Her dream is to major in psychology at Yale University and work with children.In the meantime, the books keep coming. Her not-so-little book drive is teaching her how to run a nonprofit and build relationships with community leaders.The most important lesson she\u2019s learned? That there\u2019s still beauty in the world, however tough things get sometimes, she says.And a book is always a good distraction."

Police said an Allen officer killed the shooter.Video from above the scene showed hundreds of shoppers exiting the area, many holding their hands up. The aerial footage appeared to show at least three bodies covered by sheets outside the mall.Allen Police Chief Brian Harvey described how the shooter was killed. \u201cOne of our officers was on an unrelated call at the outlet mall,\u201d said Harvey. \u201cHe heard gunshots, went to the gunshots, engaged the suspect, and neutralized the suspect.\u201dWitnesses told CNN that they saw the gunman who was dressed all in black, and was wearing tactical gear.In a photo obtained by CNN, the body of what appears to be the gunman is seen on the ground outside a restaurant location at the mall. The gunman, with an AR-15 style weapon nearby, appears to be wearing body armor with several extra magazines attached to chest gear.Police believe they have identified the vehicle of the deceased suspect, which was being examined by the bomb squad as a precaution, the source says.The mass shooting in Allen is the latest in a relentless series of gun violence across the nation that has brought terror to supermarkets, schools, hospitals and other places typically considered safe.

The nonprofit and CNN define mass shootings as those in which four or more people are shot, excluding the shooter.The massacre in Allen is the second-deadliest so far this year, behind the January mass shooting in Monterey Park, California,.Among the eight killed in Allen was Aishwarya Thatikonda, who was visiting the mall with a friend,reported.Thatikonda was an engineer who lived in nearby McKinney, but her family is mourning her loss from their home in India, a family representative told WFAA. The family plans to have her body sent to India, the representative said. CNN has reached out to the consulate general of India in Houston for more information.Christian LaCour, a 20-year-old mall security guard, was also killed in the massacre.

The Dallas Morning News reported the suspect had been staying in an extended stay hotel in Dallas.Garcia had worked for at least three security companies and had undergone hours of firearms proficiency training in recent years, according to a database maintained by the Texas Department of Public Safety.None of the companies immediately responded to requests for comment.The gunman was approved to work as a security guard in Texas from April 2016 until April 2020, when his license expired, according to his profile in the Texas Online Private Security database.As part of his work, Garcia received Level II and Level III security training. The former covers security laws in Texas; the latter, which is required for all commissioned security officers and personal protection officers in Texas, includes firearm training and the demonstration of firearm proficiency, according to Jonah Nathan, vice president of Ranger Guard, a security guard service in Texas not affiliated with Garcia\u2019s employers.Garcia completed a separate firearms proficiency training course in 2018 which requires six hours of continuing education, according to the database.Private security guards in Texas undergo background checks and are disqualified if they have committed certain crimes such as assault, burglary or sexual offenses, among others, according to the Texas Department of Public Safety website and state codes.They are also disqualified if they have been dishonorably discharged from the US military; have been found incompetent by a court of law; or have been required to register as a sex offender.  It\u2019s unclear why Garcia\u2019s license expired.Witness accounts, videos and photos obtained by CNN paint a vivid picture of the fear and devastation the gunman caused before he was killed by an officer who police say was already on the scene when the shooting happened.Garcia began firing in the parking lot near the mall\u2019s H&M store after he got out of his car, according to video obtained by CNN.Another witness video shows shoppers \u2013 some with small children \u2013 screaming, running and ducking behind rows of cars as the shots ring out.Gun violence has affected most families in the US, new survey findsSteven Spainhouer rushed to the scene after receiving a call from his son, who works at the H&M and had taken shelter in a break room. When he arrived in the parking lot outside the store, he \u201cstarted counting the bodies on the ground \u2026 one, two, three, five, six, seven bodies.\u201d\u201cThe first girl I walked up to \u2026 I felt for a pulse, pulled her head to the side, and she had no face,\u201d Spainhouer told CNN on Sunday.\u201cI saw moms and dads covering the eyes of their kids in tears, kids holding their hands up, people running for their lives,\u201d he said.He found a surviving child whose mother had been struck and killed as she shielded him from bullets, Spainhouer told.\u201cWhen I rolled the mother over, he came out,\u201d Spainhouer told the affiliate. \u201cHe was covered from head to toe, like somebody had poured blood on him.\u201dAs the gunman entered and made his way through the mall, shoppers yelled warnings to each other and fled as many store employees rushed to shelter customers in storage rooms or back hallways, according to several witness accounts.A weekend of tragedy in Texas spotlights two distinctly American political fissuresWeiss, the 18-year-old store employee, described hiding with coworkers and customers in a pair of rooms at the back of the store as \u201cthe most terrifying moment of my life.\u201d\u201cI immediately reached out to both of my parents, told them I was OK,\u201d Weiss said. \u201cBut I had other things to take care of.

This camp, she said, can be \u201ca lot of drama,\u201d with flares of violence.

But the prospect worries advocates for the unhoused, who say it simply pushes a critical problem out of public view, especially asandhave pushed households to the brink.As Phoenix officials prepare to start moving tents out of the Zone this week, they\u2019re also scrambling to create safe options for the displaced: leasing more hotel rooms and vacant buildings to convert into shelters, and building an outdoor campground with security, restrooms and hand-washing stations, the city\u2019s Office of Homeless Solutions director told CNN.But those won\u2019t be available right away.So for now, the crew of helpers has stepped up its years-old effort to try to get residents off the streets.\u201cWe have to move fast,\u201d team leader Nette Reed said. \u201cWe have to come up with a plan.\u201dDebbie and Joe Faillace have owned, next to where the camp cropped up, for more than 30 years.

Katie Hobbs this yearone, saying it only served to make homelessness \u201cless visible.\u201dThe Faillaces and others already had sued last year in state court over the Zone, an unofficial nickname that isn\u2019t universally embraced. They claimed the city had allowed its public spaces to violate its own public nuisance laws, with unsanitary conditions, drug use, violence and property crimes, fire hazards and blocked rights of way, court documents show.A judge in March ruled in their favor, giving the city a few months to eliminate the nuisance conditions, records show.Pitching a tent on public land is now a felony in TennesseeThe legal strategy may offer a template to anyone who lives or works near large homeless encampments, said Ilan Wurman, a lawyer for the Phoenix plaintiffs and an associate law professor at Arizona State University.\u201cWe basically showed a proof of concept to use the courts to force cities\u2019 hands to actually do something about the humanitarian aspect of this crisis,\u201d Wurman said. \u201cWe hope other businesses, property owners and homeowners take up this fight in other jurisdictions where there are massive homeless encampments.\u201dBut using such a lawsuit to clear an encampment like the Zone is an oversimplified tactic that not only\u2013 but also increases \u201cinvisible homelessness,\u201d National Alliance to End Homelessness CEO Ann Oliva said.\u201cOf course we\u2019re worried that this is going to be picked up as a tactic by other communities,\u201d she said. \u201cI hope that it\u2019s not a template for how other communities want to address this issue because we know that the only way to actually address this issue and homelessness is affordable housing and the services that people want and need in order to get housing.\u201dThe Phoenix area has roughly half as many shelter beds as people experiencing homelessness, a population that\u2019s grown 46% since 2019 amid the affordable housing crisis and the Covid-19 pandemic, according tocoordinated by the.Many who live in the Zone have jobs or get government assistance \u2013 but say they still can\u2019t afford rent. By setting up camp outside the non-profit Human Services Campus, they guaranteed quick access to a secure center with roughly 900 shelter beds \u2013 full on most nights \u2013 plus aid including food, water and health care, all critical during Arizona\u2019s.As the Zoneis cleared, \u201cthe farther people get removed, \u2026 the harder it will be for them to access services,\u201dCEO Amy Schwabenlender said.\u201cPeople will be more likely to die,\u201d she said, \u201cor be sick and go to the emergency room.\u201d More than 700 people experiencing homelessness died last year in Phoenix\u2019s Maricopa County \u2013 a 23% increase over 2020 that reflects the bump in unhoused people over that period, county officials confirmed to CNN.The Zone clearing, due to start Wednesday, will be piecemeal and dovetail with city efforts to come up with alternatives for its residents, said Rachel Milne, director of Phoenix\u2019s Office of Homeless Solutions.How one Minnesota county has been rapidly housing the homeless\u201cThe city\u2019s approach will be to take it one step at a time, one block at a time, one group of people at a time, making sure that we are able to offer those 50 or so people in that block a variety of different solutions, a variety of different places to go, all of which have the services that they will need to keep them safe and healthy,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s safer certainly than where they are now.\u201dBut without a confirmed opening date for the city-structured campground, advocates for unhoused people expect encampments like the Zone to pop up in other Phoenix neighborhoods, they said.\u201cIt moves people into other spaces where they\u2019re most likely also not going to be welcomed in,\u201d Schwabenlender said. \u201cAnd if they think a safe outdoor space is going to end homelessness, it\u2019s not. It just shuffles people from one place to another.\u201dIndeed, many seein Phoenix as a Band-Aid on the larger crisis facing cities across the country. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to work on other solutions: preventing more inflow, preventing people from experiencing homelessness, helping them exit the system quickly so that those shelter beds that we do have can be used more efficiently,\u201d Milne said.\u201cI think we have a lot of work to do.\u201dStefanie Powell doesn\u2019t know where she\u2019ll go when cleanup begins at the Zone, where she lives in a tent with her boyfriend, she said.\u201cI don\u2019t want to wind up having to walk the streets again,\u201d Powell said about finding a new place to stay. She can\u2019t work, she added, because of medical issues like neuropathy and fibromyalgia.\u201cIt\u2019s hard because nobody wants to see the problem. Nobody wants to acknowledge the problem,\u201d she said.\u201cThey just want it to go away.\u201d"

        "text": "The United States is bracing for the expiration of a pandemic-era border restriction this week, with officials fearing it willand exacerbate an already challenginghumanitarian crisis at the southern border.\u201cNo matter how much we are prepared, I don\u2019t think we are going to be prepared enough,\u201d John Martin, deputy director of thein El Paso, Texas, told CNN on Sunday, days before the lifting of Title 42, a Trump-erapolicy that allowed the government to quickly turn away certain migrants at the border, originally with the aim of stopping the spread of Covid-19.\u201cI wanted to emphasize more so than anything else at this point \u2013 this is a national issue,\u201d Martin said. \u201cWe in El Paso, along with many other communities along the southern border, just happened to be at the front doorstep.\u201dWhile first implemented under the Trump administration as a response to the pandemic, Title 42 has been kept in place by the courts and used by the Biden administration.That will change Thursday, when the public health emergency \u2013 and Title 42 along with it \u2013 is set to lapse amid unprecedented mass migration in the Western Hemisphere.\u201cThis is an international issue,\u201d Father Rafael Garcia, a priest who runs a shelter at an El Paso church whose surrounding streets have become a camp for hundreds of migrants. \u201cAnd we\u2019re just like the neck of the bottle, or funnel.\u201dWhy the US expects a border surge and is deploying troopsUS Customs and Border Protection officials already have seen an uptick in migrants at the border with Mexico in anticipation of the expiration of Title 42,as of late last month \u2013 a number that was expected to rise.\u201cI think that there is no question that this is going to be extremely challenging,\u201d Department of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said Friday in Brownsville, Texas, during a visit to the Rio Grande Valley. \u201cI do not want to understate the severity of the challenge that we expect to encounter.\u201dBut federal officials have long been preparing for the end of Title 42, Mayorkas stressed, saying the  government was ready.\u201cWe have a plan. We are executing on that plan.\u201dStill, in a news conference Monday morning, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott likened the expiration of Title 42 as the laying out of a welcome mat to migrants across the world, signaling to them America\u2019s borders are wide open.\u201cIt will lead to an incredible amount of people coming across the border illegally,\u201d Abbott said, adding the administration\u2019s policies would \u201ccause a catastrophic disaster.\u201dSome communities are already dealing with an influx of migrants.began seeing a spike about a week and a half ago, according to Sergio Cordova, a founder of the non-profit organization Team Brownsville.The organization has been receiving about 1,000 migrants a day at its center, Cordova said. And while many quickly move on to their next destinations, dozens have slept on the streets over the last week.Brownsville is also where a driver plowed into a group of people Sunday outside a shelter housing migrants, killing eight, including several immigrants. It was unclear whether the crash was intentional.More than 100 migrants found aboard train near US-Mexico border, days before Covid-era border policy expiresEl Paso, which declared a state of emergency ahead of Title 42\u2019s expiration, has about 2,300 migrants living on the streets around two shelters downtown, officials said last Thursday, describing the population as one of mixed legal status, with some who turned themselves in to US immigration authorities and others who crossed the border illegally.That\u2019s in addition to an estimated 330 migrants staying inside the shelters.A survey of 258 migrants by one shelter determined about 41% were processed by US immigration authorities, while 59% had illegally entered the country, according to Martin, who told CNN there were some 950 people camped outside in his center\u2019s alley.\u201cWe\u2019re still able to feed them but in all honesty, that\u2019s not sustainable operation at this point,\u201d he said, adding the center has moved to serving two meals instead of three, something only possible with the American Red Cross and a local food bank,.More could be on the way: El Paso Mayor Oscar Leeser estimated up to 15,000 migrants are in or traveling to Ciudad Juarez, on Mexico\u2019s side of the border, waiting for Title 42 to lift.\u201cWe are a border city. We do have requirements and we do have responsibilities that we have to do, but these people aren\u2019t coming to El Paso, we all know that,\u201d Leeser said last month, after signing the emergency declaration. \u201cThey\u2019re coming to the United States.\u201dTijuana, across the border from nearby San Diego, has about 6,000 migrants waiting in shelters and homes across the city, according to Enrique Lucero, the city\u2019s director of migrant affairs.A growing number of migrants are jumping the border fence and swimming across the border, Lucero said. But the shelters\u2019 numbers don\u2019t drop because more migrants arrive each day, and some are of nationalities he\u2019s never never seen there before, hailing from places like Kazakhstan, Mauritania, Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan.\u201cWe are at the brink of a humanitarian crisis,\u201d Lucero said, adding shelters are already beyond capacity.The impact of Title 42\u2019s expiration could be felt far beyond the border \u2013 particularly in cities that have in recent months become the targets for Republican governors and officials in Southern states sending buses of migrants elsewhere.That\u2019s become a full-blown crisis for New York City. About 58,300 asylum seekers have arrived and been processed through the city\u2019s shelter system over nearly a year, with more than 36,100 currently in the city\u2019s care as of the end of April,.Mayor Eric Adams has been vocal in his calls for more aid, saying the migrant arrivals in his city and others in the Northeast should be handled by the federal government. The financial burden, he said recently, is also taking a toll on the city, which on Friday was awarded $30.5 million from the Federal Emergency Management Agency in humanitarian aid \u2013 a fraction of the $350 million the city asked for.New York City mayor announces plan to transport willing migrants to locations outside the city ahead of expected surgeA joint statement from City Council Speaker Adrienne Adams and Finance Chair Justin Brannan called it \u201cpaltry.\u201dOn Friday,the city would send willing migrants to neighboring New York communities, providing up to four months of shelter to single men seeking asylum already in the city\u2019s care.That plan was not well-received by officials from Rockland County, which would host some of those migrants. The county, about 25 miles north of New York\u2019s northern boundary, declared a state of emergency Saturday saying it \u201cis not capable of receiving and sustaining\u201d the migrants New York wants to send there.The state of emergency prohibits other municipalities from sending migrants, Rockland County Executive Ed Day said in a statement.lists New York City\u2019s other possible \u201csolutions\u201d for a surge, including tents in Central Park, a retrofitted airplane hangar at John F. Kennedy International Airport and building temporary tiny homes. The memo notes the city is anticipating 800 migrants will arrive in the city each day after Title 42 lifts.Three officials in Adams\u2019 administration confirmed the authenticity of the planning document to CNN.Fabien Levy, Adams\u2019 spokesperson, declined to comment on the specific proposals outlined in the document but told CNN, \u201cWhile we do not discuss internal deliberations, we\u2019ve been clear that the burden of caring for asylum seekers shouldn\u2019t fall on any one city alone.\u201dThe Biden administration has worked to discourage migrants from simply crossing the border, stressing the legal pathways for their entry to the US.That includes regional processing centers the administration said last monthin Colombia and Guatemala, which are frequently transited by migrants on their way to the US-Mexico border. The government has pledged to increase the number of refugees allowed into the US and is pushing applicants to use those regional centers.\u201cThe idea is, of course, that people will not continue their journey over land,\u201d a senior administration official. \u201cThe whole idea of regional processing centers is to give people a lawful, safe, regular way to enter the United States.\u201dWhen Title 42 lifts, US officials will, under which migrants will face more severe consequences for crossing the border unlawfully, such as being barred from entering the US for at least five years. Asylum seekers who cross the border without first applying for asylum will be removed under that Title 8 authority.Under this approach, if they attempt to cross again, they can face criminal prosecution, and the DHS promised these migrants will be removed from the US will be removed quickly and efficiently.\u201cIndividuals who access the lawful pathways that we deliver for them will be able to come to the United States in a safe and orderly way,\u201d Mayorkas said during a news conference in Brownsville, urging migrants not to listen to smugglers who he said were providing them misinformation, leading them to believe they could come to the US.Those who arrive \u201cirregularly,\u201d he said, \u201cwill be presumed, absence some limited exceptions, to be ineligible for asylum.\u201dBorder detention facilities reach capacity amid spike in migrantsIn the meantime, the government is \u201csurging resources\u201d to \u201ceffect a greater number of removals every week,\u201d Mayorkas said, also touting Border Patrol processing facilities like the one he visited in Brownsville, which he said had been set up within 72 hours.The Biden administration has also deployed to the border 1,500 active-duty troops, who will join approximately 2,500 National Guard members, for 90 days,. They will serve not in a law enforcement capacity, the sources said, but in administrative roles to free up DHS resources so US Customs and Border Protection can operate more freely in the field.\u201cFundamentally we are working within a broken immigration system that for decades has been in dire need of reform,\u201d Mayorkas said. \u201cThat is a fact about which everyone agrees, and we urge Congress to fix our broken immigration system.\u201dAbbott on Monday said his state was deploying a new National Guard unit to \u201chot spots along the border to intercept, to repel and to turn back migrants who are trying to enter Texas illegally.\u201d Additionally, Abbott hoped the Legislature would pass laws later this month to give Teas more \u201ctools\u201d to secure the border, including making it a felony to illegally enter the state from Mexico.CNN\u2019s Rosa Flores, Priscilla Alvarez, Gloria Pazmino, Samantha Beech, Natasha Bertrand and Haley Britzky contributed to this report."

        "text": "Editor\u2019s Note:This story contains graphic descriptions of the crash\u2019s aftermath.Police say they are charging the man witnesses say drove a vehicle into a shelter in Brownsville, Texas, on Sunday and attempted to flee with eight counts of manslaughter and 10 counts of assault with a deadly weapon, the city\u2019s police chief, Felix Sauceda said.The man who drove a vehicle into a group of people near a shelter in Brownsville, Texas, on Sunday, killing eight, is expected to face further charges Monday.Brownsville police spokesperson Martin Sandoval said police will announce preliminary charges for the driver at a news conference at 10:30 a.m. CT.Several immigrants were among those killed when a Land Rover hit a group waiting at a bus stop across the street from the, a non-profit homeless shelter helping to house migrants in the border town, authorities say.Police say they are still investigating the violent crash, which was captured on surveillance video. The footage shows the vehicle driving at a very high rate of speed and hitting a curb about 30 feet from where the migrants were sitting before the driver appears to lose control, Maldonado told CNN on Sunday.Death toll increases to 8 after car plows into a crowd in front of a Texas shelter that was housing migrantsThere were about 20 to 25 migrants sitting on the curb at around 8:30 a.m. when police reported receiving reports of the crash, according to the shelter\u2019s director. The migrants were from Venezuela and had arrived at the shelter just days ago, Maldonado said.The driver \u2013 identified only as a Hispanic man \u2013 received medical care and was arrested on suspicion of reckless driving, Sandoval said. He added additional charges are likely.The fatal crash comes as border towns like Brownsville are bracing for a migrant surge when theon Thursday. US Customs and Border Protection officials already have seen an uptick in migrants at the border with Mexico in anticipation of the expiration of Title 42.. At the time, the center\u2019s director said migrants from all over the world were starting to stay at his shelter and he was seeing an uptick in stays.Located on the southern tip of Texas, Brownsville\u2019s population is nearly 95% Hispanic or Latino, according to the 2022 census.The city recently declared a state of emergency after receiving an influx of thousands of migrants, many from Venezuela, in the past several weeks,After the crash, witnesses at the scene detained the driver until officers arrived, Sandoval said. Exclusive video obtained by CNN shows a group of people trying to restrain the man after the crash.Cesar Romero, 34, is a Venezuelan national who said he witnessed the crash and saw his friends run over by the vehicle.\u201cSome of the men killed had just arrived the night before,\u201d he said while tears rolled down his face.Romero said after the crash, the driver exited his vehicle and appeared to be impaired. He said the driver tried to run away and yelled obscenities, but witnesses stopped him.The man in the video is the driver of the vehicle, Sandoval told CNN. He has not been named by police. Investigators were made aware of the video Monday morning.\u201cThe video is part of a separate incident investigation but related to the accident,\u201d Sandoval said. \u201cWe are looking at what the DA can formulate from the video to see if they have enough to potentially face charges.\u201d\u201cWe are looking at it three different ways,\u201d Sandoval said. \u201cOne, to see if he was intoxicated. We took a blood sample, and we have to turn it over to the Texas DPS crime lab. Two, we have to look at it as a malfunction of the car. Or three it could be intentional. All of these are possibilities.\u201dThe driver has been uncooperative and has been giving authorities different names, Sandoval said. Investigators must fingerprint the driver to get his identifying details \u2013 which takes longer, he added.A blood sample was also taken from the driver and a toxicology test will be ordered, according to Sandoval, and it\u2019s unclear how long the results will take.At the scene of the fatal crash Sunday, investigators were examining the mangled Range Rover, which could be seen with its windshield shattered and its driver-side door and hood damaged.As the death toll from therose to eight, witnesses described the horrifying moment the driver plowed into the group.The shelter director and a staff member ran out to the street to find a very graphic scene, with body parts spread across the area, Maldonado told CNN.\u201cI\u2019ve got a staff (member) who is in shock,\u201d Maldonado said, adding he, too, was in shock.Another witness described the vehicle overturning as it hit the crowd.\u201cI could hear the car hitting people and the thumping and I saw how the SUV rolled over when he hit them,\u201d witness Jose Del Transito Rubio Armijo toldin Spanish.Witnesses have also described seeing the driver ignore a red light before driving up on a curb and running over people at the bus stop, according to Sandoval.The FBI is assisting local police with the investigation and Border Patrol is working to confirm the identities of the victims, authorities said.Police are set to provide more information about the crash during a Monday morning news conference.Community members marked a solemn Sunday mass at the Ozanam Center Sunday evening, just hours after the deadly crash across the street.\u201cAs we await a fuller report from law enforcement authorities, let us stop for a moment to mourn these losses of life and to pray. Pray for the victims, pray for the families and loved ones, and pray for our community,\u201d Bishop Daniel Flores of the Catholic Diocese of Brownsville said in a statement.\u201cWe must resist the corrosive tendency to devalue the lives of immigrants, the poor, and the vulnerable. Let us take extra steps as a local community to care for and protect one another, especially the most vulnerable,\u201d Flores said.CNN\u2019s Zoe Sottile and Gloria Pazmino contributed to this report."

        "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-65322706",
        "text": "India's population has reached 1,425,775,850 people, surpassing the number of people in mainland China, according to the UN's estimates.India's decennial census - scheduled to be held in 2021 - has been delayed, so there's no official population data. China's most recent - and seventh census - was conducted in 2020.To estimate and project populations of both India and China, the UN relies on information about levels and trends in fertility, mortality and migration acquired from records, surveys and administrative data.What is clear is that both India and China have more than 1.4 billion people each, and for over 70 years have accounted for more than a third of the global population.China's population is likely to begin shrinking next year. Last year, 10.6 million people were born, a little more than the number of deaths, thanks to a rapid drop in fertility rate. According to the UN, the Chinese population will continue to fall and could drop to below a billion before the end of the century.India's fertility rate has also fallen substantially in recent decades - from 5.7 births per woman in 1950 to two births per woman today - but the rate of decline has been slower. India's population is virtually certain to continue to grow for several decades - the UN expects the population to peak around 2064, and then decline gradually.So what does India overtaking China as the most populous country in the world mean?China reduced its population growth rate by about half from 2% in 1973 to 1.1% in 1983.Demographers say much of this was achieved by riding roughshod over human rights - two separate campaigns promoting just one child and then later marriages, longer gaps between children and fewer of them - in what was a predominantly rural and overwhelmingly uneducated and poor country.Investments in public health and increased education for women and their participation in the workforce, among other things, also contributed to the decline in fertility.India's population more than trebled in the six decades after independence - from 361 million people in 1951 to more than 1.2 billion in 2011.India saw rapid population growth - almost 2% annually - for much of the second half of the last century. Over time, death rates fell, life expectancy rose and incomes went up. More people - especially those living in cities - accessed clean drinking water and modern sewerage. \"Yet the birth rate remained high,\" says Tim Dyson, a demographer at the London School of Economics.India launched a family planning programme in 1952 and laid out a national population policy for the first time only in 1976, about the time China was busy reducing its birth rate.Butof millions of poor people in an overzealous family planning programme during the 1975 Emergency - when civil liberties were suspended - led to a social backlash against family planning. \"Fertility decline would have been faster for India if the Emergency hadn't happened and if politicians had been more proactive. It also meant that all subsequent governments treaded cautiously when it came to family planning,\" Prof Dyson says.East Asian countries such as South Korea, Malaysia, Taiwan and Thailand, which launched population programmes much later than India, achieved lower fertility levels, cut infant and maternal mortality rates, raised incomes and improved human development earlier than India.India has added more than a billion people since independence in 1947, and its population is expected to grow for another 40 years.But its population growth rate has been declining for decades now, and the country has defied dire predictions about a \"demographic disaster\".So India having more people than China is no longer significant in a \"concerning\" way, say demographers.Rising incomes and improved access to health and education have helped Indian women have fewer children than before, effectively flattening the growth curve.Fertility rates have dipped below replacement levels - two births per woman - in 17 out of 22 states and federally administered territories. (A replacement level is one at which new births are sufficient to maintain a steady population.)According to Pew Research Center, all religious groups in India have shown, based on data available in India's decennial census and the National Family Health Survey (NFHS).As a result there have been only \"modest changes\" in the religious make-up of the people since 1951.Fertility rates among all religious groups have declined, according to official data.The decline in birth rates has beenthan in the more populous north. \"It is a pity that more of India could not have been like south India,\" says Prof Dyson. \"All things being equal, rapid population growth in parts of north India have depressed living standards\".It could, for example, strengthen India's claim to a permanent seat in the, which has five permanent members, including China.India is a founding member of the UN and has always insisted that its claim to a permanent seat is just. \"I think you have certain claims on things [by being the country with largest population],\" says John Wilmoth, director of the Population Division of the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs.The way India's demography is changing is also significant, according to KS James, director of the Mumbai-based International Institute for Population Sciences.Despite drawbacks, India deserves some credit for managing a \"healthy demographic transition\", by using family planning in a democracy which was both poor and largely uneducated, says Prof James. \"Most countries did this after they had achieved higher literacy and living standards.\"More good news: one in five people below 25 years in the world is from India and 47% of Indians are below the age of 25. Two-thirds of Indians were born after India liberalised its economy in the early 1990s.This group of young Indians have some unique characteristics, says Shruti Rajagopalan, an economist, in. \"This generation of young Indians will be the largest consumer and labour source in the knowledge and network goods economy. Indians will be the largest pool of global talent,\" she says.India needs to create enough jobs for its young working age population to reap a demographic dividend. Only 40% of India's working-age population works or wants to work, according to the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE).More women would need jobs as they spend less time in their working age giving birth and looking after children. The picture here is bleaker - only 10% of working-age women were participating in the labour force in October, according to CMIE, compared with 69% in China.Then there's migration. Some 200 million Indians have migrated within the country - between states and districts - and their numbers are bound to grow. Most are workers who leave villages for cities to find work.\"Our cities will grow as migration increases because of lack of jobs and low wages in villages. Can they provide migrants a reasonable living standard? Otherwise, we will end up with more slums and disease,\" says S Irudaya Rajan, a migration expert at Kerala's International Institute of Migration and Development.Demographers say India also needs to stop child marriages, prevent early marriages and properly register births and deaths. Aat birth - meaning more boys are born than girls - remains a worry.Political rhetoric about \"population control\" appears to be targeted at Muslims, the country's largest minority when, in reality, \"gaps in childbearing between India's religious groups are generally much smaller than they used to be\", according to aDemographers say the ageing of India receives little attention.In 1947, India's median age was 21. A paltry 5% of people were above the age of 60.Today, the median age is over 28, and more than 10% of Indians are over 60 years. Southern states such as Kerala and Tamil Nadu achieved replacement levels at least 20 years ago.In Kerala, for example, the rise in population between 2001 and 2011 was lowest (4.9%) among states. A newborn in the state can expect to live for 75 years, against the national average of 69. Smaller families here ensure that children are educated well. This leads to the young migrating quickly within and outside the country for opportunities, leaving their parents at home.The UN estimates that between 2023 and 2050, the number of people aged 65 and above is expected to nearly double in China, and to more than double in India, \"posing significant challenges to the capacity of healthcare and social insurance systems\".\"As the working-age population declines, supporting an older population will become a growing burden on the government's resources,\" says Rukmini S, author of Whole Numbers and Half Truths: What Data Can and Cannot Tell Us About Modern India.\"Family structures will have to be recast and elderly persons living alone will become an increasing source of concern,\" she says."

        "text": "Adidas has said the ending of its collaboration with Kanye West is \"hurting\" the business, with sales in North America hard hit.The sportswear giant cut its ties with the designer and rapper, known as Ye, late last year after he posted anti-Semitic comments on social media.West designed trainers under the Yeezy brand and Adidas said the loss of the business cut sales by \u20ac400m (\u00a3350m) in the first quarter of the year.Overall, total revenue fell by 1%.Despite the dip, the figures were better than analysts had been expecting and Adidas said that sales were up 9% when the impact of the Yeezy business was excluded.Adidas said it was benefiting from the current trend for \"terrace\" style trainers and was seeing \"extraordinary demand\" for its Samba, Gazelle and Campus brands.Terrace styles are those that were originally popular among football fans in the 1980s, when supporters first embraced designer fashion brands such as Fila and Sergio Tacchini.While Adidas said it had a limited supply of such shoes at the start of the year, it plans to increase production in the coming months.In its latest results, Adidas said sales in North America had fallen by 20% as the region was particularly affected by the ending of the Yeezy business.Adidas chief executive Bjorn Gulden said the loss of Yeezy is \"of course hurting us\".The company scrapped its tie-up with West in October last year following the rapper's anti-Semitic comments. At the time, the firm said: \"Adidas does not tolerate antisemitism and any other sort of hate speech.\"Adidas said that if it decided not to \"repurpose\" its remaining unsold Yeezy stock, this would hit its operating profit by \u20ac500m this year.The company still has to decide what to do with the remaining products, and whether it will sell them or scrap them.Mr Gulden the firm was narrowing its options on the Yeezy stock, and the company was getting \"closer and closer\" to a decision.Pippa Stephens, senior apparel analyst at GlobalData, said that while Adidas was \"unable to reverse its past mistakes, it must now quickly come to a decision on what to do with its remaining Yeezy stock, to avoid angering its investors even further\".\"Should it decide to sell it, it risks damaging its brand reputation even further, so must ensure it does so sensitively to avoid upsetting customers.\"The company is being sued by investors who claim Adidas knew about Kanye West's problematic behaviour years before it ended their partnership.Investors allege Adidas failed to limit financial losses and take precautionary measures to minimise their exposure.In response, Adidas said it rejected \"these unfounded claims\", adding that it would take \"all necessary measures to vigorously defend ourselves against them\".Despite the drop in overall sales during the first three months of the year, Adidas reported a higher-than-expected operating profit of \u20ac60m.Strong demand for its football, running and tennis shoes helped footwear revenues grow by 1%.However, Mr Gulden - who joined Adidas at the start of this year from rival Puma - warned that 2023 would be \"a bumpy year with disappointing numbers\".He also said that Adidas was aiming to make sure that 50% of the products it sells in China are designed specifically for the Chinese market.China is the world's second largest sportswear market, but Adidas has been falling behind its rivals there.In the first three months of the year, its sales in China were down 9.4% from a year earlier.Adidas sued by investors over Kanye West dealAdidas Kanye West's Yeezy shoes 'collectors' items'Adidas warns of losses from Kanye West fallout"

That had led a \"very small minority\" of staff to believe they could get away with harassment or violence against women, the group said.An earlier report by the law firm led to the dismissal of Ms Newton-Smith's predecessor, Tony Danker. He was the subject of separate complaints of workplace misconduct, for which he has apologised.The CBI said Ms Newton-Smith had spoken to more than 250 members and former members in an effort to shore up support.But some of its most high profile members have deserted the organisation, including John Lewis and BMW. Others such as Tesco and Sainsbury's have suspended their engagement.The government has also suspended any activity with the lobby group, with Chancellor Jeremy Hunt saying there was \"no point\" engaging with the CBI when its own members had deserted it.Government shuns lobby giant after rape claimBusiness group hired 'toxic' staff and failed to actNew CBI boss: I saw sexual harassment and actedBusiness group CBI is finished, says City bossJohn Lewis quits the CBI after second rape claim"

        "text": "A scheme in south London is trying a new approach to property ownership: flats that are only for sale to local people, at prices set according to what local people earn.\"My old landlord actually hugged me, she was so happy for me when I finally got my own place,\" says Alex Ingram.The 41-year-old civil servant is delighted with his new one-bedroom flat in Lewisham, in the recently completed Citizens House, a four-storey block of 11 homes.For the past 18 years Alex has either rented, lodged or lived in flat-shares in London.This flat cost him \u00a3215,000, about 35% cheaper than similar places nearby.That's because he didn't buy it on the open market. He bought it through a community land trust (CLT).About 500 locals developed his building with the help of Lewisham Council, the Greater London Authority (GLA) and London CLT, a non-profit that helps neighbourhoods set up and run CLTs.The locals decided issues like planning, design and, perhaps most importantly, sale prices.This is calculated by looking at average local income levels, which the flats will continue to track.Only people who can prove a strong connection to Lewisham for five years - through living or working there - can apply.Alex has lived in Lewisham for eight years. Also in his favour, he has been involved with a local charity called Wheels for Wellbeing, which helps disabled people get into cycling.Other qualifying criteria include being able to get a mortgage, having a child in a local school and showing a demonstrable housing need.The initiative aims to help people who are priced out of their local area but who aren't eligible to be on the council's housing priority list.An independent panel decides on the applications.Because the prices are fixed, these flats are unlikely to appeal as an investment or \"nest egg\".An \"asset lock\" means the flats can only be sold on the same terms on which they were bought.\"I didn't have another option,\" says Alex. \"The existing model of investing in a home doesn't work for me.\"But I think it's better that I have a home that has a stable value. I now have something to start from.\"The site for Citizens House was donated for free by Lewisham Council, one of the reasons the scheme is financially viable. The land had previously been occupied by a set of disused garages.It has taken a decade of community campaigning to get the building completed.However, London CLT believes it can speed up the process and is developing six other projects in the capital, in areas such as Greenwich, Shadwell and Lambeth.There are 350 legally incorporated CLTs in England and Wales, according to the, with 200 more forming. However, the vast majority of these trusts offer properties for rent rather than for sale.The open market leaves property prices open to speculation, and can result in foreign buyers investing in flats which then lie empty.But at least it is clear who has the right to purchase properties in this system - the person who bids the most money.What if CLT flats are oversubscribed and someone feels they were wrongly passed over?\"A robust, fair and transparent process for deciding what sort of homes will be created and who will live in them is vital,\" says Beth Boorman of CLT Network, \"and housing needs can differ from area to area.\"Each CLT draws up its own rules and some even use a lottery system to whittle down appropriate candidates.\"No system for buying houses is perfect,\" points out property expert Henry Pryor. He believes CLTs, which have cross-party political support, are part of the solution to the UK's housing shortage.There are some obstacles to them becoming a significant part of the housing mix though, he adds.They rely on finding redundant land that is not available for development.And, when residents move out, they will find that house prices in the open market have appreciated more than their homes, which may be an issue if they wish to buy elsewhere.Christian Codjoe, 30, is due to move into his flat in a few weeks.He currently lives with his parents. He had saved for a deposit but feared he would have to move to Croydon or Kent to buy a home.\"Interest rates are crazy right now, but even with high mortgage payments the CLT flats are 100% worth it and get me on the housing ladder,\" he says.Christian thinks his application was successful because he has lived in Lewisham his whole life, attends a local church and his current home is due to be demolished for a private development.Fellow resident Kes Gill-Martin, 35, has just moved into a one-bedroom flat with his partner, and agrees.\"Affordable housing is very scarce and finally owning a home is transformative for us.\"This place feels like a massive change in our personal world, but such a small change in terms of what society needs.\"What is happening to house prices?Shortfall of homes to rent creates frenzied market"

        "text": "Job creation in the US remained robust last month, despite turmoil in the banking sector and the impact of higher borrowing costs.Employers added 253,000 jobs, which was better than many analysts had expected.The unemployment rate fell to 3.4%, returning to a multi-decade low.The gains were a reminder of the resilience of the US labour market, which has held up in the face of aggressive efforts by the US central bank to cool the economy.The Federal Reserve has raised its benchmark interest rate from near zero to between 5% and 5.25% in little over a year, an abrupt shift aimed at curbing prices that were soaring last year at the fastest pace in decades.These increases have sharply increased the cost of buying a home or car, as well as making it more expensive to borrow to expand a business or take on other debt. In theory, that should reduce demand, leading the economy to slow and easing the pressures pushing up prices.But while job gains have moderated since last year, they continue to outpace the numbers that economists estimate are needed to keep up with population growth.In its Friday report, the Labor Department said hiring had been weaker than previously estimated in February and March.But last month, job creation picked up again, while wages were up 4.4% from a year ago.\"Today's report clearly suggests weakening labour markets - most obviously in the downward revisions of prior months data - but from a very strong starting point,\" said Ronald Temple, chief market strategist at Lazard.Many economists expect the US economy to fall into recession later this year, noting big slowdowns in key sectors such as housing.Recent weeks have seen a flurry of job cut announcements by big companies such as Facebook-owner Meta, Amazon, entertainment giant Disney, banks and other firms.The rate rises also contributed to turmoil in the banking sector, which has been rocked by the most serious string of failures since the 2008 financial crisis.But the head of the US central bank, Jerome Powell, said this week that the continuing strength of the labour market made him hopeful that this time would be \"different\" - and the US could avoid a downturn that would throw millions of people out of work.\"That would be against history,\" he acknowledged. \"I fully appreciate that.\"Software engineer Brian Zovko was laid off from his job in the car industry in February.He said he was surprised because his company had been posting strong profits. But more recently bosses had raised the prospect of cost cuts, noting that they were concerned about the impact of higher borrowing costs and a slowdown in the economy.The 27-year-old, who lives in Texas, says he has been relying on savings and trying to spend cautiously. He said he sensed that the market has cooled over the past few months - but he remained hopeful he would find a new job shortly.\"I'm mildly optimistic that I should be able to get back on track,\" he said. However, he added, \"it seems like there's a decent risk the economy gets worse\".US raises interest rates to highest in 16 yearsUS economic growth slows as firms cut investment"

But as you proceed to make the payment, there's a new option on the check-out menu: Would you like to add a tip?An unusual request, but it could soon become real.Employees at the first-ever unionised Apple Store in the US are proposing to provide customers with the option to tip for service.The proposal, first reported earlier this week by Bloomberg, has sparked debate about tipping culture in the United States and so-called \"tipping fatigue\".In a series of tweets, the union acknowledged the idea could be \"a little controversial\".\"Apple employees everywhere can tell you that they are already being offered tips by customers,\" thein suburban Baltimore said.As it stands, if an Apple employee accepts a tip, he or she could be fired. The new proposal would create a system that allows \"occasional\" customers to reward the team without fear of termination, according to the Union.Making customers feel \"guilt tipped\" when they decline to add a few extra dollars to a purchase, is part of a business model that's emerging around American tipping culture in the wake of the pandemic, say experts.\"It's tipping everything, everywhere, all at once,\" said Thomas Farley, an etiquette expert popularly known as 'Mister Manners'.The Towson, Maryland Apple Store became the first in the country to unionise in 2022.  Apple store employees, and its labour union, The Coalition of Organised Retail Employees (CORE) are currently engaged in contract negotiations with the tech giant and said they expect \"there will be compromises made\".The tipping scheme proposed would offer customers options ranging from \"no tip, 3%, 5%, custom amount\", the Union said.  Any funds collected through tips would be split among the team members.But on social media, backlash to the proposed tipping scheme was swift, with many noting that tips are generally offered to workers who make low hourly-wages.Consumers tipped an average 19.6% at full-service restaurants, according to a report from Toast, a point-of-sale service platform.Etiquette expert Mr Farley said technology is the primary driver behind this \"tipping invasion\". As more companies adopt digital payment systems, like Square and Toast, consumers are often being prompted to add a tip after completing a transaction.\"My fear is that we're rapidly advancing toward a culture where we're expected to tip for absolutely everything,\" he said.A survey offound more than half of Americans said they gave a tip \"when they normally wouldn't\" because they were prompted by the check-out system.Mr Farley said the rise in demand for tips has become commonplace, in part, because businesses have used the prospect of tips to entice workers in a tight labour market instead of offering higher wages.Generally, these workers make less than minimum wage and rely on tips to make a living, he said.\"These are instances where I would absolutely not be miserly, as long as your budget allows,\" he said, but in situation where you know the server is likely making above minimum wage, a tip is discretionary.\"Just because it's there on a screen doesn't mean you have to, although I know hitting 'no tip' makes you feel like Scrooge,\" he said.  \"That's the idea of a guilt tip.\"Apple store workers vote to form first US unionHow does the world tip?

        "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/business-65478826",
        "text": "HSBC has fought off an attempt by its biggest shareholder to break up the bank during a frequently tense annual general meeting.Chinese insurer Ping An has been trying for more than a year to split the bank.On Friday it failed to gain the backing of any other major shareholder as investors voted to reject the proposal.HSBC chairman Mark Tucker said the result \"draws a line\" under a long-running debate about the bank's structure.Despite being headquartered in London, the large majority of HSBC's profits are made in Asia.Ping An, which holds an 8% stake in HSBC, wants the lender to separate out its Asian business.It argues that the bank's profitable Asia operations are subsidising other parts of the bank that are not performing as strongly. Splitting HSBC would also set it free from the requirements of UK regulators.Ping An and Ken Lui, an individual Hong Kong-based shareholder in HSBC, needed to secure 75% of all votes cast at the AGM to force through the split.They failed to get those numbers, with no other major institutional investor backing the plan.Mr Tucker told the AGM a break-up of the bank would undermine its global strategy, and would be both risky and costly.\"It would not be in shareholders' interests to split the bank,\" he told the AGM in Birmingham, which was frequently interrupted by climate change activists who claim HSBC is not doing enough to reduce its financing of polluting industries and businesses.At the meeting, Mr Lui vowed to fight on with the break-up plan, saying he would keep pressure on HSBC's management and would lobby the bank's many small shareholders in Hong Kong.It is not clear what Ping An's next step will be but there are bigger factors at play beyond making a return on its investment.Ping An is partly owned by the Chinese state and, according to some analysts, could be representing Beijing's political aims as much as its shareholders' financial interests.Hong Kong is by far China's most important financial hub and HSBC is the centrepiece institution.Some argue that to Beijing, the idea of simply leaving the city's most valuable asset in Western hands could be a risk that is too big to take.The example of Russia's economic isolation following the invasion of Ukraine is a case in point.Should a similar geopolitical crisis emerge involving China - not an impossibility given the tensions around Taiwan and the South China Sea - having a grip on one of Asia's top banks will be vital.In this sense, HSBC is dealing with an existential crisis that dates back to its founding in Hong Kong under British rule.For most of its 158-year history, the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation - as it was originally known - has had a long-distance relationship with the UK.In fact, HSBC only became a major UK High Street player in the 1990s, when it bought Midland Bank and moved its headquarters to London in 1993. To this day, HSBC even prints the bank notes in Hong Kong.\"There is a jarring gap between HSBC's centre of gravity in Hong Kong and its subservience to regulators in Britain,\" says Steve Vickers, a corporate risk consultant based in Hong Kong. \"This is an accident of history and a remnant of the colonial era.\"A small taste of this came in 2020, when the Bank of England directed HSBC and other British lenders to stop paying out dividends to shareholders because of the pandemic.This enraged ordinary shareholders in Hong Kong, who own about a third of HSBC's shares and many of whom rely on the payments for their retirement funds.From the Chinese mainland perspective, it was a simple but stark illustration of the power of officials on the other side of the world. Asia may generate the money, but ultimately London calls the shots.This is not a situation either Ping An or China wants to be in. It may explain why Ping An is pushing HSBC so hard and so publicly with the kind of shareholder activism that is normally associated with Western investors.\"A more assertive China is now unafraid to project itself in the international business arena,\" says Steve Vickers. \"But they have to tread very carefully with HSBC - the stakes are high.\"Investors sue over Credit Suisse collapseHSBC \u00a31 deal to buy collapsed bank to boost profitBank on heightened alert for further banking risksHSBC swoops in to rescue UK arm of Silicon Valley Bank"

Ikea is offering a coronation chicken flavour sauce on its famous meatballs.Tesco's Maheen Piracha said shoppers were in a mood to celebrate: \"Judging by early sales, King Charles' Coronation is set to spark a feel-good factor with plenty of street and house parties.\"No street party would be complete without a tipple - Tesco anticipated it would sell 180,000 bottles of Pimms and Asda said beer sales were expected to be 25% higher for the three-day weekend.Sales of flags, bunting and paper plates have also sky rocketed - Asda said sales of Union Jack flags were up 227%, and Coronation cups were up 135%.Aside from food and drink, millions is being spent on Coronation souvenirs and memorabilia. Owners of King Charles spaniels - and other breeds too -  may be preparing to dress their pooch for the occasion, courtesy of Gateshead company Franky's Bowtique.Founder Kerry Whitney said she had been \"running around like a headless chicken\" over the past fortnight to complete more than a thousand orders for crowns, bandanas and bow ties.\"We're busy at Halloween and Christmas anyway and we didn't know how popular it would be because everyone loved the Queen so much, but it's just snowballed,\" she said.The CRR forecast \u00a3245.91m would be spent on Coronation coins, tokens and medallions, celebratory teapots, mugs, cups and other crockery.Asda said its Coronation cushion and King Charles teapot had proven popular and it had sold 3,000 of each respectively. John Lewis said sales of its Coronation spoon were strong.Halcyon Days holds a royal warrant and makes Coronation plates and souvenirs from its factories in Stoke on Trent and the Midlands.Chief executive Pamela Harper tolddemand had been \"absolutely extraordinary\" in the last few months.\"The whole royal memorabilia is still very much alive and kicking. We've got the gifting market and our international market in London driven by international tourists, particularly the Americans, coming in droves, coming to buy a piece to take home.\"The CRR said spending by additional foreign tourists could be as high as \u00a3323m with much of it spent on accommodation, restaurants and shopping in London.Extended pub opening hours over the bank holiday should provide a boost to the hospitality sector to the tune of \u00a3104m according to the Centre for Economics and Business Research.\"This would boost spending on any given weekend, but the special occasion of the Coronation itself should likely compound this by providing a special spending buzz, not unlike that seen during major events such as the Football World Cup,\" it said.Your complete guide to Coronation dayWhat time is the Coronation concert?"

It is one self-contained room with a kitchenette and a small bathroom accessed by its own door.He is part of thescheme which started just over a year ago to help rehome refugees who fled the country following Russia's invasion in February 2022.So far, according to government figures 153,000 Ukrainian refugees have arrived in the UK and research suggests most of them have stayed.To help with the expense of housing refugees, hosts are provided with \u00a3350 per month for the first 12 months and \u00a3500 for each month after that point.Like millions of other fixed-rate mortgage holders in the UK, Dominik's loan was coming up for renewal this year so he decided to look around for a new deal.And that's when the trouble - and worry - started.Halifax sent someone to value Dominik's home.He said: \"We spoke directly with the valuer before, when he came and looked at our house.\"But Dominik said \"When we contacted the Halifax through our broker they said they could not provide us with a mortgage because we were providing accommodation to a Ukrainian family and therefore there was a significant risk that we would rent out the room commercially in the future.\"Halifax has since apologised for \"the confusion\" after being contacted by Money Box and has offered Dominik a mortgage deal.But Dominik claims the only reason Halifax backed down is because Money Box started to investigate. \"We raised it twice with the Halifax through our mortgage broker and nothing changed,\" he said.\"It is very unfortunate that it took Money Box to get a response.\"Halifax said it is \"very sorry for the confusion\" and is very supportive of the Homes for Ukraine scheme and that it wouldn't decline a mortgage application on this basis.\"Having reviewed the application again, we've now issued an offer and the application will proceed as normal,\" it said.Halifax said the valuer did not appreciate the informal nature of the tenancy, and this was reflected in their report where they noted the property was unsuitable for these lending purposes and given a zero valuation.Dominik said that he was worried that Halifax's refusal could have been mirrored by the rest of the lending sector. \"We did not know at the time if other banks might have reacted similarly,\" he said.\"We have since secured a mortgage with another bank so, fortunately, it has not had any impact on our finances.\"He added: \"Had we not been able to secure a new mortgage we would have moved from a fixed-term mortgage to a higher rate and cost us over \u00a39,000 a year.\"The government has advised people who are hosting refugees through the Homes for Ukraine scheme to keep any interested parties informed.Are you part of the Homes for Ukraine scheme and hosting a family, or know someone who is, have you had any problems like Dominik?

Many of them were pet owners who had to leave their dogs and cats behind, hoping it would only be a matter of days before they were able to return to them.It wasn\u2019t long before Ukrainian veterinarians Valentina and Leonid Stoyanov learned that many pets were locked in nearby homes.\u201cAfter one, two weeks \u2026 neighbors just start hear (sic) how a lot of different animals around them screaming,\u201d Valentina told CNN.At the time, the couple specialized in exotic animal and wildlife rescue. With the invasion came a new mission: caring for these beloved but abandoned pets.The Stoyanovs began working with local police to access homes to rescue dogs and cats. Within a week of the invasion, Leonid said they were caring for some 400 animals in their Odesa clinic.\u201cEach animal for us, it\u2019s like members of our family,\u201d Valentina said.For the last decade, the couple has worked together treating more unusual animals and wildlife. Before the war, their videos of the monkeys, snakes, owls, and other creatures they rescued and cared for found a growing audience on their \u201cVet Crew\u201dandfeeds.Valentina said their \u201csimple life\u201d has changed drastically.\u201cAll our family \u2013 mother, father \u2013 have to leave Ukraine,\u201d Leonid said. \u201cBut we decided we stay here and help animals \u2013 a lot of animals.\u201dTheir clinic is partially underground and surrounded by taller buildings offering some protection from Russian attacks. But the lack of electricity is one of their most serious challenges. The couple needed to find a generator to keep the lights on and their reptiles warm.The Stoyanovs purchased tons of dog and cat food that they distribute to area shelters. They have also often driven to the front lines to help animals in need. Leonid recalls wearing body armor on his many trips vaccinating and feeding dogs there.\u201cRussian army a lot of times shooting our car and they bombed it. And one time they missed (by) maybe ten meters. And we have a lot of holes in our car,\u201d he said.During the last year, Leonid\u2019s health also took a turn for the worse. He suffered a heart attack and said he was clinically dead for several minutes before doctors were able to revive him.\u201cThey say, \u201cYou have a lot of animals. You need to (be) here,\u201d he said.He has since had two surgeries, including one to implant a pacemaker. And despite some discomfort, he says he feels \u201cphysically normal\u201d now.The Stoyanovs usually try to find new homes for the animals they rescue, or they release wild animals back into their natural habitat. But it was a different story for a blind husky named Casper, now a permanent member of the Stoyanov family. He belonged to a Ukrainian soldier named Sergei who had no family and asked the couple to care for his dog while he was away fighting.\u201cIt was very touching moment when Casper and \u2026 Sergei say goodbye (to) each other. Because Sergei crying and Casper also crying,\u201d Valentina said.Sergei would call every week, but after about two months, Casper began acting strangely and cried. The Stoyanovs later learned that this was around the time when Sergei was killed, Leonid said.\u201cIt\u2019s very, very depressive situation (here),\u201d Leonid said. \u201cWe cannot sleep because we are nervous. \u2026 We have a lot of work, a lot of animals, a lot of people dying, a lot of our friends dying.\u201dDespite all of the challenges, the couple say they have no plans to stop.\u201cWe just hold on and continue to do what we do because we see how it is important for animals, for all these lives around us,\u201d Valentina said.The Stoyanovs are grateful for the support they receive online from their social media community, whom they call their Vet Crew Family. They said it\u2019s their encouragement that keeps them going.\u201cWithout these people, what we do here right now in Ukraine will not be possible. And this is why all these people (become) family for us,\u201d Valentina said. \u201cAnd I think most important message for all of them, it is \u2026 thank you.\u201d"

Its 12.8 acres sold that year for \u00a3959 million ($1.2 billion) to the development company Qatari Diar in one of the priciest residential real estate deals in the world. The site now includes nearly 450 residences built in several phases; properties currently up for sale include a \u00a35.7 million two-bedroom residence and a \u00a355 million townhouse. Surrounding the homes' white limestone and iron exteriors are public gardens, which make up 40% of the site's grounds, according to Richard Oakes, who leads sales and marketing at Qatari Diar.Inside the 'Bentley' of luxury residential towers, opening in Miami\"We took inspiration from the formal Georgian(-era) squares of Belgravia and positioned all of the townhouses and residential buildings around a series of landscaped public gardens and spaces, ensuring the development is accessible to the local community and evolves as a natural addition to Belgravia,\" Oakes said over email. He called the project \"a historic collaboration between the best master planners and creative minds in architecture and design.\"The townhouse includes a 39-foot-long private pool as well as a spa, rooftop terace and screening room.Designed by PDP London and interiors studio Albion Nord, the new six-story townhouse spans nearly 15,000 square feet and features eight bedrooms, a gym, 39-foot-long swimming pool, spa, rooftop terrace and film screening room.Below ground, subterranean pathways connect the property to private parking and Chelsea Barracks' shared amenities building, the Garrison Club \u2014 which includes more pools, a gym, and leisure areas. A separate two-floor residence is also accessible via a private garden for welcoming and housing guests.A private back garden leads to the two-story Mews House for welcoming and hosting guests.Oakes said the design team opted for a modern take on architecture from the 18th and early 19th-century Georgian period, which follows classical proportions and symmetry.\"We were able to add all modern touches and features, without compromising the townhouse's design or exterior architecture,\" he said. The materials include \"elegant and understated\" materials such as English timber herringbone and marble, brass hardware, and metalwork balconies inspired by the late 19th-century Arts and Crafts movement, he added.The world's skinniest skyscraper is ready for its first residentsPreserving the barracks' architectural spirit has been fundamental to the project, Oakes said.\"As we set out to design an entirely new neighborhood that connects seamlessly with Belgravia and is open and accessible, we still wanted to remember and celebrate the site's history,\" he explained. \"Thanks to many years of thoughtful planning, design and construction, I believe we've succeeded in doing that.\""

She has shown us how architecture changes lives for the better... She has reacted imaginatively and creatively making affordable projects that address the real and often urgent need for accommodation, and basic services.\"Now focusing on the repair and regeneration of a key district of historic Lahore, Lari's work builds on her commitment to recycling materials and buildings. \"Architecture isn't just about the brick and mortar,\" she toldCNN Style last year. \"It's about seeing how you can help build communities.\""

For many, this constant bad news adds to the stress of everyday life, which may already feel overwhelming.According to the, each year in the US, one in five adults experience mental illness and one in six children aged 6 to 17 experience a mental health disorder. That\u2019s millions of people. In 2021, less than half of adults received treatment.America\u2019s mental health crisis is having a widespread impact that touches everyone.\u201cOne of the things that we underestimate as a society is how our global mental health impacts us as individuals. And we have seen it over and over again as we experience gun violence,\u201d said Michele Neff Hernandez, a 2021 CNN Hero who has helped millions navigate grief and loss through her nonprofit. \u201cWe can see what happens when people don\u2019t get the help they need; there can be tragic consequences.\u201dNeff Hernandez is one of many CNN Heroes who have found unique ways to help people with their mental health. Some of them marked Mental Health Awareness Month by sharing advice and insight with CNN\u2019s Elizabeth Belanger about what is working for their communities. Below are edited versions of their conversations.For, whose organization helps widowed people connect with each other in a community of support, it\u2019s important for everyone to know they aren\u2019t alone in their struggle. Mental illness is common, yet the stigma surrounding it is often a hurdle for people seeking the treatment they need.When our body isn\u2019t working well, going to a doctor to seek the cause or to help alleviate symptoms is considered normal and even responsible. Yet, when we are struggling with our mental health for any reason \u2013 including grieving a death, experiencing a traumatic event, even coping with the global and national crises that are a part of our daily narrative \u2013 we so often hesitate to seek mental health support. The pervasive stigmatizing narrative that implies that seeking mental health support shows weakness or that a mental illness or the breakdown of our mental health for any reason is something to be ashamed of has a significantly negative impact on our society, especially our young people.We have to model good mental health care by learning about mental health with the same vigor we use to learn about physical health. Imagine if meditation were as popular as weight loss. Or if picking up your mood stabilizing medication was viewed in the same way as picking up your blood pressure medication. Normalizing caring for and seeking help with mental health is a gift we can give ourselves and the next generation. We all need mental health support at many times in our lives; what a gift it would be if accessing that help were viewed as just part of normal life.We see this in grief all the time: No one wants to allow people to be sad. We seek to fix instead of listen. We pressure grieving people to \u201cget over it\u201d to make others more comfortable. We set the definition of success after a traumatic event as \u201creturning to normal,\u201d even when returning to a past normal is impossible. The truth is we are always changed by the challenges we overcome, and integrating what we\u2019ve learned about ourselves in the aftermath is one of the key elements of building resilience. When we stigmatize mental health care, we create an environment that ensures that the people who most need help will suffer alone.is a 2014 CNN Hero and the founder of, a bereavement center in Baltimore, Maryland. Their programs reach more than 4,000 people of all ages each year. In 2021, the organization moved into a new state-of-the-art center where it hosts in-person support groups and serves people who are suffering all types of loss.March-Grier stresses the importance of putting yourself first to enhance mental well-being.Everyone is looking for some kind of balance, yet few are finding it. Your state of mind is where it all begins. Make self-care a priority for your mental wellness. \u201cSelf-care is not selfish.\u201d It is a truth that if you don\u2019t take care of yourself, you will have nothing to give others. This includes healthy relationships that can be jeopardized because of stress, burnout, and lack of self-care. Your physical health is also connected to your mental health. Negative thoughts and suppression of these can cause dis-ease, and over time this leads to disease.Self-care means taking time out for self, creating a gratitude list, journaling, dancing, laughing, breathing fully, smelling the fresh air, being aware of surroundings, being in the moment, enjoying the stillness when you can, taking time out for self, playing with your pet, exercising, reflecting on the past, dreaming about the future, eating healthy, helping someone in need. All of these self-care activities increase the body\u2019s endorphins and bring on relaxation and balance.Sports helped 2012 CNN Heroovercome his addiction to drugs and alcohol. He foundedin 2007 to provide free athletic activities and a sober support community to others battling addiction. Today, the organization is in more than 200 communities nationwide with nearly 200,000 members.Strode\u2019s work focuses on the intersection of exercise and personal connection to benefit mental health.Social connection is a powerful tool for creating positive mental health. At The Phoenix, every day we see the profound impact that belonging and social connection has on our members\u2019 confidence and overall well-being. Just spending a few minutes daily in the presence of others can be inherently powerful, and thankfully it is now easier than ever to make these vital connections.Whether it\u2019s getting together for an activity or just talking about challenges being faced, social connectivity can help us all overcome mental health challenges.Exercise can also be a powerful tool to improve mental health. We encourage you to get out for a 15- to 30-minute walk or run and consider inviting a friend to join you. Sharing these physical activities with supportive peers can create the vulnerability to begin to share about what else you might be experiencing.Service dogs are often a helpful tool for members of the military returning from deployment and afflicted by conditions like PTSD, depression, and anxiety. 2012 CNN Herononprofit,, has helped nearly 600 veterans, first responders, and others train their own service dogs.Cortani emphasizes that not all wounds are visible, and silence is not a treatment for mental illness.If the world has taught me anything, it has taught me to remember to be kind, do not judge what you cannot see. Pain is invisible. With all the craziness going on every day, breathe. It is okay to feel down, to feel overloaded, overwhelmed, sad, frustrated. Try not to hold onto it. Seek help, talk to your family, friends, pastor, priest \u2013 talk to someone. And for those listening, really hear, pay attention, because sometimes the silence says more than the words. There is no shame to ask for help. It takes courage, and we all have it within us.Impact Your World: Here's how you can get mental health helpIt takes all of us to realize mental health needs to be talked about, not buried under the rug. We need open, honest conversations; we have a mental health crisis in this country that is only getting worse as we become more divided. Fear only adds to it. Mental health doesn\u2019t just affect veterans and first responders; it can affect everyone. Trauma is trauma, and enough repeated exposure changes the brain. There is hope, and there can be healing, but we all need to work together to help those who need our help.We need to stop the silence surrounding mental health and model healthy behaviors so that we can assist with support and help guide towards resources. We are not in this alone, nor are those suffering from mental health issues."

        "text": "Editor\u2019s Note:If your area is under a, seek shelter immediately. Tornadoes can pose a threat at any strength, and warnings can go out with only a few minutes to prepare. Take them seriously: It could save your life.Tornadoes are one of Earth\u2019s most violent natural forces.They have whipped up in all 50 US states \u2013 and across the globe \u2013 at various times of year, sometimes causing untold devastation. But despite strides in their study, there\u2019s still so much scientists don\u2019t know about them.\u201cThere is no perfect formula for forming a tornado,\u201d said CNN meteorologist Brandon Miller, a storm chaser who\u2019s has been following and studying these storms since 2005.\u201cSometimes, it may appear that a storm is in a perfect environment for a tornado to form, yet it never does. Conversely, tornadoes frequently form in marginal environments where it seems like one or more \u2018ingredients\u2019 to storm formation is missing or lacking,\u201d he said.Still, there are some common factors anyone can look for to understand the life cycle of a developing storm that could produce a tornado. They are:In the developing phase of the thunderstorm, warm air rises and fluffy whitecumulus clouds begin to grow.The clouds grow taller and taller, even before rain or thunder appears.Then, the bottom of the clouds darken and the very top could flatten out, creating a protruding anvil shape that indicates very cold air at the top and could be aAs warm as rises, cold air is pushed down. This results in wind speed and direction changing with height within the storm \u2013 a phenomenon called wind shear.Wind shear helps the storm begin to rotate and become what\u2019s called a supercell.In this maturing phase, heavy rain, lightning, hail and very strong winds are expected.Sometimes, a strong gust of wind \u2013 called a gust front \u2013 blows a few moments before rain arrives. It\u2019s caused by cool air being forced down from the storm cloud. When the cold air hits the ground, it spreads out quickly ahead of the storm and is a sure sign a storm is near.\u201cNearly all supercells produce some sort of severe weather (large hail or damaging winds) but only 30 percent or less produce tornadoes,\u201dNational Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.Tornadoes usually form from supercells when the right ingredients are in place to help them thrive:\u2022in the atmosphere, which allows air to rise;\u2022, the rising itself;\u2022 and most critically,: when winds at different heights within the supercell blow in different directions.The wind shear creates a horizontally rotating column of air within the thunderstorm cloud.Then, two key forces inside the supercell can act on the rotating air column:\u2022 the updraft \u2013 or the rising of warm air \u2013 lifts the horizontal air column,\u2022 while the downdraft \u2013 an area of drier air pushed down from the storm \u2013 twists the column so it\u2019s vertical, then wraps around its backside.The resulting vertical column of air is called a funnel cloud until it touches the ground \u2013 when it becomes a tornado.\u201cThe most telltale sign that a tornado could be forming, when you are looking at a close-range severe thunderstorm, is the \u2018wall cloud,\u2019\u201d Miller said.The wall cloud is a lowering of the darkened cloud base that leads to the air rotation. While the presence of a wall cloud doesn\u2019t always mean a tornado will form, it certainly ups the odds.\u201cYou will know you are looking at a wall cloud because it will hang noticeably lower than the rest of the thunderstorm, and you may notice it is rotating if you look closely,\u201d Miller said.Tornadoes can disappear as quickly as they appear \u2013 often morphing from roaring funnels of fury into nothing in seconds \u2013 when a key ingredient is lost, Miller said.Sometimes as a thunderstorm evolves, its source of warm, moist air is cut off, causing a tornado to die, he said.Tornado-producing supercells also can merge with other storms, forming into a so-called \u201csquall line,\u201d which generally kills a tornado, Miller said. Squall lines, though, have their own dangers, including gusty winds that can stretch for hundreds of miles \u2013 and even spin up quick tornadoes of their own.CNN\u2019s Jackson Dill and CNN meteorologist Haley Brink contributed to this report."

Another 3,600 were ordered to evacuate from Little Red River Cree Nation.Another out-of-control wildfire dubbed EWF-031 has burned about 77,920 hectares of land, about 192,500 acres, as it rages southeast of the town of Edson in Yellowhead County, according toAlberta Premier Danielle Smith has said it\u2019s an \u201cunprecedented situation our province is facing.\u201d\u201cWe have so many fires, so spread out and it\u2019s because we\u2019ve seen unprecedented conditions this spring. \u2026 It\u2019s been an unusual year,\u201d Tucker said.CNN\u2019s Amy Simonson contributed to this report."

        "text": "Theof King Charles III on Saturday was a historic day, jam-packed with events \u2013 some planned, others not.CNN takes a look at some of the most memorable moments.Charles was hidden from view for the most dramatic part of the service at London\u2019s Westminster Abbey on Saturday.Behind a three-sided screen, the Dean of Westminster poured holy oil from the Ampulla, a gold eagle-shaped flask, on to the Coronation Spoon, and then the Archbishop of Canterbury anointed Charles on his head, breast and hands, according to the Church of England\u2019s liturgy.The 12th-century, silver-gilt spoon is the oldest object used in coronations. In the background, the Choir of Westminster Abbey sang the anthemic \u201cZadok the Priest\u201d by George Frideric Handel, which was composed for the coronation of King George II in 1727 and performed at every British coronation since.Once he re-emerged, the Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby placed St. Edward\u2019s Crown upon Charles III\u2019s head. It was the only time Charles will ever wear St. Edward\u2019s Crown, which is reserved for the coronation of a new monarch; the crown was made for the new King\u2019s namesake, Charles II, in 1661.After crowning Charles, Welby shouted: \u201cGod Save the King.\u201d Those in attendance repeated the words.Soon after, Camilla was also crowned. Like her husband, she was anointed with holy oil by the Archbishop of Canterbury \u2013 this time in full view of the audience \u2013 before having Queen Mary\u2019s Crown placed on her head.Music underpinned the entire celebration, in keeping with history. Each stage was marked by either a grand choral work, an ethereal motet, an extravagant organ composition or an evocative melody, all performed by some of the most accomplished singers and musicians in the world.King Charles and Queen Camilla entered the abbey to the strains of \u201cI was glad,\u201d the stirring coronation anthem written by Hubert Parry for the coronation of King Edward VII in 1902 and sung at all coronations since then.But the old was blended with the new; Charles had asked Andrew Lloyd Webber \u2013 whose music is more familiar to audiences in the West End than congregations in Westminster Abbey \u2013 to write a Coronation Anthem, \u201cMake a Joyful Noise,\u201d which played after Camilla was enthroned.And this event featured the first ever appearance by a gospel choir at a coronation; dressed in resplendent white, the Ascension Choir performed \u2018Alleluia\u2019 just before the Archbishop\u2019s sermon.Thousands of people had packed into Westminster Abbey.Decked in a teal cape and cap with gold detailing, a woman in blue commanded attention as she wielded an important object of the coronation regalia \u2013 theor the Jewelled Sword, before and after the, when it was used. But who is she?Penny Mordaunt is a Conservative lawmaker in the United Kingdom, and has been since 2010.She was involved in the ceremony because, as the current Leader of the House of Commons, she is also the Lord President of the Privy Council \u2013 a body formed of senior politicians who act as the monarch\u2019s official advisers.The council\u2019s president is involved in a variety of royal ceremonies, acting as a symbolic bridge between the King or Queen and the country\u2019s elected officials. Mordaunt spoke at the, two days after the Queen\u2019s death.was a regal sight in ivory, silver and gold. But who was she wearing?Unsurprisingly, it was a British designer,, who she has a longstanding relationship with.Simple, tailored and cut from Peau de Soie, a silk fabric with a dull luster finish, her coronation dress was more akin to a coat dress with an embroidered underskirt as opposed to a traditional dress.Arriving at Westminster Abbey before the service, her dress was protected by the crimson velvet and ermine Robe of State that was originally made for Queen Elizabeth\u2019s coronation.Peeping out beneath her dress were shoes in the same silk as her clothing, made by British designer Elliot Zed.Never one to disappoint at royal events, Prince Louis, the youngest child of the Prince and Princess of Wales, again stole the show during segments of the coronation ceremony.Keen-eyed viewers may have noticed the 5-year-old yawning, sitting between his mother, the Princess of Wales, and sister Princess Charlotte, but then pulling a disappearing act from the service.It was thought the young royal might leave early, but luckily for fans, he returned before the end of the service.For those who don\u2019t remember, Louis gained global infamy during the late Queen\u2019s Platinum Jubilee celebrations in June, where he was captured throwing aand covering his ears while screaming during the.Meanwhile, there was widespread speculation before Saturday as to whetherwould be at his father\u2019s coronation.The Duke of Sussex attended the coronation ceremony at Westminster Abbey on Saturday, sitting in the third row.Wearing a morning suit with his military medals, Harry arrived alongside his uncles, Prince Edward and Prince Andrew, and two of his cousins, Princess Beatrice and Princess Eugenie.Prince Harry attended without his wife, Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex, who reportedly stayed back in the US with their children on the account of Archie\u2019s fourth birthday.The coronation marked the first time the prince publicly met members of his family since the release of his memoir,After it ended, he was seen talking and smiling with his cousins amidst a downpour, before he took a car on his own.He did not appear with members of the royal family to greet the public from the balcony of Buckingham Palace on Saturday afternoon \u2013 a flagship part of royal events.CNN understands that Prince Harry did not receive an invitation to join the family for this balcony moment, which featured a slimmed-down flypast by the Royal Air Force. Prince Andrew wasn\u2019t present either.The weather did not favor King Charles \u2013 and while crowds seemed unperturbed by the rain, it did alter plans for the traditional Royal Air Force flypast.The display was formed only of helicopters and the colorful Red Arrows, and not the expected Typhoons, Spitfires, Hurricanes and Lancaster bombers.But crowds instead enjoyed not one but two appearances on the balcony by the new King and Queen, who provided an encore after seemingly waving goodbye to supporters.That wrapped up an eventful day, which had drawn thousands onto London\u2019s streets."

Heavy snow, torrential rain, gusty winds and possible record cold high temperatures will make for a pretty miserable start to the week weather-wise.Meteorologists from the National Weather Service office in Marquette, Michigan, are describing the event as \u201ca historic late spring snowstorm the likes of which we have not seen here in Upper Michigan since May of 1990.\u201dParts of Michigan\u2019s Upper Peninsula have already seen up to 18 inches of snow and another two feet are possible through Tuesday.\u201cGiven the late-season event, surface temperatures hovering around freezing will lead to a very heavy, wet snow, which may result in downed trees and powerlines,\u201d the Weather Prediction Center said.Along with heavy snow, winds will be gusting up to 50 mph across the Upper Midwest, which will add to the danger of falling trees.Up to 100 homes damaged and schools closed after tornado strikes Virginia BeachThe reason is a strong area of low pressure, which has stalled out over the Great Lakes region. It is bringing strong effects, felt for a longer duration, simply because the storm is not moving.\u201cSeveral locations (are) potentially approaching May monthly low-pressure records,\u201d the prediction center mentioned in its forecast discussion.As barometric pressure drops, it can be an indication of how strong a storm is. In this case, the pressure over the Great Lakes is equivalent to a strong tropical storm or low-end Category 1 hurricane.The steady stream of strong winds will cause incredible wave heights across portions of the Great Lakes as well.\u201cThe strong north winds will cause waves to build into the 15 to 20 feet range along the shores of Lake Superior today into tonight resulting in possible lakeshore flooding for portions of eastern Marquette and Alger counties,\u201d the weather service office in Marquette said.Flood watches are in effect across the region for not only the lakeshore flooding, but the additional river rise expected from snowmelt.Mississippi River crest reaches historic proportions as Iowans cope with yet another floodTemperatures across the Midwest, Great Lakes and Ohio Valley are running 10 to 20 degrees below normal early this week and more than 60 cold temperature records could be broken.Here are a few cities expected to break records for cold high temperatures. All will experience temperatures more typical for early March:The system will finally push out by midweek, moving into the mid-Atlantic and Northeast by Wednesday. I know many of you in the Northeast are tired of rain, after the miserable and dreary weekend, but this week is unfortunately going to remain unsettled. Rain and normal temperatures will settle in.\u201cBelow-average temperatures will spill into the mid-Atlantic and Northeast, with nighttime lows dipping into the low 40s across nearly the entirety of the I-95 urban corridor,\u201d the prediction center said.Some of the higher elevations like the Pocono Plateau could even see a little snow.\u201cIf some wet flakes do mix in, no impacts are expected (besides asking yourself \u201cisn\u2019t it May?\u201d),\u201d the weather service office in New York City pointed out in its forecast discussion.For the rest of the Northeast, the precipitation type will be all rain, on top of what has already been a soaking weekend.Yesterday Portland, Maine set a new daily rainfall record after picking up 2.5 inches of rain. Central Park in New York City also broke a daily rainfall record on Saturday after recording 2.46 inches of rain.Much of the late-season misery should be pushed out by the second half of the week, nudging temperatures warmer and closer to where they should be this time of year, just in time for the weekend.CNN Meteorologistcontributed to this report."

        "text": "Written byIn recent years, 3D-printing has been used to build everything from homes to businesses and even bridges. Now, Dubai is set to construct the world's first 3D-printed mosque.The structure will accommodate 600 worshippers and cover 2,000 square meters over two floors, according to Ali Mohammad Alhalyan Alsuwaidi, head of engineering at the Dubai Government's Islamic Affairs and Charitable Activities Department (IACAD). It will be made from a concrete mix, with construction planned to begin by the end of year and expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2025.\"We elected to 3D-print the mosque because it's a new and innovative technology that can potentially save time and resources compared to traditional building methods,\" Alhalyan Alsuwaidi said. IACAD declined to name the company that will be responsible for the construction.Constructing buildings using 3D-printing requires large printing machines that are programmed with the design information. They squeeze out the construction material from a nozzle, building up the structure in layers. The vast majority of 3D-printed structures are made from concrete, but it is possible to print using other materials, such asclay.A rendering of the 3D-printed mosque, which will be built in Bur Dubai.Dubai has set out to becomethe 3D-printing capital of the world, and in 2018 it launched a \"3D Printing Strategy\" that planned for 25% of the emirate's new construction to be 3D-printed by 2030.By 2019 it held the world record for the largest 3D-printed structure -- the Dubai Municipality building (standing 9.5 meters tall with an area of 640 square meters) -- as well as being home to the world'sfirst 3D-printed office, and a 3D-printeddrone research laboratory.But new 3D-printed buildings are popping up across the world -- fromhousing for refugeesin Jordan and forhomeless people in Austin, Texas, to whole complexes of buildings, such as the 3,800 square foot (353 square meter)Camp Swift military training center, and entire neighborhoods, like theNew Story project in Tabasco, Mexico, which will provide homes for families living in poverty.A 3D-printing company is preparing to build on the lunar surface. But first, a moonshot at homeTheo Salet is dean of the Department of the Built Environment at Eindhoven University of Technology, in the Netherlands. He is an advocate for modernizing the construction industry through technology such as 3D-printing.\"A vast amount of construction work needs to be done in the coming decades, in the context of a lack of skilled construction workers, an energy transition and a need for the industry to become more sustainable,\" he said.\"Digital design and construction will save time ... reduce construction costs and costs of failures, solve the problem of a lack of construction workers and allow us to rethink our designs in terms of sustainability,\" he added.He believes that a project like Dubai's proposed mosque is the next phase in 3D-printed architectural design, but anticipates it will face challenges.\"Realizing a large and eye-catching project like this is quite a task, of a scale yet unknown,\" he said. \"Without any doubt the 3D printing will work -- however, rendered drawings make promises that must be (possible) to meet in practice ... A project of this scale and ambition is, in my opinion, a project to learn from and mistakes should be possible.\""

        "name": "Italian food: Classic dishes everyone needs to try",
        "link": "https://edition.cnn.com/travel/article/classic-italian-dishes/index.html",
        "text": "Think of Italy and you\u2019re likely to think of food first and all theto see second.Italian cuisine \u2013 or some version of it \u2013 has colonized the rest of the world so successfully that there are probably uncharted corners of the Amazon rainforest where you can sit down at a red-and-white checkered tablecloth and order up a plate ofand sauce.There\u2019s a reason the food is so good. Actually, there are hundreds of reasons scattered throughout the different. If you can\u2019t get to them all, here are some top classics:Italy\u2019s gift to TV box set bingers, deadline busters and delivery scooter manufacturers needs no introduction. Pizzas can be summoned to almost anywhere on the planet \u2013 including an\u2013 within 30 minutes provided there\u2019s a phone connection and worthwhile tip.But that greasy slice you\u2019re eating out of a box (for breakfast? Seriously?) is a far cry from the real thing. A trueis thick, tender and has an elasticity when chewed. It\u2019s traditionally dressed with fresh tomatoes, extra virgin olive oil, basil leaves and melting mozzarella or fior di latte cheese \u2013 or simply plain white pizza. The most savory is buffalo milk mozzarella.Many atrocities have been committed in the name of pizza science \u2013anyone? Or pineapple pizza? But the original still never tastes better than in Naples, the city of its birth.The rest of the world calls it \u201cspaghetti bolognese.\u201d But the rest of the world is wrong. This perfect blend of delicate rag\u00f9 sauce and fresh golden tagliatelle pasta is a signature of the northern Emilia Romagna region, in particular the city of Bologna. Hence the global name.Legend has it the tagliatelle shape was inspired by the curly blond hair of fearsome 16th-century Italian noblewoman Lucrezia Borgia. The rag\u00f9 is made with finely chopped or ground pieces of pork and beef mixed with celery, carrots, onions, tomato sauce and red wine.Parmigiano Reggiano cheese is grated on top, like a snow-capped peak. The original ancient recipe is protected by the Azdore, \u201cpasta priestesses\u201d who prepare fresh tagliatelle for clients each day across the region at fresh pasta boutiques.Few ingredients go into making this dish, but the secret is in their quality and the way they stick to the tube shaped pasta. Pecorino cheese, pork cheek and raw organic eggs are all that\u2019s needed for Rome\u2019s specialty dish.Being a heavy and protein-rich meal, it\u2019s usually served at dinner. The homemade rigatoni, must be \u201cal dente\u201d \u2013 cooked to exactly the point when it\u2019s neither soft nor hard\u2013 so the dense egg-rich dressing clings without leaking into the plate. Spaghetti can also be used, preferably the homemade type with a gritty surface.Carbonara may owe its creation to American influence \u2013 it\u2019s likely that pasta with egg and bacon flourished with the arrival of the American troops in Italy during World War II \u2013 but Romans, and Italians in general, like to stick to an indigenous tale according to which the dish was a favorite of charcoal burners working on the cold Apennine Mountains.Casu marzu: The world's 'most dangerous' cheeseThe word pesto literally means \u201ccrush\u201d in Genoese. In this case, basil, Parmigiano Reggiano cheese, pine kernels, garlic cloves, coarse salt and extra virgin olive oil, pulverized together in a Genoese marble mortar. They combine to create a dense, creamy sauce that smells of a Mediterranean garden and cries out to be stirred through a bowl of handmade trofie pasta twists.This dish is at its best in Genoa, in northwestern Liguria, a land of seafarers and adventurers. The region was a spice trade hub in the Middle Ages, when use of herbs and flowers to flavor food became commonplace.A legacy of these times, pesto flourished in the 1800s based on an earlier, older recipe made with garlic called \u201cagliata.\u201dFreezer-ready superstore versions of this classic \u2013 more suited to propping open doors or breaking windows \u2013 have done it few favors over the years. But if made well with rich layers of rag\u00f9, b\u00e9chamel sauce and Parmigiano cheese oozing between hand-made \u201csfoglia\u201d sheets of fresh flat pasta, it\u2019s still heavenly.Eaten via recipes that use either spinach or tomatoes, lasagne is closely linked to the northern city of modern Bologna, but it traces its origins to Roman times.It was, reputedly, philosopher Cicero\u2019s favorite because its refinement and softness was easier to digest than many others found his outspoken beliefs. He\u2019s said to have gulped down huge quantities up until he was killed.Solo diners should avoid ordering this dish, unless they\u2019re: A) really hungry. B) massively into fish. Brodetto is a fish soup of gigantic proportions. It\u2019s served as a single main course but usually takes two people to finish.Ray, mullet, sole, redfish and prawns gaze up from the bubbling pot, swimming in a pool alongside semi-ripe tomatoes, parsley and garlic. Grilled bread slices are dropped in before the eating starts and left to absorb the fishy liquid.Once all the fish is gone, it\u2019s time to devour the soaked bread. At the very end, thin spaghetti, called capelli d\u2019angelo (or angel hair), is thrown inside the pot and mixed with the remaining sea broth.It\u2019s a topsy-turvy meal typical of Vasto on the Adriatic coast.Handmade pasta shaped like knots are stuffed with pork loin, ham, Mortadella salami, Parmigiano cheese, eggs and nutmeg and thrown in a thick capon broth.Spurious legend has it that a voyeuristic innkeeper in Bologna was peeking through a keyhole to spy on Venus, Mars and Bacchus in the middle of a hot and heavy threesome. He caught just a glimpse of the goddess\u2019 perfect belly button and tried to reproduce it in pasta form.Voila! Tortellino was born.The original recipe is protected by the Confraternity of Tortellino, die-hard purists who don\u2019t tolerate creative twists.Many towns in the Emilia Romagna region claim to be the originators of this staple dish, but there\u2019s staunch rivalry between three: Modena, Bologna and Castelfranco Emilia, a small town halfway between them.Yes, we know that \u201cgenuine\u201d gelato places have opened in your neighborhood. And we know it\u2019s good.But it\u2019s still not as good as the stuff you can eat anywhere in Italy, with warm evening sun on your face and an orchestra of ancient Vespas revving in the background.Gelato is said to have been inspired by ancient Sicilians, who mixed fruit juice with snow from Mount Etna. Today, recipes call for milk, cream, sugar and eggs.Traditional local flavors include pistachios, toasted almonds, nuts, lemons, mandarin oranges, figs and cactus figs.It can be savored on its own or together with a brioche bun as the Sicilians do. Bun pieces are used to scoop the gelato, which can also be spread inside like a peanut butter sandwich.50 of the world's best dessertsThis dish is made from dried fish.No, stay with us! This isn\u2019t the gelatinous reconstituted fish of Scandinavian nightmares. This is a far more delicious proposition.The secret is in the preparation \u2013 a recipe invented by merchants from Vicenza in the 1500s and protected by a brotherhood of chefs. Dried cod is softened by beating and then placed under running water for two days. Then extra virgin olive oil, milk, Parmigiano, onions and anchovies are added and cooked slowly so that the ingredients penetrate into each other.It\u2019s said that while savoring it, your mouth should feel the living fish still swimming in the ocean, a scenario which, we admit, is slightly nightmarish.This dish of boiled cornmeal mush is best served as a steaming semi-liquid on a wooden platter. It can also be cooled, solidified, chopped into fingers and served grilled as rectangular finger foods.Once a peasant dish believed to have aphrodisiac powers, it\u2019s a great gluten-free substitute for bread. Having a neutral flavor, it\u2019s good with everything: rabbit, mushrooms, braised veal with tomato sauce and milk. Even Nutella.This fried, crispy golden globe artichoke, which makes a crunchy sound with each bite, is a delicacy of Rome\u2019s Jewish quarter.The criteria for selection is strict. Only the best variety are chosen. They\u2019re 15 centimeters (5.9 inches) wide, twice the normal size, and grow on the uppermost part of the plant that\u2019s absorbed the most sunlight.Once the rough leaves are delicately trimmed with a cobbler\u2019s knife, the artichoke is dipped twice in frying oil at different temperatures. Served as an appetizer, sometimes upside down with the stem in the air, overspilling the plate like a blooming flower.It\u2019s an Italian staple with an exotic taste. This creamy rice dish gets its golden color and soft texture from saffron. That\u2019s why it\u2019s also called risotto allo zafferano, although the Milanese call it by the more prosaic name,risotto giallo.Local carnaroli or arborio rice is cooked with veal broth, butter, Grana Padano cheese and sometimes bone marrow. The secret to making a great risotto alla Milanese lies in giving the rice time to absorb the flavors.As always, there\u2019s a backstory. This one centers on a Dutch artist who, at a posh dinner while he was on assignment decorating the windows of Milan\u2019s Duomo cathedral, served up a rice dish including the saffron he was using as a yellow dye. It proved an instant hit.Don\u2019t freak out if on your tour of Sardinia you come across village food fairs where baby piglets are staked and cooked over a bonfire. It\u2019s all perfectly normal around these parts, and if you like meat and you\u2019re not squeamish, we\u2019re sorry to report that crunchy piglet is delicious.Porceddu (meaning piglet in Sardinian) is a dish of baby pig that has fed solely on its mother\u2019s milk and weighs less than 8 kilograms (17.6 pounds). That ensures the meat is tender and has a less pungent taste.Once killed, it\u2019s roasted for hours in public squares and prepared in a variety of ways. While cooking, drops of liquid lard are poured over the piglet to make it crunchier and tastier. When ready to be served, it can be glazed with honey and sprinkled with herbs.Preparing it is a spectacle, and the secret to making a great crunchy porceddu lies in skillful rotation of the gigantic skewer so that the outer skin is crispy but not burned while the meat remains tender.The tragedy behind Italy's famous pasta dishAmatriciana sauce was born in the town of Amatrice, a town in Italy\u2019s central Lazio region, when a local recipe was adapted after tomatoes were brought here following the discovery of America.Since adopted as a Rome classic, its secret lies in choosing the right kind of pasta \u2013 and none does it better than bombolotti.These thick, wide macaroni have ridges that trap the sauce made from premium tomatoes, fried crispy pork cheek and a topping of grated savory Roman pecorino cheese. True to its name, the bombolottiexplodes deliciously in the mouth at first bite.Sweet-tasting veggies are not something typically ordered in Italy, but this extravagant Sicilian concoction will win anyone over. It\u2019s a sweet and sour mix of different vegetables dressed in a sauce of tomato extract, onions, celery, capers and olives.There are many caponata variations, but most use small potatoes, eggplant and bell peppers cooked with almonds, pine nuts, raisins, sugar, vinegar, extra virgin olive oil and fresh basil.It\u2019s no shock that a country famous for its desserts and famous for its coffee would find a way to combine them so sublimely. What is a shock is that this glorious combination was supposedly conjured up in a brothel.Tiramis\u00f9 is concocted of layers of Savoiardi ladyfinger biscuits dipped one by one in a whipped mixture of mascarpone cream cheese and a fine blend of different coffee powders. Chocolate powder is also sometimes added, but purists like to stick to just coffee.It\u2019s traditionally made in large trays and served in rectangular portions like lasagne.The name tiramis\u00f9 literally means \u201clift me up\u201d or \u201cpull me up\u201d \u2013 a reference to the restorative powers it apparently bestowed upon customers of brothels in the northern city of Treviso, allowing them to spend more money.Can\u2019t cook but want to learn to prepare great Italian food? Start here. This symbol of the Mediterranean diet is made simply by alternating slices of fresh tomatoes and mozzarella cheese dressed with extra virgin oil, salt, pepper and fresh basil leaves.The white of the mozzarella juxtaposed with the red of the tomato and the green of the basil is said to represent the Italian flag. Its birthplace is believed to be the chic island of Capri. Insalata Caprese means \u201csalad made the Capri-way.\u201dMeat addicts will love this dish originating from the northern region of Piedmont. Bollito simply means \u201cthe boil\u201d and is a feast of various meats. One single dish holds boiled pieces of seven different beef cuts plus parts of other animals: calf\u2019s head, chuck steak, ox tongue, ox tail, flank; one whole capon and one cotechino pork sausage.Carrots, onions, fresh rosemary, celery, garlic, salt and pepper are added to spice up this butcher\u2019s platter. The meat can then be dipped in a variety of bittersweet sauces.The trick is all in the timing and temperature. The longer the meats are boiled, the tastier they get, but there\u2019s a risk of destroying the flavor through overboiling.Meaning \u201csea rock\u201d in Italian, scoglio is a name that suits this dish of linguine entwined with calamari, clams, mussels, shrimp and baby prawns and dressed with chili pepper, parsley, tomatoes and a glug of white wine.It\u2019s a seafood pasta recipe hailing back to the ancient fishing traditions when families living along the coast ate their evening pasta with the fresh daily catch.Linguine, aka \u201csmall tongues,\u201d is a flat thin noodle ideal for seafood dishes. This dish resembles shoreline rocks after crashing waves have left behind a handful of marine life. The original recipe comes from Naples but has extended to most southern cities. In Rome, it\u2019s also served wrapped in tinfoil.Not to be tackled for lunch unless there\u2019s room for an afternoon nap, this tasty dish is an oozing stratification of fried eggplant slices, Pachino tomato sauce, eggs, fresh basil and caciocavallo or fior di latte cheese.The best eggplants are the oval, dark purple, fat ones ideal for frying. They can also be topped with grated, smoked ricotta.Despite the name, it has nothing to do with northern town of Parma but comes from deepest Sicily and is a popular dish mainly in southern Italy.25 delicious Italian dishes you might not knowThis dish is what happens when you let oxtail stew for hours in a huge pan of celery, carrots, onions and a liter of red wine. The best versions take two days, with ingredients simmered slowly over a low flame until the meat falls away from the bone at the touch of a tongue.At the end of the meal, grilled bruschetta slices are often dipped in the pan to mop up the remaining carrots, oxtail and celery sauce. This typical Roman dish, usually savored during festivities, is so tender it melts in the mouth.Italians don\u2019t usually like to mix meat and fish, but there are a few exceptions. One is vitello tonnato, aka veal covered in tuna cream.This unusual concoction sees boiled veal fillets sliced into circles and covered in a dense layer of mayonnaise mixed with shredded tuna, anchovies and capers. The concoction is typically served cold as an appetizer.It\u2019s a specialty of the Piedmont region, which bears the influence of past French conquerors.Malloreddus are tiny, shell-shaped, durum-wheat flour pasta that are served with a sauce of onions, sausage rag\u00f9 (preferably flavored with fennel) or dried salami and dressed with salty Sardinian pecorino cheese. Basil can also be added.The sauce gets trapped inside the malloreddus\u2019 tiny pockets. Local lore has it that the name of the pasta in regional dialect means \u201clittle bulls\u201d as their shape reminded shepherds of calves. It\u2019s a classic main course from Sardinia\u2019s southwest Campidano area.Tasty Roman pecorino cheese, blended with sprinkled black pepper, melts as soon as it mixes with the thick, curly tonnarelli spaghetti freshly pulled out of a pot of boiling water.The secret to making a great sauce is adding teaspoons of hot salty water from the boiling pasta pot to help the ingredients blend in a creamy, slightly adhesive sauce that sticks easily to the tonnarello.Cheese fanatics tend to add an extra layer of grated pecorino to make it even tastier. It\u2019s a simple Rome signature dish, found at typical trattoria.Those with a sweet tooth will adore this top Neapolitan pastry, which is fun to eat. There are two types of sfogliatella. The riccia, meaning \u201ccurly,\u201d is shaped like a shell and has crunchy layers of puff pastry stuffed with fresh sweet ricotta cheese, crushed candied orange bits, vanilla and cinnamon. It\u2019s sprinkled with sugar.When its corner is bitten off, the pastry unravels like woolen yarn exposing the inner filling.Ffrolla sfogliatella is roundish and stuffed with the same ingredients but wrapped in shortcrust pastry.Local poets have written sonnets praising the delicious taste of these \u201ctwo sisters.\u201d It\u2019s a street food sweet treat. In Naples, pastry stands sell sfogliatelle freshly made each day.These handmade ravioli are stuffed with mashed potatoes, chopped mint, garlic and grated Sardinian pecorino cheese. They\u2019re best savored straight, \u201cin white\u201d with no added sauce but just a bit of extra virgin olive oil or grated tuna eggs (bottarga). They\u2019re laid out on the plate to form a blossoming flower.Culurgiones are also eaten with tomato sauce and fresh basil. Hand-shaping them can be tricky; it takes time to learn how to properly do it.Once the ingredients are wrapped inside the dough, the borders are pinched together to form little lines resembling wheat spikes. A typical dish from Sardinia\u2019s Ogliastra region, in the past it was prepared as a festive treat to celebrate grain harvest, a sort of local Thanksgiving food.Hand-made squared ravioli with zig-zag edges filled with roasted meat, these are usually eaten either with veal broth, a rich meat sauce or with butter and sage.Being a highly nutritious dish, it\u2019s usually served at dinner and on special occasions. While the agnolotti are cooking, a glass of red wine can be poured over them to enhance the flavor. A thin layer of grated Parmigiano cheese is added at the end as topping. Plin is the final \u201cpinch\u201d given to close an agnolotto.In the past, farming families ate them without any sauce to best savor the Piedmont recipe\u2019s ingredients.This succulent rice dish was born on the border between Lombardy and Piedmont. Gorgonzola blue cheese is an ideal dressing for risotto. It has a delicate taste when added to locally grown rice varieties such as carnaroli that absorb the flavors during cooking.To make it, rice is cooked with vegetable broth with morsels of Gorgonzola thrown in at the end, just before butter and Parmigiano Reggiano cheese are added. Black pepper is sprinkled on top.Nuts and pieces of special sausages from the Piedmont town of Bra made with a mix of veal and pig fat can also be added to the dish.Gorgonzola cheese was, apparently, created by mistake. It\u2019s said that a young dairy man, eager to meet his girlfriend, forgot to finish his work and left the cheese pot outside. Instead of throwing away the almost rotten curd the next morning, he added a fresh layer. In between the two, green \u201cparsley\u201d looking veins of mold formed.Timballo is the art of recycling food leftovers from the day before or after a festive meal. It\u2019s the Italian equivalent of the Anglo-Saxon pie. Anything can go inside to stuff the shortcrust pastry as long as it\u2019s been previously cooked.Pasta, meat, cheese, vegetables, tortellini, eggs, sausages and even fish are mixed together with besciamella sauce and placed inside the dough, which is then folded and cooked in an oven.It\u2019s mostly eaten in central and northern Italy, with family recipes passed down through generations. Timballo was invented as a way to conserve expensive ingredients and make meals last for days.This article was first published in February 2021 and last updated in May 2023."

        "link": "https://edition.cnn.com/travel/article/nagoya-japan-things-to-do/index.html",
        "text": "Nagoya is an industrial powerhouse of some 2.3 million people at the center of an urban metropolis of about 10 million\u00a0in central Japan, about two-thirds of the way between the better-known cities of Tokyo and Osaka.Yet few international travelers visiting Japan experience it.Nagoya might not have the international draw of Tokyo, Kyoto or Osaka, but it certainly doesn\u2019t deserve the sobriquet of \u201cJapan\u2019s most boring city.\u201dThe city and its surrounding region, known as Chukyo, are filled with a wealth of attractions. These include historical castles, delicious food, scenic rail journeys, exciting theme parks, a thriving local bar scene and some of Japan\u2019s best museums.So why does it have a reputation amongst some Japanese residents for being dull? It reportedly all started in 2016, according to the, when Nagoya wound up last on a survey asking residents in eight cities to select which ones were the most appealing as travel destinations.In the years since, the city has proven the opposite is true, according to Nagoya residents Lena Yamaguchi and Elisabeth Llopis.In 2020, the pair founded, a local tour company that aims to share their passion for the city with visitors.\u201cTravelers can enjoy both traditional and modern in a compact size, and not only during the daylight, during which you can explore the many castles and temples and shrines of the area,\u201d says Llopis. At night, she suggests visiting the local izakaya bars \u201cto get a closer look at the local culture of the city.\u201dOne of Nagoya is not boring\u2019s street food or sake night walking tours is a great introduction to the city. For travelers who prefer to explore on their own, the city is easily navigated with a maps app and a transit smartcard \u2013 almost every type in Japan is interchangeable, but the local ones are called Manaca and Toica.Here\u2019s a closer look at what Nagoya has to offer first-time visitors.If you\u2019ve traveled by Shinkansen bullet train between Tokyo and Osaka, you\u2019ve passed through Nagoya, and might even remember the skyscraper district around its central railway station.Here you\u2019ll find all the modern Japan you\u2019d want, including a Takashimaya department store, a large BIC Camera outlet for electronics or the Hands (previously Tokyu Hands) craft and lifestyle store, a Uniqlo for Japan\u2019s latest fashions, as well as hotels for every budget and at every altitude.For an inexpensive Japanese \u201cbusiness hotel,\u201d there\u2019s the cheap and cheerful, scrupulously cleanchain, of which there are several within walking distance from the station.Watch planes take off in Japan \u2014 from an onsenNagoya\u2019s also a great place for a splurge, perhaps at thein one of the skyscrapers directly above the main railway station, which offers incredible views over the city and, for railway lovers, views high over the tracks of the Shinkansen and local lines to give that real-life train diorama feeling.If you don\u2019t want to splurge on the view from the Marriott, Starbucks fans have one to match in the outlet at the samecomplex.The three skyscrapers feature an interlinked set of restaurant floors on the 12th and 13th floors, with 75 restaurants for every tastebud and budget that are a great introductory or exploratory experience.Two of the skyscrapers have caf\u00e9s and restaurants with incredible panoramic views on the 51st or 52nd floors.Nagoya\u2019s local food, Nagoya-meshi, symbolizes the city\u2019s historical location both as a port and as part of the Tokaido road linking the capitals Kyoto and Edo (the former name for Tokyo).It\u2019s incredibly varied, including everything from chicken wings and Italian fusion spaghetti to more adventurous dishes like raw chicken sashimi.Nagoya-mesh\u2019s five characteristic styles are based on local red miso (hitsumabushi eel, miso katsu pork, miso nikomi udon noodles), the local kochin breed of chicken (tebasaki chicken wings and the toriwasa raw chicken sashimi), Italian fusion (teppan and ankake spaghetti), Asian fusion (like the kishimen, sugakiya and Taiwan-style ramen), and coffee shop menus (like ogura bean jam toast).One of the world's best Chinese restaurants is in TokyoLess panoramic than the towers\u2019 restaurant floors, but more local, are the smaller eateries clustered in the Esca underground shopping mall, hidden beneath the western side of the station.Heading just a few hundred meters from the station, especially on the western side, visitors quickly go from 50-plus-floor skyscrapers to regular neighborhoods with typical Japanese houses and low-rise apartments. A wander around this area gives you a real feel of how everyday people live, with small local shops and restaurants.Of all of Japan\u2019s beautiful castles, most are replicas, built in the traditional shape with modern materials after World War II.is one of the best examples of these, with its large main keeps rebuilt in concrete in the 1950s and now part of the museum complex that also includes the Nishinomaru Okura Museum, which opened in 2021. The city is in the process of rebuilding outer towers from original materials and continues to develop the castle precinct with cultural heritage and artifacts in mind.Only 12 castles across all of Japan remain standing in their original form, one of which isin the town of the same name in Nagoya\u2019s northern suburbs, nestled in the foothills of the Japanese Alps.In Japan's Aichi prefecture, geek paradise awaitsJust 45 minutes from Nagoya Station on the private (non-JR) Meitetsu railway, the area between Inuyama station and its castle has been sympathetically restored in recent years.The showpiece is the Honmachi-Dori shopping street, redesigned to reflect its history in the Showa era (1926-1989, the reign of the Showa emperor, known in the West by his birth name, Hirohito). Enjoy everything from traditional sweets to rental kimonos on your way to and from the castle.Younger visitors will also enjoy nearby, a relatively tame but very typical Japanese-style theme park, with rides and a water park section.Nagoya and its surrounding towns are also home to some of Japan\u2019s most interesting museums.Still in Inuyama, Meiji-mura is an open-air architectural museum on the shores of Lake Iruka that preserves buildings from the century of Japan\u2019s rapid modernization that started in the Meiji period (1867-1912). The most famous is the Frank Lloyd Wright-designed, but all are remarkable in their own way.Back in Nagoya, a few kilometers east of Nagoya Castle you\u2019ll find the, one of Japan\u2019s finest private museums, which holds several National Treasures of Japan thanks to its connection with the Tokugawa clan dynasty. It sits within the beautiful Tokugawa-en Gardens, restored in 2004, itself well worth a visit.Toyota Kaikan factory tour: Fascinating look at cars being made in JapanTo the south of the city center, under half an hour from the main station on the private (non-JR) Aonami Line (which wends its way through Nagoya\u2019s bustling port district), you\u2019ll find bothand thetrain museum on the reclaimed island of Kinjofuto.Legoland features roller coasters and dozens of other attractions, including Lego brick reproductions of many Japanese landmarks, as well as the Sea Life Nagoya aquarium within the hotel.The SCMaglev and Railway Park, meanwhile, is one of Japan\u2019s best railway museums, associated with the JR Central railway company that operated the original section of Shinkansen line west of Tokyo, as well as the one building the new 500 kilometers per hour superconducting maglev (magnetic levitation) Chuo Shinkansen line between Tokyo and Nagoya, which should open in 2027.The museum features everything from trial maglev trains all the way back to historical steam trains, and also offers simulators to try driving yourself. Visit on weekdays to avoid crowds, and get your name down for the simulator lottery early.If cars are your thing, then the, about 45 minutes east of Nagoya Station, features some 140 historical vehicles. Get there via the funky Linimo, a local maglev transit system that was built to bring visitors to the 2005 Expo outside of Nagoya. There\u2019s also the Toyota Commemorative Museum of Industry and Technology, a museum of manufacturing located a 20-minute walk north of Nagoya Station at the old headquarters of Toyota\u2019s predecessor company.Japan's long-awaited Ghibli Park is now openThe Expo Park is a beautifully landscaped space that also features the brand-new, of which Stage 1 is already finished. It\u2019s very much a park \u2014\u00a0no rides or attractions \u2014 but the first three sections are already built and look like great fun for Studio Ghibli fans.Meanwwhile, themuseum and craft center, at the home of the Noritake ceramics company, is just a brisk 15-minute walk north of Nagoya Station and offers a china painting experience. There\u2019s also a delightful French restaurant with a truly sublime afternoon tea service.And last, sports fans in the playing season must head out to the Vantelin Dome to watch the local baseball team, the Chunichi Dragons. Japanese baseball is a real trip even if you\u2019re not a huge fan of the sport, and the experience here is not to be missed."

        "text": "Written byThe British royal family's wardrobe choices have long been pored over by the public and media alike. The monarchy is an institution where impartiality, political neutrality and professionalism are to be maintained at all costs, even in clothing, lest hemlines, color palettes and even silhouettes become ciphers waiting to be cracked. Was Diana really seeking revenge when she wore an off-the-shoulderblack cocktail dress back in 1994? Did the late Queen Elizabeth II subtly show support for the European Union in aconveniently colored blue and yellow hat? Was Harry's admission of shopping in TK Maxx (the British equivalent to TJ Maxx) intended to make him more endearing to the masses?Catherine, Princess of Wales, brings royal elegance \u2014 and Zara earrings \u2014 to the BAFTAs red carpetBut one member of the royal family has so far succeeded in maintaining a low sartorial profile, even as her distinctive personal style has undergone a significant shift. King Charles' wife, Camilla \u2014 who on May 6 will becomethe 29th Queen Consort crowned at Westminster Abbey in London\u2014 has honed her public image in part using the soft power of fashion. From country casuals like puffer coats, knitted sweaters and linen summer skirts to more regal looks in velvet, suede and satin, Camilla's style evolution is a tale of two halves: Before royal engagements and after, though she has long loved fashion. (Scroll down to see her spotted front row at Chlo\u00e9's Paris Fashion Week show, 5 years before she married Charles).At the Ludlow racecourse in 1980 \u2014 the first occassion Princess Diana and Charles had been seen together in public \u2014 Camilla and Diana were matching in knee-high leather boots and structured outerwear.Even in 1984, the markings of Camilla's personal style were already visible. Pictured here with her first husband Andrew, son Tom and daughter Laura, Camilla's three-strand pearl necklace, structured blazer and off-center beret are pieces she has gone on to wear again and again.On the grounds of her country home in Wiltshire, south west England in 1992, the Queen consort looked cozy and comfortable in vibrant knit pullovers.During the '80s and '90s, matching skirt suits \u2014 complete with powerful shoulder padding \u2014 were a mainstay in Camilla's wardrobe. In 1992, while attending a polo match at Smith's Lawn in Windsor, Camilla opted for a gray and fuchsia combination.A far cry from her recent regal looks, Camilla could once be seen in a typical off-duty '90s uniform: Black puffer jacket and high-waisted blue jeans.Similary, during the summer of 1993 Camilla's personal style was remarkably relatable. Like this white tank top and linen maxi skirt. Here, she's photographed outside with her first husband, Andrew.For her mother's funeral on June 6 1994, Camilla wore an elegant black skirt suit with gold detailing, a navy shirt and a black beret.At a party at The Ritz in London in 1995, Camilla donned one of her favorite jewelry pieces: A three strand pearl necklace completed by a central aquamarine stone, paired with an off-the-shoulder black cocktail dress.Long before it was expected that Camilla publicly support British creative exports, she was seen cheering on Stella McCartney during her Fall-Winter 2000 show for Chlo\u00e9 at Paris Fashion Week. Perched on her knee was a black leather Chlo\u00e9 Epi crossbody bag, with a gold chain strap and clasp.At a charity fashion gala hosted by Vogue for Macmillan Cancer Relief in 2001 at Waddesdon Manor, Buckinghamshire, Camilla arrived in a bold jacquard gown in an elegant watercolor print.In 2003, while attending yet another fashion event (this time, the Prince's Trust \"Fashion Rocks\" concert at Royal Albert Hall) Camilla is photographed meeting industry legend Dontella Versace. She wore her trusty diamond serpentine necklace once again.At her wedding to Charles in 2005, Camilla wore two outfits. The first was a white silk coat and chiffon dress by Robinson Valentine finished with a feather and lace trimmed hat by Philip Treacy.The second look for the couple's blessing featured a baby blue silk dress, also by Robinson Valentine, and a second Philip Treacy hat with gold-leaf covered feathers. The gold detailing on Camilla's coat was hand-embroidered.Velvet quickly became a favorite fabric for Camilla, shown here in a deep navy off-the-shoulder gown she wore to a gala at the Museum of Modern Art in New York in 2005. Her aquamarine and pearl choker is another staple.In this look from 2006, Camilla is bridging her two style identities with a country casual tartan fitted jacket (paired with a matching forest green dress) and accessorized with one her favorite styles of necklace.Camilla opts for another velvet evening gown in 2008 when attending \"The Other Boleyn Girl\" Royal Film Premiere in London.Camilla has even turned to more alternative designers in her time. At the premiere of \"Alice in Wonderland\" (2010) in London, she opted for an iridescent sculptural Vivienne Westwood gown.At the Royal Courts of Justice in 2010, Camilla met British designer Lulu Guinness. Guinness designed the black satin Jane bag worn by Camilla that evening. It featured a 1st Class stamp design embroidered in colorful sequins.At the Art Worker's Guild in 2015 in London, Camilla opted for a chic tartan dresscoat finished with a crushed velvet collar and pockets.Heavy, luxurious fabrics are on a near-constant rotation in Camilla's wardrobe, demonstrated here at the Man Booker Prize award ceremony in 2016, with this paneled suede blouse in maroon.Dressed in an icy blue Bruce Oldfield dresscoat and a matching pillbox hat, Camilla's outfit (worn to the official commissioning ceremony of a new aircraft carrier in Portsmouth) made headlines for its sleek appearance.In recent years, Camilla has found her rhythm with sleek coat dresses in dark shades with small design twists \u2014 such as this mandarin collared look worn in 2022.During a visit to Colchester Castle in March, 2023, Camilla was spotted in a chic white dress coat. Her commitment to cosiness is always present, however, demonstrated here with her wide-brim, fur-trimmed hat."

        "text": "Air traffic control in the United States is understaffed by about 3,000 positions, Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg told CNN on Friday, as hiring to fill some of that gap opened.The Federal Aviation Administration ATC workforce currently numbers about 11,500 controllers, but \u201cthe optimal number is closer to about 14,500,\u201d the secretary said on CNN News Central. The numbers are similar to the agency\u2019s assessment this spring that about one in five controller positions nationwide are vacant.\u201cWe have thousands of controllers in training right now but also a number who are eligible to retire,\u201d Buttigieg said.He spoke as the agency began hiring on Friday \u2013 targeting 1,500 new entry-level air traffic controllers this year \u2013 and published an annual report on the agency\u2019s ATC workforce.FAA creates safety review panel after string of close calls at US airportsThat report showed the agency hired 1,026 controllers last year, just shy of its targets, acting FAA administrator Billy Nolen told Congress in a letter. The FAA also experienced more controllers leaving the job last year than it had planned, and is further short-staffed because the coronavirus pandemic \u201chas resulted in delayed certification for most existing developmental controllers.\u201dRecently, Nolen told reporters that the agency\u2019s planned 3,300 hires in the next two years will mostly replace those who are retiring. About 500 of those hires will hold positions that are currently empty.Earlier this spring, the FAA asked airlines to dial back flights this summer in the New York metropolitan area, where a key radar facility is only 54 percent staffed. Airlines flying their planned summer schedules would cause a spike in delays due to the shortage, the FAA predicted.But Buttigieg argued that most delays travelers experience are not the cause of air traffic controller short-staffing.\u201cController availability is not the cause of most cancelations and delays that we see,\u201d he said in the CNN interview. \u201cThe (staffing) gaps that we\u2019ve seen have built up over years. This is nothing that we can\u2019t prepare for going into this summer. But this is part of why we\u2019re working so hard to train new air traffic controllers.\u201dNolen wrote in a letter to Congress that \u201cabout 5 percent of delay minutes can be attributed to FAA staff shortages.\u201d"

        "link": "https://edition.cnn.com/style/article/ramata-toulaye-sy-interview-banel-and-adama-cannes-2023-spc-intl/index.html",
        "text": "Written byWhen the lineup for the Cannes Film Festival was announced on April 13, it featured plenty of familiar names: Wes Anderson, Martin Scorsese and Todd Haynes; Cannes stalwarts including Hirokazu Kore-eda, Ken Loach and Nuri Bilge Ceylan. Towards the end of the list was Ramata-Toulaye Sy -- not yet a familiar name, but that could be about to change.A surprise addition to the official selection, French Senegalese director Sy has joined a small club of filmmakers to compete for the Palme d'Or -- the festival's top prize -- with their first feature. (The last time this happened was in 2019, when Mati Diop and LadjLy -- both with connections to Africa -- won second and third prizes respectively.)As debuts go, it's a daunting one. Few places possess a more glaring spotlight than Cannes, and premiering a movie there is a trial by fire that tests the nerves of even the most experienced filmmakers. (There's a reason reviews are embargoed until after actors and directors have walked the red carpet.) For Sy, who has only previously attended the festival as a student, it's a leap into the big leagues. But anyone who's watched her short film \"Astel\" will have seen she possesses talent in abundance.Her feature film \"Banel & Adama\" features a young couple (played by Khady Mane and Mamadou Diallo) at odds with their community in northern Senegal, the region where Sy's parents were born. Cast with non-professional actors who perform in local language Pulaar, the director said the film draws on her dual nationality and the storytelling traditions of both Europe and Africa, combining \"everything I know, everything I am and everything that I love.\"Ahead of the film's premiere later this month, she spoke on a video call to discuss her festival debut, streaming versus cinemas and the state of African filmmaking.Ramata-Toulaye Sy, pictured at The Red Sea International Film Festival in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, December 2021.Sy: The film has been wrapped for a month and a half. We sent a version to Cannes which was not completely finished -- there was still color grading to do, a bit of mixing. As soon as they saw it, they called us and said they wanted the film for Un Certain Regard (a separate competition, where new voices are more common). I was really happy because it's a great selection for a first-time feature. But the day before the press release, Christian Jeune (Cannes deputy general delegate) called me at midnight and announced that the film will be in competition. It was a big surprise for me and all the team.I studied at La F\u00e9mis -- a film school in France -- in the screenplay department and it was my end-of-studies screenplay in 2014 to 2015. Then it sat in a drawer for a long time because I wasn't ready to direct yet and I was more interested in (screen)writing. I think I needed time to find my voice and navigate the film industry. I started (directing) with a short film, \"Astel,\" in 2020 and then straight into a feature film in 2022.It's a tragedy. At first, \"Banel & Adama'' feels like a classic love story; Banel and Adama are a happily married couple living in a remote village in the region of Fouta (northern Senegal). They are fiercely in love. But this love affair is going to bring chaos in the village, because in their community there is no room for passion. Little by little, we realize that this love story focuses more on Banel than Adama -- it turns into the story of a woman trying to fulfill herself.Even though I was born and raised in France, I have a deep bond with Africa, and the (West African) Fulani culture and traditions. For me, it is important to tell stories that take place in Africa because this continent has to be seen and needs to be recognized more than it does today, with more universal and different stories -- not just stories about how poor the continent is, the war, the terrorism. For me, doing my first feature in Senegal is like a political gesture.Having both these nationalities has helped me find my way and has helped me to form my worldview. With \"Banel & Adama,\" I really confront my double identity. It's a film with several genres: storytelling with griots -- African tales -- but also Greek and European tragedy, Afro-American magical realism and poetry.We had the same casting director (as \"Astel,\" Iman Djionne) who started casting five months before shooting. I really needed people who have the physiognomy of the Fulani and who speak this language. We did several castings in several cities and villages.Banel was the most complicated character to find. We found her very, very late and it was I who found (Khady Mane) by chance when I was walking in the street. The first thing I saw were her eyes. Banel is quite a mythical and mystical character. In (Khady's) eyes, there was something quite mysterious -- a certain madness. Maybe it's me imagining, because in real life Khady is a very shy person. But those eyes attracted me, so I asked her to audition the next day.Sy said that Barry Jenkins' \"Moonlight\" (pictured), Benh Zeitlin's \"Beasts of the Southern Wild\" and the films of Ingmar Bergman were among the inspirations for \"Banel & Adama.\" She showed her lead, Khady Mane, Bruno Nuytten's \"Camille Claudel\" and Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut's \"The Story of Ad\u00e8le H\" to study the work of actor Isabelle Adjani.It's not me who decides, but rather the international sellers. Of course it's better to see films at the cinema. Nothing can be more beautiful than the experience of watching on a big screen in a dark room surrounded by strangers. But when you don't have access, it's more important to see them anyway. Today, a cinema ticket in France is around \u20ac15 ($16.50) -- it's super expensive. There are plenty of families who can't afford that. In Africa, people have more access on streaming platforms than cinemas. The most important thing is that people see the films.The Senegalese film scene was very active between the 70s and 90s and then it began to disappear as cinemas started to disappear. Gradually, there were very few screens left. Since the 2010s cinemas have returned. Canal Olympia has opened one movie theater with one screen in Dakar, Cinema Ousmane Semb\u00e8ne followed, and Path\u00e9 recently opened a cinema with seven screens. I think the golden age of Senegalese cinema is coming back into force -- and this time with more women. I'm very happy to be part of it.French producer and actor Omar Sy and French director Mathieu Vadepied attend the Senegalese premiere of their film \"Tirailleurs\" in Dakar, December 2022. The Path\u00e9 cinema is one of a number of recent new venues in the capital.Of course! Path\u00e9 Afrique is our African distributor. We'll have an event in their brand-new venue in Dakar.I hope so. It is going to be more difficult because of the infrastructure that we'd have to bring over there, like projectors and screens. But yes.The projection in the Grand Theatre Lumi\u00e8re. I'm scared and I'm very excited. Two thousand people in the room, with the press, with the jury. That's going to be something -- it makes you dream.Thibault Lacombe contributed to this article."

Gone were the requests for attendees to wear grand robes or ceremonial attire in favor of a more relaxed, pared down look.Members of the royal family, however, arrived in traditional regalia. The Prince of Wales wore a ceremonial dress uniform of the Welsh guards, while the Princess of Wales looked resplendent in official robes \u2014 worn over an Alexander McQueen ivory silk crepe dress peppered with silver bullion embroidered roses, thistles, daffodils and shamrock motifs symbolizing the different nations of the United Kingdom.Prince William, Catherine, Princess of Wales, and their children Princess Charlottte and Prince Louis arrive at the Coronation of King Charles III and Queen Camilla.According to CNN royal experts Max Foster and Lauren Moorhouse, Kate was also wearing a pair of drop-pearl earrings set in diamonds, once belonging to Princess Diana, as well as a lavish silver bullion laurel-shaped headpiece by Jess Collett and Alexander McQueen.The esteemed British designer is a fan favorite of the Wales'. Sarah Burton, the creative director of Alexander McQueen since 2010, custom created Kate's striking wedding dress in 2011.

Built to link several industrial towns along the narrow, twisting valley of the Wupper river, the suspended monorail was completed in 1901 and was instrumental in the growth of the towns, which eventually merged to become the city of Wuppertal in 1929.It might look unusual to visitors, but to the people of Wuppertal it\u2019s the backbone of the city\u2019s transit network, gliding up to 40 feet above congested streets to offer fast, direct journeys along an eight-mile route.The single rails carrying the trains are supported by a series of 486 steel portals weighing almost 20,000 tonnes in total. More than 80,000 people a day are transported by 31 modern articulated cars traveling at up to 37 mph (60 kph). A replica of the vintage Kaiserwagen (Emperor\u2019s Car) used by Kaiser Wilhelm II in 1900 also operates on special occasions but is currently being restored; it\u2019s hoped that it will return to service by spring 2024.The German city with an incredible upside down railwayCurrent holder of the record for the world\u2019s, Switzerland\u2019sopened in December 2017 and has become a global tourist attraction in its own right.The unique cars with their rotating \u201cbarrels\u201d allow passengers to stay level and travel serenely up the mountain at gradients of up to 110%. On a route of just over one mile (1.74 kilometers), the railway climbs almost 2,450 feet (744 meters) from the valley station in just five minutes.Stoosbahn is far more than just a joyride though \u2013 it\u2019s a vital lifeline for the car-free village of Stoos, which sits high on a mountain near the town of Schwyz, south of Z\u00fcrich. Each car is fitted with three passenger \u201cbarrels\u201d plus a further section for freight. Every year, up to 10,000 tonnes of freight is carried \u2013 essential supplies going up the hill to restaurants and hotels, garbage and recycling traveling back down. Up to 1,500 passengers an hour, plus their skis or snowboards, can also be carried \u2013 a 50% increase over the previous funicular railway.Riding the Stoosbahn is a unique experience, even if you\u2019re a connoisseur of mountain railways. The smooth transition from level to almost vertical happens very quickly and the view from the rotating cabins is exceptional. You\u2019d have to be very jaded not to be impressed with such an astonishing piece of railway engineering.High speed trains are racing across the world. But not in AmericaPier railways were an attraction at several British seaside resorts in the 19th century, the most famous being the mile-long trip to the tip ofon the country\u2019s east coast \u2013 which you can still experience today. Most were built for pleasure, usually to save visitors a long walk back to shore.Hythe Pier Railway, on the south coast of England, has always been a little different though; it provides a unique link between dry land and the, which has shuttled to and fro across Southampton Water since the Middle Ages.The current pier opened in 1881 and a quirky 2,100-foot railway was added in 1909. It is the oldest continuously operating pier railway in the world. Wagons were initially propelled by hand but in 1922 a new narrow gauge electric railway replaced the original track. Two Army surplus electric locomotives, originally built to work in a World War I mustard gas factory, have worked the trains ever since.The bizarre-looking locomotives continue to pull (or push) their weatherbeaten little coaches along the pier to meet every ferry to and from Southampton Town Quay, despite. Visit it while you still can.Monorails have been around for more than a century and examples can be found all over the world, but they\u2019ve never quite fulfilled the futuristic promises of their early promoters. That said, there are a few places where the unique qualities offered by monorails are ideally suited to their environment.Chongqing in China is home to the world\u2019s longest and one of its busiest monorail system, carrying millions of passengers a year on two high-capacity \u201cstraddle beam\u201d lines totaling 61 miles in length. At just over 34 miles, Line 3 is also the world\u2019s longest single monorail line with an annual ridership of around 250 million. Opened between 2005 and 2016, the two lines have 70 stations with a mix of underground and elevated sections. Famously, one section of Line 2 passes through the heart of a high-rise apartment block.The city\u2019s unique topography, with extreme differences in altitude between its densely populated mountain plateaus and the Yangtze and Jialing river valleys forced Chongqing\u2019s transit authorities to seek an alternative to conventional metro trains. Monorail\u2019s ability to negotiate steep climbs and tight curves made it the ideal solution when this megacity needed to transform its public transit system.Is it a train? Or is it a bus? Neither, it\u2019s a Ferrobus \u2013 a unique form of improvised transport found across mountainous regions of South America.Combining old road bus bodies with rail wheels, these wobbly-looking contraptions are a lifeline for remote mountain villages lacking official road access. Using otherwise abandoned rail lines \u2013 often built in the 19th and early 20th century to exploit mineral deposits \u2013 Ferrobus routes can be found in Chile, Bolivia and Colombia, climbing high into the Andes.Ferrobus trips are increasingly popular with tourists seeking an unforgettable experience, and likely wanting to avoid uncomfortable and often dangerous road journeys. Chile\u2019s Gondola Carril from Los Andes to Rio Blanco, north of Santiago, operates purely for tourists, but others provide regular, if somewhat unpredictable, transport for locals and tourists alike.Bolivia is arguably the epicenter of the Ferrobus world, with at least three routes, although there\u2019s a constant risk of derailments, not to mention disruption from floods, rockfalls and extreme weather.Riding a Ferrobus requires patience and stamina, but you\u2019re guaranteed to return with some hair-raising stories to tell your friends.Europe's most underrated scenic railwaysGotta catch \u2018em all? Here\u2019s one that will appeal to fans of Pok\u00e9mon and trains. An otherwise ordinary Japanese local train has been dressed up to resemble the all-conquering franchise\u2019s most famous character \u2013 Pikachu.The bright yellow signature color dominates inside and out, with Pikachu motifs covering everything from floor to walls and curtains. One car has seating, while the second car has been fitted out as a fabulous mobile playroom for junior Pok\u00e9mon trainers. During the two-hour trip from Ichinoseki to Kesennuma in the T\u00f5hoku Region, children can play, nap and socialize with giant plush Pikachus or even pretend to drive the train.Introduced in 2017 to put a smile on local faces after the devastating earthquake and tsunami of 2011, which also prompted the reactor meltdown in the neighboring Fukushima region,is one of severaloperated by railway company JR East. Ranging from traditional steam trains to luxurious, exotically decorated expresses between cities and resorts, they\u2019re part of an incredibly rich and vibrant railway culture that attracts visitors from all over the world to Japan.Which city is home to mainland Europe\u2019s oldest underground railway? Paris? Berlin? Vienna? In fact, it\u2019s the Hungarian capital Budapest, where line M1 has been operating since May 1896.In the late-19th and early 20th centuries Hungary \u2013 then part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire - was a vigorous pioneer of new railway technology. This short (2.3-mile) line under Andr\u00e1ssy Avenue on the Pest side of the Danube river was only the third underground electric railway in the world, opening shortly after similar lines in London and Liverpool, England.Like London\u2019s tiny \u201ctube trains\u201d of the same era, the first tunnels in Budapest were built to an unusually small profile and the effects of that decision can still be encountered today on what the locals call \u201ca kisf\u00f6ldalatti,\u201d or \u201cthe small underground.\u201d The original trains, more akin to freight cars fitted with wooden shelters, were replaced in 1973 when line M1 was rebuilt and extended, but a ride on M1 is still a very different experience from the city\u2019s later metro lines with their wide-bodied trains and airy stations.Thousand of people a day squeeze into the little yellow trains \u2013 a much higher ridership than when it was completed. But with its low platforms and short, angular trains, it\u2019s very different to the usual city metro experience.Over the last two decades, China\u2019s rail industry has become the largest and most varied in the world, helped by the astonishing expansion of the country\u2019s high-speed network and global exports.But there\u2019s far more to China than sleek high-speed trains and megacity subways; the size and diversity of this enormous nation demands ingenious solutions to serve areas conventional trains can\u2019t reach.A unique example is the world\u2019s first hanging monorail with a glass floor, now running in Sichuan Province. Theconnects four stations at busy tourist spots over a seven-mile (11.5 kilometer) route in the city of Chengdu.Unusually, the lightweight car bodies are constructed from carbon fiber and composite foam material. They are powered by rechargeable batteries with electricity from renewable sources. But the panoramic windows and transparent floor are their most spectacular features, allowing up to 120 passengers per trip a 270-degree view combining clean, efficient and quiet transport with a memorable sightseeing trip.10 new train journeys for 2023Imagine a vehicle that can pick you up outside your home, drive to the nearest railway line, convert itself into a train and then switch back to drop you in the center of a nearby town. It may sound like a story from \u201cThomas the Tank Engine,\u201d but that exactly what Japan\u2019sbuses have been doing since they launched on Christmas Day 2021.The buses, carrying around 20 passengers per trip, run a 30-mile route between the town of Kaiyo in Tokushima and the city of Muroto, Kochi Prefecture. Six miles of the route are along a rural railway line, with the rest in bus mode.With a capacity of 23, including passengers and crew, the DMV is a diesel-powered bus fitted with a set of retractable rail wheels which can be deployed in about 15 seconds. Lighter than a traditional train, the DMV also consumes less fuel and is cheaper to maintain.Billed as \u201cthe world\u2019s first operational dual-mode vehicle,\u201d it is actually the latest in a long series of similar experiments to improve rural rail services and reduce their costs. As far back as the 1930s, road buses were converted into railcars in Ireland and similar vehicles to the DMV were tested in England in the 1930s and West Germany in the 1950s.Tokushima prefectural government hopes the DMV buses will become a tourist draw in their own right. It also believes that the vehicles could also be useful for reaching isolated communities in the event of natural disasters such as earthquakes, which can leave sections of roads or railway lines unusable.Not far from the wonderful city of Sydney is a railway experience unlike anything else in the world. Situated in the heart of the Blue Mountains, theis another contender for the title of the world\u2019s steepest railway. But, unlike Switzerland\u2019s Stoosbahn, this railway delivers a hair-raising descent down sandstone cliffs and through epic rock formations and tunnels perched over a stunning rainforest landscape.Glass-roofed cars take up to 84 visitors per trip down the 52-degree (128%) incline, although if you\u2019re feeling brave you can adjust the angle of your seat to the \u201cCliffhanger\u201d position at 64 degrees. Fortunately, there\u2019s also a \u201cLaidback\u201d option for the less adventurous.The rope-hauled railway dates back to the late-1800s when it was part of the Katoomba mining tramways, but since 1945 the remaining line has been a thrilling tourist attraction. More than 25 million people have braved the trip since it opened and the latest generation of cars feature panoramic roofs, allowing visitors to get an even better view of the forest canopy and rock formations."

        "text": "Canada and China have become embroiled in a fresh diplomatic row after Ottawa summonedto respond to allegations that Beijing tried to intimidate a Canadian politician and interfere in its elections.Canadian Foreign Affairs Minister M\u00e9lanie Joly announced the summoning of the ambassador Thursday, adding that Canada was considering taking retaliatory action over the allegations, which China vigorously denies.\u201cAll options are on the table,\u201d Joly said \u2013 including diplomatic expulsions.Joly\u2019s comments to members of parliament came during a heated exchange with opposition lawmaker Michael Chong \u2013 the alleged target of the intimidation, who has in recent days heavily criticized Prime Minister Justin Trudeau\u2019s government for what he sees as their slow response to the allegations.The news follows revelations, first reported by the Globe and Mail newspaper, that the Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS) found an accredited Chinese diplomat in the country had targeted Chong and his relatives in China following his criticisms of Beijing\u2019s treatment of its Uyghur minorities.The intelligence service also said that Beijing had tried to sway the outcome of Canada\u2019s federal elections in 2019 and 2021.China on Thursday insisted the claims were \u201ctotally groundless,\u201d accused the Canadian media and politicians of \u201cspreading disinformation,\u201d and warned Canada against going \u201cfurther down the wrong and dangerous path.\u201dDuring the summons, China\u2019s Ambassador to Canada, Cong Peiwu \u201cprotested strongly\u201d against the \u201cthreat to expel the relevant Chinese diplomatic and consular personnel based on rumors of so-called \u2018China interference\u2019 hyped up by some Canadian politicians and media,\u201d according to a statement from the Chinese embassy.\u201cChina\u2019s diplomatic and consular officials\u2019 normal performance (daily activities) must not be smeared, and China\u2019s sovereignty, security, and development interests must not be violated,\u201d Cong said.He told Canadian officials at the meeting \u201cto immediately stop this self-directed political farce\u201d and warned that China would \u201cplay along every step of the way until the end\u201d should the Canadian side continue to \u201cmake provocations.\u201dChina\u2019s Consulate-General in Toronto meanwhile expressed \u201cstrong dissatisfaction\u201d and \u201cfirm opposition\u201d to the summoning of the ambassador, and insisted its officers had never engaged in activities \u201cinconsistent with their official capacities.\u201d\u201cThe claim has no factual basis and is totally groundless,\u201d the Consulate-General said in a statement.It accused some Canadian media and politicians of \u201cspreading disinformation with intent to damage the reputation and image of the Chinese Consulate-General\u201d and \u201cmaliciously disrupt normal exchange and cooperation between the two sides.\u201dAllegations of Chinese efforts to interfere in Canadian politics have been swirling for weeks, but reached a tipping point this week following the revelations by the Globe and Mail.According to the report, Chinese operatives tried to swing some local parliamentary races during national elections held in 2019 and 2021. However, the agency stopped short of alleging that China succeeded or in any way changed the outcome of those elections.The allegations also include claims that an accredited Chinese diplomat was involved in a plot to intimidate Chong in 2021 after he sponsored a motion in Canada\u2019s parliament to condemn China\u2019s treatment of Uyghur minorities, labeling their treatment by China genocide.Chong has described his apparent targeting as disturbing, but has also said it it not surprising \u2013 either for him or Canada\u2019s large Chinese diaspora \u2013 and has focused much of his criticism on the Canadian government\u2019s response, which he says has been too slow to act.In her comments to parliamentarians on Thursday, Joly said Canada\u2019s government needed to carefully weigh how China might react.China would \u201cof course\u201d take action against Canada\u2019s \u201ceconomic interest, consumer interest and also diplomatic interests,\u201d Joly said, adding that, \u201cI know that we are under pressure to go fast, (but) we need to make sure as well that we protect our democracy.\u201dRelations between Ottawa and Beijing have been tense in recent years.In one especially high-profile example, two Canadians \u2013 former diplomat Michael Kovrig and businessman Michael Spavor \u2013 were detained by China for nearly three years.Their arrest on espionage charges in late 2018 came shortly after Canada arrested Chinese businesswoman and Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou on a US warrant related to the company\u2019s business dealings in Iran.Beijing repeatedly denied that their cases were a political retaliation, but the two men were released on the same day Meng was allowed by Canada to return to China.Chong responded to Joly\u2019s remarks by demanding Canada expel the diplomat regardless of any possible blowback from China.\u201cIf we do not take that course of action, minister, we are basically putting up a giant billboard for all the authoritarian states around the world that says we are open for foreign interference threat activities on Canadian soil targeting Canadian citizens and you can conduct these activities with zero consequences \u2013 and that\u2019s why this individual needs to be sent packing,\u201d Chong said.Chong and others say questions remain as to why the Trudeau government did not act sooner to acknowledge and act on the intelligence.\u201cIt\u2019s astounding that the government hasn\u2019t taken action to expel this individual,\u201d Chong told a press briefing in Ottawa Tuesday.\u201cAnd for the government of Canada to continue to accredit this individual and allow this individual to remain in Canada is a complete abdication of responsibility,\u201d he added.Critics have also questioned why Chong and other politicians were not forewarned of the intelligence suggesting he had been targeted.While Trudeau was briefed on some of the intelligence agency\u2019s findings, he said Tuesday at a press briefing that he had not been briefed specifically on the alleged targeting of Chong.Trudeau said he first heard this when it was reported in the media, as the spy agency had felt the intelligence was not significant enough to notify either the prime minister\u2019s office or Chong himself.Trudeau said that reasoning was a mistake.\u201cWe\u2019re making it very, very clear to CSIS and our intelligence officials that when there are concerns that talk specifically about any MP, or about their family, those need to be elevated, even if CSIS doesn\u2019t feel that it\u2019s a sufficient level of concern for them to take more direct action,\u201d Trudeau said.Chong, a member of the opposition conservative party, has criticized Trudeau\u2019s explanation as unacceptable, saying he and others in the Chinese community deserve to know if they are at risk.\u201cI have not spoken to my family in China in years, I like many, many Canadians across the country whose family lives in authoritarian states have had to face the difficult dilemma of how to protect the family in these authoritarian states,\u201d Chong said, adding that the Chinese diplomat who allegedly targeted him still lives and works in Canada and enjoys diplomatic immunity.Chong and other opposition party politicians are not the only ones demanding a tough response from Ottawa.Among the voices calling for retaliation is Dennis Molinaro, a former national security adviser and now a professor of legal studies at Ontario Tech University.\u201c(Canada) really has to be following the American model in terms of more aggressively pursuing action against China when China is engaged in these actions that are direct threats to Canadian sovereignty,\u201d he told CNN in a telephone interview Wednesday.\u201cI think the Canadian public is aware of that now and recognizes that and supports a lot tougher action in terms of Canada protecting itself from these kinds of threats,\u201d he added."

        "text": "Ecuador was known as the \u201cisla de paz\u201d \u2013 an island of peace \u2013 in the 1980s, when compared to its neighbors Colombia and Peru, some of the world\u2019s biggest producers of cocaine.But a deadlyhas upended that reputation in the past few years, as rights groups say the Andean nation has clocked some of the highest homicide rates in the region.In April alone, the country has seen a, explosions in the port city of, and the slaying of at least nine people during an armed attack on a fishing port.Civilians are finding themselves caught between criminal groups battling for control of the cocaine supply chain, which passes through Ecuador, according to Glaeldys Gonz\u00e1lez, an expert on organized crime at the International Crisis Group.And Ecuadorian authorities have struggled to tackle this public security crisis \u201cefficiently because it is mired in (a) political crisis,\u201d Gonz\u00e1lez says.Ecuador\u2019s President Guillermo Lasso is at the center of this storm, and his popularity has tanked amid widespread discontent with spiraling crime rates.\u201cLasso has not delivered\u201d on campaign promises of lower taxes and more foreign direct investment, said Luis Ortiz, an Ecuadorian political analyst and development consultant. Nor has he been able to convey a successful strategy to stop the violence, he added.Lasso faces an impeachment vote in the next few weeks over accusations of embezzlement before he took office by opposition legislators \u2013 allegations Lasso denies.It was not always so hard for the self-made millionaire, who ran on a platform of liberal values before coming into power in 2021, promising more foreign direct investment and encouragement of entrepreneurship. He was lauded for a successful Covid-19 vaccination drive at the start of his term, enjoying high approval ratings at the time.It went downhill soon after.Lasso survived an impeachment attempt amid weeks-long protests over rising fuel and food prices last year, and his name emerged in the \u201cPandora Papers,\u201d a 2021 expose ofand offshore dealings of dozens of heads of state and public officials.Ecuadoran law prohibits public servants from holding assets in tax havens. Lasso told Ecuador\u2019s legislative commission investigating him that he had not evaded taxes and that his tax trajectory was legally supported. The investigation was later closedcomptroller\u2019s office.But opposition lawmakers have renewed their efforts to impeach him, and the President\u2019s popular support is evaporating as crime skyrockets.The dramatic rise in crime that has fueled anger at his government is a trend that predated his presidency. Before Lasso took office, Ecuador had already become afor cocaine due to its location between Peru and Colombia, and the dollarization of its economy in 2000 made it an easy location to launder money, say analysts.But the controls needed to stop organized crime were kneecapped by austerity measures put in place by his predecessor, Lenin Moreno, that led to massive layoffs in the public sector and budget cuts, Ortiz told CNN.\u201cThe judicial system, the institution that oversees bank transfers and bank transactions \u2013 they don\u2019t even have money to make photocopies, much less track transactions that could potentially be linked to organized crime,\u201d he said.Allegations of corruption have also marred the courts and police, with the US withdrawing visas fromof Ecuadorian state security forces, alleged to be linked to drug trafficking, and several judges and lawyers.Lasso, who has a weak mandate in Congress and has struggled to build coalitions, has implemented several states of emergencies to tamp the bloodletting in the country, which has seen hundreds killed in brutal prison riots between rival gangs, to very little success, say critics.His approach has become more haphazard following the second impeachment attempt. Last week, he declared organized criminal groups as terrorists, a move that empowered the military in pursuing gangs \u2013 despite allegations of corruption that cloud the security forces.His embrace of his predecessor\u2019s austerity package has seen Lasso incentivize the private sector to step in on security issues, which Ortiz described as being a disaster.This includes Lasso\u2019s recent authorization of civilians to use, a move which saw \u201cprivate security companies (becoming) the first to raise their hand to say: \u2018hey, no way, what we are seeing right now is criminals are more equipped than police,\u2019\u201d Ortiz said.The mood further soured against Lasso this year when Ecuadorian media accused the president\u2019s brother-in-law Danilo Carrera of corruption, including a cash for executive positions scheme and fake energy contracts.Ecuadorian prosecutors had opened an investigation into the fake energy contracts in January.Following the report, Lasso asked prosecutors to investigate Carrera over his business and personal relationship with Ruben Cherres \u2013 whom authorities sought to arrest but was found murdered in. Lasso has rejected the existence of a corruption structure or network in his government.CNN has reached out to Carrera for comment.In a letter sent to local media in January, Carrera\u2019s lawyers rejected allegations that he was the leader of a corruption scheme in public companies. He also denied claims that he had obtained illegitimate benefits for himself or third parties.The center-right leader is one of the few friends Washington has in the region, but even that relationship may be fraying.While several US senators have, and Secretary of State Antony Blinken noted the US\u2019s strong partnership with the country during a 2021 visit. But in April, a group of eight US Congressmembersto US President Joe Biden urging him to \u201cre-evaluate our government\u2019s close relations with the Lasso government\u201d and look into the corruption allegations surrounding Lasso and his associates.Lasso would be replaced by Vice President Alfredo Borrero if impeached, but he suggested to thein April that it won\u2019t get that far, saying he would invoke a constitutional clause that would force elections for his role and congress.The gambit would see Lasso rule by presidential decree and hold elections in six months\u2019 time, and critics can see why Lasso might be tempted to opt for the nuclear option.\u201cIf the opposition\u2019s got the 92 votes that they need to get rid of him, he\u2019s going to press that button and give himself six months to find a way out,\u201d said Guillaume Long, a former foreign minister for Ecuador who is now a senior policy analyst at the Center for Economic and Policy Research.If early elections are triggered, the 67-year-old Lasso has said he will run again despite losing a lot of political capital. In February, opposition parties won key mayoral positions in Quito and Guayaquil and a Lasso-backed referendum on eight reforms, including allowing the extradition of criminals,.As the clock runs on Lasso\u2019s next move, violence and economic insecurity are leading more Ecuadorians to leave the country, with statistics showingmaking their way north through the treacherous Darien Gap this year."

Her ivory, silver and gold embroidered Coronation dress was created by British designer Bruce Oldfield, a house that celebrates its 50th anniversary this year and with whom Camilla has a longstanding relationship.Queen Camilla arriving in the Diamond Jubilee Coach wearing her ermine Robe of State.Simple, tailored and cut from Peau de Soie, a silk with a dull lustre finish, the fabric was woven by Stephen Walters in Suffolk, England.The dress featured Oldfield's signature paneling, a short train and fine yet intricate embroidery of \" daisy chains, forget-me-nots, celandine and scarlet pimpernel, representing the King and Queen Consorts affection for nature and the British countryside,\"  said the Palace in a statement.\"I am honored to have been asked to design such an historic gown for Her Majesty. This really is the most important commission of my life. Very exciting and very special,\" Oldfield told Women's Wear Daily.\"An interesting element of the gown is that it reflects a more fluid and modern\u202frepresentation of the king and the\u202fqueen consort's affection for nature and the British countryside.\"Bruce Oldfield OBE was born in London to an Irish mother and a Jamaican father but spent the first 13 years of his life in the north of England with his foster mother Violet Masters, a seamstress who began his love of sewing.Bruce Oldfield has a longstanding relationship with the royal family, particularly Camilla.In September 1973, after studying at Central Saint Martin's fashion school in London, Oldfield began designing for the Henri Bendel department store in New York, followed by a stint in Paris before creating his own label and then, some years later in 1984, opening his first shop in London.A long-time favorite of celebrities such as Bianca Jagger and Charlotte Rampling, Oldfield's connections with the royal family go back to his relationship with Princess Diana which began in 1981. Oldfield designed many of her iconic gowns in the 1980s and his sharp suiting and flattering dresses from the time have found favor with a new audience, with stars such as Taylor Swift and Rihanna having been seen in his vintage pieces.Bruce Oldfield and Camilla at Buckingham Palace in honour of children's charity, May 12, 2016.Now working out of a studio on the aptly named Prince of Wales Drive in Battersea, south London, Oldfield, who is 72-years-old, told The Guardian he has been designing for Camilla for 13-years, \"so for more years than I (designed for) Diana actually.\"To leave, Camilla donned another Ede and Ravenscroft cape, what's known as the Robe of Estate made specially for her in rich purple velvet. It was designed and hand embroidered by the Royal School of Needlework \u2014 a hand embroidery school based at Hampton Court Palace in west London, of which Camilla is patron.Among the 24 plants sewn in gold thread were lily of the valley which featured in Her Majesty's wedding bouquet (and is also known to be the favorite flower of Queen Elizabeth II), lady's mantle, myrtle, maidenhair fern, cornflowers and delphiniums \u2014 one of the King's favorite flowers and the flower for the month of July, the birth month of the Queen Consort. The national emblems of the rose, thistle and shamrock also appear.For the first time, the robe also contained embroidery of insects; bees, butterflies, beetles and a caterpillar \u2014 in keeping with the sartorial theme of pastoral appreciation.In photos: Queen Camilla's style evolutionThe Queen Consort's necklace, by Garrard, was the same as worn by Queen Elizabeth at her coronation in 1953."

But the twoin March with Chinese mediation after nearly seven years of hostility, and hope to re-open embassies soon.\u201cThis can only bring goodwill from the Iranians with the hope that it will be reciprocated,\u201d Ali Shihabi, a Saudi analyst and writer, told CNN.The kingdom is now on a mission to revamp its global image and mend fences with former foes.The diplomatic efforts are the latest in a series of moves that position Riyadh in a peacemaking role, which analysts say is a strategic pivot away from more than a decade of a confrontational and interventionist foreign policy.\u201cThere is a new foreign policy at play here,\u201d Anna Jacobs, senior Gulf analyst at the Brussels-based International Crisis Group think tank, told CNN. \u201cSaudi Arabia is seeking to assert itself more and more on the international stage through mediation and raising its diplomatic profile.\u201dRiyadh\u2019s new foreign policy is more independent and prioritizes Saudi interests, she said.The kingdom\u2019s latest attempt at diplomacy came in Sudan, where, Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) commander Abdel Fattah Al-Burhan and Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, head of the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), are vying for control. Hundreds have been killed and thousands injured in the fighting.In images broadcast widely across Saudi news outlets, Saudi Arabian forces were seen evacuating thousands of evacuees from Port Sudan to the coastal city of Jeddah, aacross the Red Sea. Men, women and children were given Saudi flags to wave as cameras documented their arrival.The kingdom on Monday said that it has evacuated more than 5,000 people from over 100 nationalities.\u201cWe will do whatever we can to alleviate this crisis,\u201d Fahad Nazer, spokesman for the Saudi embassy in the US, told CNN\u2019s Becky Anderson on Tuesday. \u201cWe are leading this effort, but we are working very closely with the United States and our regional and international partners.\u201dSpace pods and flying dragons: How Saudi Arabia wants to transform its capitalWith the help of the United States, Saudi Arabia last week also mediated a brief truce between Sudan\u2019s SAF commander Al-Burhan and RSF chief Dagalo. The truce was extended for another 72 hours on Monday, and the kingdom is reportedly joining the United Arab Emirates, the US and Egypt in efforts to broker a truce between the two commanders.\u201cThe Saudi effort in Sudan was an opportunity to put Saudi\u2019s considerable resources in the Red Sea at the international community\u2019s disposal to help,\u201d said Shihabi. \u201cAnd that can only reflect well on the Kingdom.\u201dThis new diplomacy comes as Saudi Arabia prioritizes economic growth at home, which requires regional stability to succeed. The $1 trillion economy has been on a quest to move away from its traditional reputation as a, and towards a global economic player and key.Its former interventionist policies, Jacobs said, only \u201cled to greater regional instability and increased security threats against Saudi Arabia.\u201dAside from Iran, Riyadh is mending ties with, Turkey and Syria\u2019s regime. It has been spearheading efforts to bring Syria\u2019s pariah President Bashar al-Assad back into the Arab fold over a decade after severing ties with it.And last month, senior leaders from the Palestinian militant group Hamas were seen performing an Islamic pilgrimage in Mecca. Two days later, Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas met Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, known as MBS, in the nearby city of Jeddah. Hamas and the Palestinian Authority have been at odds for over a decade. Saudi Arabia\u2019s ties with Hamas had been strained for the past decade too.Riyadh\u2019s mediation efforts have also gone beyond the Middle East. Last year, the government said it brokered a prisoner swap between Russia and Ukraine that saw 10 detainees released, including two American veterans and five British citizens.The kingdom in December said that it alsoof basketball star player Brittney Griner from Russian detention, in exchange for Russian arms dealer Viktor Bout.Saudi efforts at revamping its image as a peace-broker may face credibility challenges, however, given its near decade-long combative foreign policy and the bad press it attracted.As peace talks between Yemen\u2019s Houthis and the Saudi delegation took place in the Yemeni capital Sanaa last month, Houthi officials were keen to point out that Saudi Arabia is not a mediator in the Yemen conflict, as it has claimed, but rather a participant.Why the birthplace of Islam is hosting one of the world's biggest ravesThe kingdom is now trying to extricate itself from Yemen after intervening in the civil war there in 2015 following the Houthi takeover of Sanaa. In that war, it mobilized an Arab coalition that. That group is party to the Sudan conflict that Saudi Arabia is trying to help end.Asked by CNN whether the kingdom bears any responsibility for the Sudan conflict given its connections to RSF, Nazer of the Saudi embassy in the US said the kingdom is \u201cengaged with all relevant parties in Sudan\u201d and that Riyadh is \u201ctrying to promote an inclusive political process and dialogue that will restore peace and stability to Sudan.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re really frankly not looking backwards,\u201d he said.Despite its controversial past, Saudi Arabia may still carry enough influence to bring quarreling parties to the negotiating table, analysts say. The oil producer is home to Islam\u2019s holiest sites and is one of the richest Arab nations. It has used its wealthwith some of its former foes, especially after a brief surge in oil prices that followed Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine last year.\u201cSaudi (Arabia) does not pretend to be an impartial mediator but its voice carries weight with many parties in the region,\u201d Shihabi said, adding that where it can, Saudi Arabia wants to use that influence to reduce tensions."

        "text": "A, his wife and a doctor were on Friday jailed over an organ harvesting plot involving a young man who was trafficked to the UK for his kidney, Britain\u2019s Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said in a statement.Senator Ike Ekweremadu, his wife Beatrice and Dr. Obinna Obeta were sentenced at the UK\u2019s Central Criminal Court, known as the Old Bailey, to nine years and eight months, four years and six months, and 10 years in prison respectively in the first conviction of its kind under Britain\u2019s modern slavery laws.The three were found guilty in March of trafficking a 21-year-old street trader to the UK to provide a kidney for the Ekweremadus\u2019 daughter Sonia, who according to the CPS statement suffers from deteriorating kidneys and needs regular dialysis.Nigerian senator guilty of organ harvesting plot, UK court rulesProsecutors said the victim was brought to the UK after being offered a reward of up to \u00a37,000 ($8,810) and the promise of work in the country, but was unaware that he was expected to provide a kidney in return.A medical consultant called off the planned transplant after becoming suspicious of the circumstances surrounding it and the victim fled, sleeping rough for days before reporting the plan to UK police last May, the CPS said.\u201cThis was an horrific plot to exploit a vulnerable victim by trafficking him to the UK for the purpose of transplanting his kidney,\u201d Joanne Jakymec, Chief Crown Prosecutor, was quoted as saying.\u201cThe convicted defendants showed utter disregard for the victim\u2019s welfare, health and well-being and used their considerable influence to a high degree of control throughout, with the victim having limited understanding of what was really going on here,\u201d she continued.Detective Inspector Esther Richardson, from the Met\u2019s Modern Slavery and Exploitation Command said: \u201cThis is a landmark conviction and we commend the victim for his bravery in speaking against these offenders.\u201dEkweremadu was a former deputy senate president in Nigeria for 12 years and his case elicited sympathy in Nigeria where some saw him and his wife as victims of circumstance who were desperate to help their sick daughter.Some of the country\u2019s political class wrote to the UK court appealing for leniency ahead of his sentencing, including Nigeria\u2019s former President Olusegun Obasanjo.President of the Nigerian Senate, Ahmad Lawan,he wrote to the British judiciary on behalf of Ekweremadu asking them to \u201ctemper justice with mercy.\u201dWhile Femi Gbajabiamila, the Speaker of Nigeria\u2019s House of Representatives,Ekweremadu as \u201ca brilliant lawyer, a distinguished public servant and a dedicated family man.\u201dNigerian senator and wife charged with plotting to get child to UK to harvest organsThe speaker of parliament of the West African regional bloc ECOWAS, Sidie Mohamed Tunis said he also written to the chief clerk of the Old Bailey Court seeking leniency for the Ekweremadus.Ekweremadu served as speaker of the ECOWAS parliament between 2011 and 2015.But the calls for clemency failed to hold sway over the UK court and some in Nigeria questioned why high profile politicians were using their influence to advocate for a convicted criminal.IPC Justice, a non-governmental organization dedicated to fighting corruption in politics: \u201c\u2026 Nigeria has a reputation for not enforcing laws against political elites, which could lead to the perception of condoning criminal activity if the Speaker advocates for clemency for someone convicted of a serious crime.\u201d"

Syria has over the past decade, exporting highly addictive amphetamines across the border to Jordan and to Saudi Arabia.In the absence of what they see as lack of progress from the international community in its efforts to bring an end to the war there, Arab states have insisted on finding a regional solution, even if that means making peace with a leader whose regime has been accused of.Safadi told CNN that the Arab world is now taking the lead on resolving the Syrian crisis, as \u201cthere was no effective effort\u201d so far to do so.In a Wednesday opinion piece in Saudi newspaper Arab News, Assistant Secretary-General of the Arab League Hossam Zaki said that the May 19 summit is \u201ca step on the road toward finding and activating Arab solutionsand crises.\u201dSyria\u2019s return to the Arab League \u201cpaves the way for member states who might have been holding back to engage more directly with Assad\u2019s regime,\u201d HA Hellyer, Middle East scholar at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and at Cambridge University, told CNN. \u201cIt also makes it easier for non-member states, like Turkey and others, to argue that a new modus vivendi is in order.\u201dSyria has been under crippling Western sanctions for years, the most prominent being the US\u2019, which imposed wide-ranging sanctions that restricted individuals, companies or governments from economic activities assisting Assad\u2019s war effort. The act rendered the entire economy untouchable.The UN says the levels of poverty and food insecurity faced by Syrians today are unprecedented. The(WFP) estimates that as of 2022, more than 12 million Syrians \u2013 more than half of the country\u2019s population \u2013 are food insecure.It\u2019s unclear if the US will stand in the way of Arab states\u2019 efforts to bring Syria back into the regional fold. Safadi told CNN that Jordan and other Arab countries are constantly discussing the matter with Washington and are working towards a solution that is consistent with UN Resolution 2254.Analysts say that while Western states may object to the normalization, they are unlikely to translate that objection into any kind of action against the Arab states, citing other international issues that take priority, as well as fatigue with the Syrian question.\u201cThe US will not impose a veto on their allies when it comes to normalization with Assad,\u201d said Hellyer. \u201cThe political will for such a move doesn\u2019t exist in DC, particularly when there are so many other files that are taking bandwidth for the US, both in (the Middle East), but also more widely internationally, with Ukraine and other issues.\u201dQutaiba Idlbi, a nonresident fellow at the Atlantic Council in Washington, DC, said that US normalization with the Assad regime is unlikely to bring any foreign policy or security benefits to the Biden administration, and will therefore not be pursued, especially ahead of the presidential elections next year. Arab normalization, he argued, may be seen in a positive light in Washington despite its public objections as it \u201cstrengthens regional leadership on regional issues.\u201dThe unexpected journey to power of Bashar al-AssadGiven the wide-ranging scope of the sanctions on the regime, however, Syria is more likely to get a political lifeline from normalization than an economic one, analysts said \u2013 at least until Arab states can persuade the international community to embrace the Syrian president. Analysts say that\u2019ll be a tough sell.Charles Lister, a senior fellow at the Middle East Institute in Washington, DC, said the sanctions have left both American and European governments \u201chandcuffed,\u201d placing a legal impediment to engagement with the regime.\u201cAs we watch these regional steps, which are at least symbolically significant, I don\u2019t think we are going to be seeing much more than political contact,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cWe are certainly not going to see some major shift toward investment in Syria\u2026 none of that is going to be feasible without Western diplomatic and economic support.

        "link": "https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/05/uk/rishi-sunak-local-elections-results-intl-gbr-cmd/index.html",
        "text": "Many Britons will enjoy the long weekend while celebrating thePrime Minister Rishi Sunak is unlikely to be one of them.Instead, he will be pondering a bleak future after watching a dire set of results pour in from a swath of municipal elections held around the country on Thursday. And they made grim viewing for a man hoping to lead his Conservative Party back to power in just over a year\u2019s time at the next UK general election.With most of the results declared by early evening on Friday, the Conservatives had lost control of 45 local administrations and shed more than 1,000 councilors.Before Thursday\u2019s votes, the Conservatives had been in expectation management mode, briefing journalists they would lose heavily in areas that had been in Conservative hands for years.  Presumably, party officials had hoped privately that it wouldn\u2019t be as bad as that.The main opposition Labour Party could barely conceal its glee \u2013 the results would translate to a nine-point national lead according to PA Media. Labour boasted that the results show it would not just beat Sunak at the next election, but do so decisively.The task ahead of Sunak is a daunting one. At most, he has until January 2025 \u2013 the last date he can legally hold an election \u2013 to turn things around. In reality, he hopes to hold the vote in the fall of next year.The British economy is in big trouble after 13 years of Conservative government. Some of the reasons for this have been out of the government\u2019s hands. But it was ultimately various iterations of this government that decided to erect punitive post-Brexit trade borders with Europe and propose unfunded tax cuts that caused the pound to tank.Public services, including the much-loved National Health Service, are in a dire state. It can take weeks to arrange an appointment with your doctor and months to get a vital medical procedure.Teachers, doctors, nurses, train drivers and workers in many other services have held strikes over pay and working conditions, with polls consistently showing that the public thinks the government is handling negotiations with unions poorly.Immigration, one of the hottest issues in British politics for decades, is making headlines almost daily as an increasing number of migrants arrive in the UK on small boats, often arranged by criminal human trafficking gangs.Against this backdrop, taxes are at their highest in decades and trust in Sunak\u2019s party is low.Fixing everything before the election is a tall order on its own. What Sunak must also do, if he\u2019s to turn things around in just over a year, is stop his party from tearing itself apart.The blame game for Conservative woes started last summer after its lawmakers forced Boris Johnson out of office after months of scandals \u2013 including the notorious \u201cPartygate\u201d scandal when officials in Downing Street were revealed to have held parties that broke Covid-19 restrictions.Johnson loyalists insist it was a grave mistake to have removed him from office. They claim Johnson was responsible for the party winning a parliamentary majority in the 2019 general election, a victory they regard as his personal mandate. They argue that removing a man they see as the Conservative\u2019s biggest electoral asset has blown up credibility the party might have with the public. And they blame those who ultimately made Johnson\u2019s position untenable \u2013 including Sunak, whose resignation from Johnson\u2019s Cabinet was arguably the final nail in his coffin \u2013 for the current mess.The anti-Johnson cohort, meanwhile, think he trashed the reputation of the party while in office.Partygate created the perception that the government, led by Johnson, didn\u2019t believe the pandemic rules applied to people running the country. While Sunak and Johnson both received fines after a police investigation, Sunak emerged relatively unscathed.There were other scandals on Johnson\u2019s watch \u2013 from his personal financial arrangements to cronyism \u2013\u00a0that created a stench of sleaze around the Conservatives that Sunak has struggled to shake off.These two main factions both agree that the short premiership of Liz Truss, who succeeded Johnson last summer but only managed to stay in office for 45 days, has done real damage to the Conservatives\u2019 main electoral selling point: economic credibility. She proposed unfunded spending and tax cuts that caused the pound to fall to its lowest against the dollar since 1985, and did not survive the ensuing fallout.Suank\u2019s loyalists point out that Truss was team Johnson\u2019s preferred candidate, but almost everyone in Westminster has distanced themselves from her short tenure.Ahead of this latest set of local elections, there was concern among some in the party that poor results might cause for loud calls from the right of the party for someone to challenge Sunak. There are people who sincerely believe Johnson returning ahead of the next election would give them the best chance at victory.However, these people are now a minority and Johnson has gone off grid, earning huge amounts of money giving speeches and writing books. But that doesn\u2019t mean his supporters cannot still cause problems for Sunak.Next week, a group of Conservatives broadly from the Johnson wing of the party will meet at a conference organized by the Conservative Democrat Organisation. Speakers include three of Johnson\u2019s most loyal Cabinet ministers and one of his biggest financial supporters.They are, it is commonly accepted, a group that believes Johnson was kicked out of office unfairly and that Sunak was imposed on them and their grassroots members by the big cheeses of the Conservative Party. Most of them have said publicly in the months since Johnson resigned that they wish he was still PM.Right now, most of the party seems to be on message. They are downplaying the local elections and pointing out that Labour would still need a swing bigger than Tony Blair achieved in 1997 to win a majority of just one seat. They also believe that Sunak\u2019s rise in popularity is down to the relative stability he has brought since taking over from Truss.But if polls don\u2019t improve dramatically, Sunak should start looking over his shoulder. The Conservative Party has developed a taste for regicide since 2016. If the economy fails to improve, if he can\u2019t live up to his promise to \u201cstop the boats\u201d of migrants and if Conservative members of parliament start to fear they will suffer the same fate as those who lost their jobs in these elections, then it\u2019s not a giant leap from mild concern to panic \u2013 and calls for a new way forward before the party is booted from power."

Queen Elizabeth II\u2019s death last September brought to an end an era defined by the late monarch\u2019s steadfast dedication to duty, amid rapidly changing times.Just 21% say their views on the royal family have gotten more positive over the past decade, withanother 41% saying their overall opinion has stayed the same. And three in 10 say they have become less interested in news about the family over that time, while 22% say they have grown more interested. A little less than half say that their interest level hasn\u2019t changed.Most Britons say they plan to take part in at least one event this weekend related to the coronation, which is set to be a magnificent display of tradition and pageantry.But the public celebration of the new King comes as at a time when decades of demographic, religious and societal change have resulted into the monarchy, following the longest interlude between two coronations in British history.UK residents are split in their level of interest in the coronation, the polling suggests, with broader views about the royal family and its members markedby generational divides.Half of UK adults say they\u2019re interested in the coronation, with only a fifth describing themselves as \u201cvery interested.\u201dMost say they plan to participate in at least one activity surrounding the festivities this weekend, with 40% planning to watch the coronation ceremony, 28% to watch theon Sunday, 14% to attend a street party or other community event, and 7% to volunteer as part of the \u201cBig Help Out\u201d initiative. Just over a third plan to opt out of coronation-related events entirely.Those age 55 and older are roughly 10 percentage points likelier than younger adults to say they\u2019re interested in the coronation. Theywere most likely to say they\u2019ll watch the ceremony, with about half planning to tune in.By contrast, 37% of those age 35-54 and just 31% of those younger than 35 say they intend to watch the event, as an increasing number of young Britons express their indifference to or dislike for an institution they sayin their lives.Ahead of the Queen\u2019s Platinum Jubilee celebrations last June, CNN spoke to young people in the UK who cited factors from British colonialism to a lack of diversity as reasons for feeling disconnected to the monarchy.Adults younger than 35 are more likely than their older counterparts to say they\u2019re planning to participate in the volunteer effort. Women are 10 points likelier than men to say they plan to watch the coronation concert, and 9 points likelier to say they\u2019ll watch the ceremony.More broadly, the poll finds the UK public reporting declining interest in \u2013 and opinions of \u2013 the royal family over the past decade, a period during which the institution has been embroiled in a series of controversies that have threatened the family\u2019s popularity.In 2019, Prince Andrewfrom his royal duties over his ties to disgraced financier and convicted pedophile Jeffrey Epstein. A day after a judge ruled a sexual abuse civil lawsuit filed by Virginia Giuffre against Andrew could proceed, Buckingham Palace announced that he had beenand charities.

More than half (55%) of UK adults younger than 25 say that they don\u2019t consider the royal family a good source of leadership and guidance, a view shared by just 36% of those aged 55 or older.But not all members of the royal family are viewed in the same light. William, Prince of Walesand Catherine, Princess of Wales are the best regarded: 62% of UK adults hold a favorable view of both, with just 14% and 13%, respectively, viewing them unfavorably, and the remainder neutral or expressing no opinion. Just less than half have a favorable view of King Charles, with 23% rating him unfavorably.Views of Queen Camilla are more split, with 34% rating her favorably, 32% unfavorably, and 31% saying their view is neither positive or negative. And opinions of Prince Harry and Meghan are underwater, with 52% and 56%, respectively, rating them unfavorably, and fewer than 3 in 10 expressing positive views of either.'It's not a good look.' As cost of living crisis bites, some Brits are questioning spending money on glitzy coronationWithin the UK public, opinions on specific royals differ sharply by age. Older adults are substantially more positive than younger adults toward King Charles \u2013 almost two-thirds of those older than 55 view him favorably, compared with about a third of those younger than 35.The same pattern holds true for opinions of Queen Camilla, who has a 44% favorability rating among those age 55 and older and a 23% favorability rating among under-35s, and for both the Prince of Wales (78% vs. 46%) and Princess of Wales (78% vs. 44%).By contrast, the age dynamic is reversed for the Duke and Duchess of Sussex: 42% of UK adults younger than 35 hold a favorable opinion of Prince Harry, compared with just 13% of those 55 and older, and 40% in the youngest group view Meghan positively, compared with 10% among the oldest group.The poll was conducted on March 24 through 26 among a random sample of 2,093 UK adults aged 18 and older. Surveys were conducted online, and weighted to be representative of the UK by age, sex, region and social grade. Results for the full sample have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 2.2 percentage points; it is larger for subgroups.CNN\u2019s Lauren Said-Moorhouse, Max Foster, Hafsa Khalil and Ivana Kottasov\u00e1 contributed reporting."

        "text": "A new mission designed to improve hurricane forecasting has launched, just ahead of the June 1 arrival of the.The NASA mission includes a constellation of CubeSats called TROPICS, or Time-Resolved Observations of Precipitation structure and storm Intensity with a Constellation of Smallsats.The first two CubeSats lifted off from M\u0101hia, New Zealand, aboard a Rocket Lab Electron rocket at 9 p.m. ET on Sunday.The first mission was nicknamed \u201cRocket Like a Hurricane,\u201d while two additional CubeSats, nicknamed \u201cComing to a Storm Near You,\u201d will launch from the same location in about two weeks.Together, the four satellites, each weighing 12 pounds and about the size of a loaf of bread, will observe tropical cyclones from low-Earth orbit.Once all of them are in orbit, the tiny satellites will form a constellation that makes more frequent observations than current weather-monitoring satellites.\u201cThe need for improved climate and weather data from space is acute and growing. Hurricanes and tropical storms have a devastating effect on lives and livelihoods, so we\u2019re immensely proud to be entrusted by NASA to launch the TROPICS missions which will enable scientists and researchers to accurately predict storm strength and give people time to evacuate and make plans,\u201d said Rocket Lab founder and CEO Peter Beck in a statement. \u201cWith the 2023 hurricane season fast approaching, time is of the essence for these missions.\u201dEach CubeSat will orbit at about 340 miles (550 kilometers) above Earth\u2019s surface and capture hourly observations of the precipitation, temperature and humidity of tropical storms. Current satellites take similar data, but only about every six hours, which makes it more difficult to measure the intensity of storms.More frequent data can help scientists understand the rapid changes that can occur within a storm, impacting its structure and stability, and help meteorologists improve their prediction and forecasting models.During the, there were so many tropical storms and hurricanes that meteorologists ran out of names on the predefined list and had to switch to the Greek alphabet \u2014 and then the, said Ben Kim, program executive at NASA\u2019s Earth Science Division.In 2022,, but Hurricane Ian alone caused more than $100 billion in damages and caused more than 100 fatalities, Kim said.La Ni\u00f1a has ended and El Ni\u00f1o will form during hurricane season, forecasters say\u201cTROPICS aims to improve our scientific understanding by obtaining microwave observations that allow us to see the inner structure of the storm approximately hourly,\u201d Kim said. \u201cThese observations will complement existing weather satellites and ultimately then can be tied to the broader understanding of the entire Earth system.\u201dData collected by TROPICS will be shared with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center, the National Hurricane Center and other partners. The satellites will measure water vapor primarily located in the troposphere, or the lowest layer of Earth\u2019s atmosphere, where most weather phenomena occurs.\u201cThe exciting thing about this is its the ability to see inside the storms, but it\u2019s also the ability to see how the storms are changing over short periods of time,\u201d said Dr. Will McCarty, program scientist at NASA\u2019s Earth Science Division."

Due to the intensity of the violence, UNICEF was unable to confirm the estimates, she added.Jan Egeland, Secretary General of the Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC) warned on Wednesday that people trapped in battlefields are running out of water and food.\u201cFamilies across Sudan, including those of our colleagues, are being torn apart, and having to choose between remaining trapped in the battlefield, or risking their lives to flee or reach an overcrowded hospital,\u201d Egeland said in a statement.\u201cThey are running out of everything, including water, food, electricity, fuel, and cash. We need the international community to put as much effort into secure humanitarian access, regardless of ceasefire and in providing aid to millions of people as they have in evacuating their own citizens,\u201d he added.The violence has triggered a mass exodus of refugees from Sudan, with the UN\u2019s refugee agency (UNHCR) on Thursday warning that $445 million is needed to help the 860,000 refugees and returnees who could escape the country by October.According to a UNHCR statement, the plan was designed by \u201c134 partners, including UN agencies, national and international NGOS and civil society groups\u201d and includes a contingency strategy for new arrivals (refugees, returning refugees and others) to neighbouring countries.\u201dAmerican trapped in Sudan is desperate to escape amid deadly military clashesAt the same time, hundreds of evacuees arrived from Sudan in Nigeria on Wednesday after being held up for days at the Egyptian border for days, as reports over theto the uptick in evacuees continue.The first contingent of 376 Nigerians were flown home in a military aircraft and a local carrier and arrived in the capital Abuja shortly before midnight, according to the Nigerians In Diaspora Commission (NIDCOM).Last week, more than 7,000 Nigerian nationals, mostly students fleeing the Sudan conflict had been left stranded at the Egyptian border due to the unavailability of visas, NIDCOM said while appealing to Egyptian authorities \u201cto kindly allow the already traumatized travellers to transit to their final destinations.\u201dCNN\u2019s Duarte Mendonca and Nimi Princewill contributed reporting."

It travels 10 times the speed of sound and can be fired far from the battlefield, making them difficult to intercept.Ukraine has received at least two Patriot systems, one from the United States and one from Germany, to enhance its air defenses, which have previously been unable to intercept more modern Russian missiles such as the Kinzhal.If it is confirmed that Ukraine successfully shot down Kinzhal it raises questions about Russian capabilities.Ukrainian air force spokesman Yurii Inhat said Saturday that the Russians said \u201cthe Patriot is an outdated American weapon, and Russian weapons are the best in the world.\u201d\u201cWell, there is confirmation that it effectively works against even a super hypersonic missile,\u201d Ihnat said, adding that intercepting the Kinzhal is \u201ca slap in the face for Russia.\u201dLast month Defense Minister Oleksii Reznikov said that Patriots would be critical in defending Ukrainian infrastructure against ballistic missiles.\u201cBuilding a multi-level air and missile defense system as soon as possible is our priority,\u201d he declared. \u201cThis is to protect peaceful cities, critical infrastructure, and our people in the rear and at the front.

For this last 5%, the \u2018Red Army\u2019 [the Russian Armed Forces] are not playing any role,\u201d Prigozhin said.\u201cWe don\u2019t have the necessary ammunition, and no one has communicated with us about getting back to full capacity,\u201d Prigozhin said.\u201cIt is better to save our army than to win a battle.\u201dThe announcement by Prigozhin \u2013 sometimes dubbed \u201cPutin\u2019s chef\u201d because his catering companies provided services for the Kremlin \u2013 follows the release last week ofin which he challenged Russia\u2019s military leadership and blamed defense chiefs for \u201ctens of thousands\u201d of Wagner casualties.Prigozhin, whose Wagner mercenary group has taken on a growing role in the Ukraine conflict as Russian forces falter, has been highly visible on the front lines in recent months \u2013 where he has claimed credit for territorial gains, particularly in the battles raging around the eastern Ukrainian city of Bakhmut.But as Prigozhin\u2019s stature has increased, so too have his clashes with Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu and chief of the Russian armed forces Gen. Valery Gerasimov, prompting speculation about possible elite infighting in Moscow as Russia\u2019s military campaign fails to advance.In February, Prigozhin accused the two men of \u201ctreason\u201d for their alleged failures to support and supply the Wagner group in Ukraine.His most recent challenge to Russian defense officials comes as Bakhmut remains heavily contested.Putin faces a deluge of bad news as Wagner says it will withdraw from frontline and Kremlin comes under attackIn his Telegram message Saturday, Prigozhin said Wagner\u2019s role in Bakhmut had been to grind down Ukrainian forces while allowing Russian forces to regroup.\u201cOn October 8, 2022, together with the Army General Sergei Surovikin, it was decided to launch the operation \u2018Bakhmut meat grinder\u2019 \u2013 an assault on the village of Bakhmut in order to provoke (Ukrainian President) Vladimir Zelensky to throw in as many forces as possible to hold Bakhmut. In Bakhmut, we grinded (the Ukrainian forces), hence the name \u2013 \u2018Bakhmut meat grinder,\u2019\u201d Prigozhin said.\u201cThe purpose of the operation \u2018Bakhmut meat grinder\u2019 was to enable the units of the Russian army to take advantageous lines of defense, mobilize, re-equip, train personnel and increase their combat potential,\u201d he added.\u201cWith regards to the Bakhmut meat grinder, there will be no more meat grinder because there\u2019s nothing left to grind the meat with,\u201d Prigozhin said.Prigozhin\u2019s message came as the notorious Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov called on Wagner fighters to join forces with his Akhmat battalion in Bakhmut.\u201cThe Wagner (company) has very good, courageous, necessary, necessary people, necessary to us, because they know the area,\u201d Kadyrov said in a video message on Saturday.\u201cIf you stay with us, I promise you that we will give you more, create better conditions, than you have today. We will try to make everything top notch for you,\u201d said Kadyrov, an ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin.\u201cYou (Wagner fighters) know our commanders. You can contact them \u2013 any group, the number does not matter,\u201d the Chechen leader noted.Kadyrov also posted an image of his letter to Putin \u201cto issue combat orders on the removal of Akhmat units from other directions in order to hand Wagner positions in Bakhmut over to them.\u201dAdditional reporting by Brad Lendon"

        "text": "Late last year, after a breakneck ascent of British politics put her in charge of the country\u2019s migration, crime and national security agenda, Suella Braverman revealed her political fantasy.\u201cI would love to (see) a front page of The Telegraph with a plane taking off to Rwanda,\u201d the home secretary (interior minister) told that newspaper, referring to herto deport asylum-seekers to the central African nation. \u201cThat\u2019s my dream. That\u2019s my obsession.\u201dBraverman is no stranger to the front pages. Her self-proclaimed \u201cobsession\u201d with curbing migration \u2013 and the loaded and occasionally inflammatory language she uses to address it \u2013 has attracted forceful criticism from international agencies, lawyers, rights groups and many of her own colleagues, making her arguably Britain\u2019s most divisive politician.But among Conservative Party members and the chief architects of Brexit, she is a star; someone who is prepared to say and do controversial things in pursuit of a singular goal.\u201cShe\u2019s the cutting edge of the populist, radical right-wing strain in the Conservative Party,\u201d Tim Bale, a professor of politics at Queen Mary University in London, and the author of books on the party, told CNN.\u201cIn a way, that allows her to say what some Conservative MPs would think of as the unsayable.\u201dBraverman has railed against what she calls an \u201cinvasion\u201d of migrants, holding \u201cvalues which are at odds with our country\u201d \u2013 and suggested she would break international law to deport them.And she is an equally furious culture warrior, borrowing rhetoric from the American right when lambasting \u201cwoke\u201d culture, transgender rights and climate protesters.\u201cShe\u2019s recognized that in the current political climate, her way of creating an impact\u2026 (is) positioning herself as a Trump tribute act,\u201d migration policy expert and campaigner Zoe Gardner told CNN.But Braverman has speedily made herself a central figure in British politics; the assassin of Liz Truss\u2019s premiership and the kingmaker of Rishi Sunak\u2019s, she has made evident her desire to ultimately enter Downing Street as prime minister herself \u2013 a prospect that sits uneasily with much of the country\u2019s political establishment.Braverman, who evangelizes on the benefits of Brexit and has made migration curbs her political mission, has a backstory that seems to teem with contradictions.She is the daughter of migrants, who wants to cut net migration to Britain to the \u201ctens of thousands.\u201d Her parents, both of Indian origin, arrived in the country from Kenya and Mauritius \u201cwith very little\u201d in the 1960s.She was a practicing lawyer before entering politics, but has displayed an unabashed indifference about whether her flagship migration billAnd she is an avid Francophile, sometimes speaking in French when meeting her counterpart in Paris, who championed the project to leave the European Union. Braverman says she fell in love with France while studying at the renowned Sorbonne university in Paris, taking advantage of the EU\u2019s Erasmus program that encourages students to spend time in other parts of the continent. Brexit shut the program off to British students.Now, she has staked her political reputation on her ability to \u201cStop the Boats\u201d \u2013 an oft-repeated government pledge, borrowed from Australia\u2019s hardline rhetoric towards asylum-seekers, to reduce the growing number of migrants crossing the English Channel on small vessels.It is a stance that has drawn sharp criticism \u2013 including from within the traditional wing of Braverman\u2019s Conservative Party.\u201cBraverman has placed far too much emphasis on curbing migration,\u201d said Ben Ramanauskas, an economist and adviser to Truss when the previous prime minister was secretary of state for international trade. \u201cHer priority seems to be attempting to be as cruel as possible.\u201dThe government\u2019s flagship bill, which was approved by MPs last week but faces scrutiny in the House of Lords, essentially hands the government the right to deport anyone arriving illegally in the United Kingdom. \u201cIt\u2019s incredibly dangerous, hostile, cruel, and fundamentally unworkable,\u201d Gardner  said.And experts say it deliberately misses the point. \u201cDeterrents don\u2019t work\u2026 There is absolutely no correlation whatsoever between how brutally we respond to migration, and the numbers of people forced to move,\u201d Gardner said. \u201cWe need a functioning asylum system where we process people\u2019s claims, (and) we need to give people safe routes in order to travel.\u201dUK plan to house migrants in barracks and barges is condemned as 'cruel' and unworkableBraverman, however, is steadfast in the face of criticism. The Home Office told CNN in a statement that her bill \u201cwill break the business model of the people smuggling gangs and restore fairness to our asylum system. It will ensure anyone arriving via small boat or other dangerous and illegal means will be in scope for detention and swiftly removed.\u201dBraverman\u2019s plans have won praise from Europe\u2019s leading populist figures, including Italy\u2019s hardline deputy leader Matteo Salvini and French far-right presidential candidate Eric Zemmour.But that is company many in the Conservatives feel uncomfortable keeping.\u201cThe UK\u2019s ability to play a role internationally is based on our reputation \u2013 not because we\u2019re British, but because of what we stand for and what we do,\u201d ex-Prime Minister Theresa May said in a stinging intervention in the House of Commons last month. May added last week that the bill\u2019s removal of modern slavery protections \u201cwill consign victims to remaining in slavery.\u201dAnd Sayeeda Warsi, the first Asian chair of the Tory party, has attacked what she described as Braverman\u2019s \u201cracist rhetoric,\u201d after Braverman prompted controversy by singling out British Pakistani men when attacking grooming gangs in the country.\u201cBraverman\u2019s own ethnic origin has shielded her from criticism for too long,\u201d Warsi. \u201cBlack and brown people can be racist too.\u201d The Home Office told CNN that Braverman \u201chas been clear that all despicable child abusers must be brought to justice. And she will not shy away from telling hard truths, particularly when it comes to the grooming of young women and girls in Britain\u2019s towns who have been failed by authorities over decades.\u201dBraverman fronts a newer, more populist streak in the UK\u2019s ruling party \u2013 a move that has troubled some of its grandees but has found an audience among voters.\u201cThe voters that she\u2019s appealing to is the majority of the British public,\u201d said James Johnson, who ran polling in May\u2019s Downing Street operation and later founded the JL Partners pollster. \u201cThere is a very significant disconnect between what people on Twitter about immigration, and what people actually think about immigration.\u201cVoters do not react to (Braverman\u2019s) language with the same outrage that some people do,\u201d he told CNN. \u201c(They) want their politicians to at least be trying.\u201dPolling shows that approval of Braverman\u2019s tough stance on migration significantly outpaces support for the government in general \u2013 as well as approval of Braverman herself \u2013 with research often indicating that a slim majority of the public supports her plans.And those who support her \u2013 particularly those in Euroskeptic circles, where she is almost revered \u2013 say Braverman speaks to the concerns of modern Britain in a way that her more seasoned critics cannot. \u201cWhen finally even I wobbled about backing Brexit in name only, Suella stood firm,\u201d prominent Brexit backer Steve Bakerwhen he supported her leadership campaign last year, praising Braverman\u2019s resolve to defeat May\u2019s Brexit deal and push for a harder-line departure from the EU. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t have happened without her.\u201dBut research has also shown that the importance of immigration to British voters has receded since the bitter debates of the mid-2010s.It appears inevitable that the Tories will seek to make migration a wedge issue at the next election, ensuring Braverman plenty of airtime as the government looks to draw a contrast between itself and the Labour party. But a series of brutal electoral results in local polls on Thursday will further fuel questions about whether that is a winning strategy.Braverman\u2019s political coming-of-age took place just as the 2016 EU referendum shifted the tectonic plates underneath Westminster, giving younger, Euroskeptic voices like hers an inroad with the public.It was Braverman\u2019s role fronting an anti-EU backbench committee that \u201cpropelled her to her (current) position, and she knows it,\u201d former Conservative MP Antoinette Sandbach told CNN.Today, she takes the populist mantle further than many of her peers on a range of matters far beyond Brexit. Braverman appears to relish \u201cculture war\u201d confrontations with her political enemies like few other frontline politicians; \u201cyou almost feel sometimes that she gets a kick out of \u2018owning the libs,\u2019\u201d the politics professor Bale told CNN.She has taken aim at the \u201cGuardian-reading, tofu-eating wokerati\u201d from the despatch box, and insisted she will \u201cnot be hectored by out-of-touch lefties.\u201d In 2019, she said she considers herself engaged in a \u201cbattle against cultural Marxism.\u201dBraverman\u2019s Home Office recently reportedly backed two pub landlords who refused to remove their minstrel-style children\u2019s toys that are considered a racist relic of the 1970s. And she has criticized police officers for \u201cvirtue signaling,\u201d saying in a speech last week that \u201cthey shouldn\u2019t be taking the knee.\u201dBut those battles have left some traditional Tories cold. \u201cThe Conservative Party has moved right since I joined, and become much more like the MAGA Republicans\u201d since the dividing line of 2016, said Sandbach, who was expelled from the party by Boris Johnson after trying to avert a no-deal Brexit. She subsequently joined the Liberal Democrats.Those who worked alongside Braverman describe her as friendly and personable, and few doubt her ambition.As 23-year-old Suella Fernandes, she nearly ran against her own mother to become the Tory candidate in a 2003 by-election, until the elder Fernandes \u2013 a Conservative councilor and NHS nurse \u2013 persuaded her to pull out.Braverman succeeded in becoming an MP in 2015. In athat bemoaned her \u201clamentable hopelessness,\u201d one of her more critical backbenchers, William Wragg, claimed she asked in her first week in Parliament whether she could expense a fine for speeding.But her determination to drive towards power has served her well. No politician emerged more triumphant from the psychodrama that has transfixed British politics than Braverman, who started 2022 as attorney general and ended it a household name \u2013 having served in three different Cabinets, twice as home secretary.An initial departure from frontline politics(Braverman resigned for breaching ministerial rules by using a private email address), but her scathing parting letter turned her misconduct into a maneuver, essentially pulling the plug on Truss\u2019s shambolic tenure.The 'anti-woke' crusade has come to Europe. Its effects could be chilling\u201cI have made a mistake; I accept responsibility: I resign,\u201d Braverman wrote, in a thinly veiled attempt to contrast herself with Truss. Six days later she was back in the same post, having aligned herself with Sunak\u2019s successful leadership bid.Few doubt Braverman\u2019s long-term ambitions. \u201cYou have to interpret everything Suella Braverman does and says in the light of the leadership contest that many people assume will take place if\u2026 Sunak were to lose the next election,\u201d Bale said.Crucial to that target is her reputation among party members and its more hardline MPs. It is those groups that pick a party leader, and she is met enthusiastically by grassroots Conservatives who tend to reflect the more right-wing, populist traits of the bloc.That prospect undoubtedly perturbs some. \u201cThere will be many Tory MPs who simply could not stomach her as leader,\u201d Bale added. \u201cI think the lack of support she received in her leadership bid (last year) reflects how she was seen by the party as a whole,\u201d Sandbach said.Nevertheless, Braverman is storming up the approval rankings among ordinary Conservative members. In its latest monthly league table of Cabinet ministers, the ConservativeHome website \u2013 widely regarded as having its finger on the pulse of the grassroots party \u2013 puts Braverman fourth from the top with a net approval rating of 47.8. Only last November, she was sixth from bottom in the site\u2019s regular survey of party members. \u201cThe panel seems to have decided that if the Government fails to stop the boats it won\u2019t be for want of the Home Secretary trying,\u201d.Should Braverman succeed at her next bid for the party leadership, her critics fear another rightwards shift in British politics.\u201cBraverman has taken some cues from the US, and also from history,\u201d Gardner said.\u201cShe\u2019s setting herself up to lead a more extreme, right-wing populist version of the Tory party.\u201d"

Last weekend,from the city if Moscow didn\u2019t provide more ammunition.In a separate statement posted to Telegram on Friday, Prigozhin repeated the threat, saying his private military company would leave Bakhmut on May 10 due to a lack of ammunition.\u201cI declare on behalf of the Wagner fighters, on behalf of the Wagner command, that on May 10, 2023, we are obliged to transfer positions in the settlement of Bakhmut to units of the Defense Ministry and withdraw the remains of Wagner to logistics camps to lick our wounds,\u201d Prigozhin said.\u201cI\u2019m withdrawing Wagner PMC units because without ammunition, they are doomed to a senseless death,\u201d said Prigozhin, adding that Wagner had fallen \u201cout of favor with envious near-military bureaucrats.\u201dKnown for its disregard for the lives of its own soldiers, the Wagner group\u2019s brutal and often lawless tactics are believed to have resulted in high numbers of casualties, as new recruits are sent into battle with little formal training \u2013 a process described by retired United States Lt. Gen. Mark Hertling as \u201clike feeding meat to a meat grinder.\u201dBut as Prigozhin\u2019s stature has increased, so too have his clashes with Shoigu and Gerasimov, prompting speculation about possible elite infighting in Moscow as Russia\u2019s military campaign fails to advance.In February, he accused the two men of \u201ctreason\u201d for their alleged failures to support and supply the Wagner group in Ukraine.His newest challenge to Russian defense officials comes as Bakhmut remains heavily contested.\u201cThese are someone\u2019s f**king fathers and someone\u2019s sons. And you f**kers who aren\u2019t giving [us] ammunition, you b*tches, will have your guts eaten out in hell!\u201d yelled Prigozhin in Thursday\u2019s video.CNN\u2019s Nathan Hodge contributed to this report."

Attempts to begin repatriation in 2018 and 2019 failed as the refugees, fearing violence, refused to go back.The UN refugee agency (UNHCR) said every refugee had \u201can inalienable right\u201d to return to their home country, but that returns also had to be voluntary.\u201cUNHCR maintains that dialogue with the Rohingya refugees is a must to make an informed decision,\u201d the agency said in a statement.\u201cVisits are an important part of voluntary refugee returns, providing a chance for people to observe conditions in their home country first-hand ahead of return and contributing to the making of an informed decision on return.\u201d"

        "text": "A cargo train loaded with tanks chugs along under the crisp, spring sun. \u201cWow,\u201d a woman says, pointing her camera phone at the convoy. \u201cThis is the second train, there was one like it just before.\u201dThe video, seemingly filmed in late March, shows old Soviet tanks being transported, somewhere in Russia. Moscow has been known tofrom storage to help it prosecute the war in Ukraine, but these are different.The tanks are T-55s, a model first commissioned by the Soviet Union\u2019s Red Army in 1948, shortly after the end of World War II.They\u2019re so old, you can find them in museums.\u201cThis was the first main battle tank used by the Soviet Union in the Cold War era,\u201d said historian John Delaney, a senior curator at the Imperial War Museum (IWM) in Duxford, Cambridge, as he shows one to CNN.\u201cUp until that point, you\u2019d had three very distinctive types of tanks, light, medium and heavy, which had different roles on the battlefield,\u201d Delaney said. \u201cFrom the mid-50s onwards, there was this concept that tried to come up with a tank that could do a bit of everything and that became known as the main battle tank.\u201dFor the Red Army, that was the T-55 and its many variants, which later became the most widely produced tank in the world, with more than 100,000 units built. Cheap, reliable, easy to use and easy to maintain, it was a military mainstay from Egypt to China to Sudan, where they are still in use.In Eastern Europe, they were used to quash uprisings in the former Warsaw Pact countries, rolling through the streets of Hungary in 1956, and then Prague, capital of what was then Czechoslovakia, in 1968.But in following decades, when deployed against Western-built tanks \u2013 in some Arab-Israeli conflicts, and then in the Gulf War \u2013 they were no match.\u201cIn the first Gulf War, in 1991 for example, the American and British tanks were knocking out Iraqi T-55s from 23 kilometers,\u201d Delaney said.The version inside the IWM\u2019s Land Warfare hall was built in the 1960s and belonged to the East German army. It was snapped up by the museum after German reunification, with Berlin favoring NATO-standard versions, such as the Leopard 1 and then Leopard 2 \u2014 which it has recently sent to Ukraine \u2014 and side-lining outdated Soviet equipment.By the time Russia began decommissioning its own T-55s in the 1980s, there were still upwards of 28,000 of them, Delaney said, adding that they were mothballed rather than scrapped.\u201cThe Soviets never threw anything away,\u201d he explained. \u201cThere\u2019s probably a significant number of them sitting in sheds waiting to be reconfigured.\u201dRussia seems willing to do exactly that.Satellite imagery indicates Russia has been taking dozens of tanks out of storage at a base in Arsenyev, in Russia\u2019s far East. Publicly available photos show one of the tanks being stored at the base is the T-55.\u201cThey\u2019ll have been sitting there for a decade or more,\u201d Delaney says. \u201cThey\u2019ll need a considerable amount of work to get them back into good running order.\u201dAfter the footage of a trainload of tanks surfaced on social media in late March, the Conflict Intelligence Team (CIT), a team group of volunteers using open source intelligence to investigate conflicts in Ukraine and Syria, was thethese that T-54/55s were being brought out of storage at Arsenyev.Western officials then told CNN in April they had seen the elderly tank pop up close to the frontline.US to begin training Ukrainian forces on Abrams tanks next monthRussia hasn\u2019t confirmed it is deploying the T-55 to the front line and the Ministry of Defense in Moscow did not respond to CNN\u2019s request for comment. But, in recent weeks, well-connected pro-Kremlin bloggers have shared photographs showing these tanks, reportedly in Russian-occupied territories in Ukraine.The Netherlands-based open-source intelligence website Oryx says it has visual evidence Russia has lost more than 1,900 tanks since the beginning of the invasion, nearly two-thirds of an initial fleet of around 3,000. Beyond quantity, a big issue is the speed at which Russian armor is being taken down.\u201cOverall Russia has lost a lot of equipment, it\u2019s hard to build new equipment,\u201d said Robert Lee, a former US Marine and senior fellow at the US-based Foreign Policy Research Institute.\u201cThey are producing some new tanks \u2014 they are still producing T-90s \u2014 but, at the scale (required), they need more equipment than they can produce so they\u2019re relying on older and older tanks to compensate,\u201d Lee added.Trevor Taylor, director of the Defence, Industries and Society Programme at the Royal United Services Institute, says Western sanctions are also slowing down Russia\u2019s weapons production.\u201cWe\u2019ve got multiple pieces of evidence that Russian industry, which had been given access to Western technology in the 90s, is really suffering from the restrictions,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cWe\u2019re hearing about them taking chips out of washing machines. And when you\u2019re doing that, then you\u2019re really obviously in quite a bit of difficulty.\u201dLee has been following the Russian invasion of Ukraine from the start, using open-source technology to gather information on the fighting in Ukraine. He has since visited the frontlines in Eastern Ukraine and, as Russia goes on the defensive, tank-on-tank battles have so far been rare and he believes the T-55s\u2019 usage will be limited in scope.\u201cSome of those systems are probably going to be used in a rear area initially,\u201d he said. \u201cSo, not necessarily tanks going forward, but more kind of firing into a long distance.\u201dIf that is to be their purpose, Delaney believes the T-55 may still prove useful.\u201cOne of the things you can obviously use this [tank] for if you\u2019re trying to avoid a tank versus tank engagement is to dig them in, in defensive positions, sit the tank in the pit so you can only see the turret and then that can be used to defend a front line against the counterattack,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you\u2019ve been the aggressor in a war and you\u2019re suddenly about to be on the defensive, this would be effective for static defensive positions.\u201dAs Russian forces prepare to take the brunt of a widely anticipated, NATO-equipped Ukrainian offensive, they\u2019re having to rely on a conscript army, less prepared than that of their opponent.And for under-trained soldiers, the T-55 provides somethingdon\u2019t: ease of use.\u201cIf you\u2019ve got a lot of conscripts coming into your army, which you have at the moment with the Russian forces, it\u2019s going to be easier, quicker to train people to use these than it is to use a more modern model of battle tank,\u201d Delaney said.\u201cIt\u2019s really easy to maintain and with a conscript army, that\u2019s what you\u2019re looking for, you\u2019re looking for the ability to keep these things operational.\u201dUkraine, in fact, also has a version of the T-55 in its arsenal \u2013 28 highly-modernized M-55s.As Ukraine gears up for its expected spring counteroffensive, Russia has dug in. Satellite imagery has revealed the extensive defensive lines built by Moscow\u2019s forces across the regions they continue to occupy.Ukraine says it used US-made Patriot system to intercept Russian hypersonic missileLee believes a successful counteroffensive will come down to Ukrainian intelligence finding the perfect location to push through.\u201cIt\u2019s not impossible but a lot of it comes down to Ukraine finding weak points in a line and trying to narrowly penetrate,\u201d he said.And that\u2019s where modern, more advanced NATO equipment, with better armor, longer ranges and more maneuverability, could come into its own, especially when facing much older Soviet hardware.\u201cI think faced with Western weapons, the Russians must expect very heavy casualties if they expect to move forward using the T-55 system,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cIt\u2019s a move of desperation to be using weapons of that vintage.\u201dAnd though tank battles have been rare, Ukraine has an advantage if they do occur.\u201cIf you\u2019ve got a big open country and you\u2019re fighting a big, armored tank engagement over vast expanses of land, then this is at a very distinct disadvantage,\u201d Delaney said of the Russians\u2019 T-55s.\u201c(Against a Leopard or a Challenger), if it\u2019s a one-on-one tank engagement, this will lose every time.\u201d"

However, the Cuban government has a history of taking down the state-provided internet during previous protests, sometimes for several days.Cuba fuel shortages spark fistfights, queues and holiday cutbacksInternet connectivity appeared to be largely restored on Sunday, and Cuban state media Cubadebate said no more protests had occurred.Cuban officials did not say how many people had been arrested. But activist groups reported at least five people were detained by police.Cubadebate had claimed on Sunday that the \u201cunusual demonstration\u201d was \u201cinitiated by an incident involving a small group of drunk people.\u201d It blamed \u201ccounterrevolutionary media\u201d in the United States for trying to portray the protests as the beginning of a large-scale uprising against the communist-run government.Caimanera is known as \u201cthe first trench against imperialism,\u201d as the town lies just across Guantanamo Bay from the US naval base, notorious as the prisonto indefinitely await trial.The town-turned-military-zone is surrounded by guard towers, bomb shelters dug into the hillsides, concealed military encampments and miles of cactus ordered planted by late revolutionary leader Fidel Castro.Foreigners and even Cubans need special permission to visit the town because of its proximity to the US base. When CNN was able to visit Caimanera nearly five years ago, residents complained of their isolation but said the government gave them extra rations including milk and meat, considered luxuries by many Cubans.Fuel crisis in Cuba changes plans for national May Day festivitiesBut even the town hasn\u2019t been spared fromthe rest of the country, residents say in videos posted to social media.Since mid-April, Cuba has been beset with its most dire fuel shortages in years, prompting comparisons to the severe disruptions Cubans suffered after the fall of the Soviet Union.Lines stretch for blocks even at gas stations where there has been no fuel for days; late night fist fights have broken out between drivers accusing one another of cutting the line. There are also increasing scarcities of food and medicine.Cuba\u2019s government has blamed US economic sanctions for the disruptions, but also conceded in state-run media that countries which traditionally supply the island with oil have not been sending promised fuel."

        "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/business-65522169",
        "text": "US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has warned a failure to raise the US's debt ceiling could have dire consequences.Without an agreement to increase what the federal government can borrow, it could run out of money by early June.At that point the federal government might not be able to make wage, welfare and other payments.\"It's Congress's job to do this. If they fail to do it, we will have an economic and financial catastrophe that will be of our own making,\" she said.In an interview with ABC News on Sunday Ms Yellen said debt ceiling negotiations should not take place \"with a gun to the head of the American people.\"But time is running out for an agreement.On Tuesday, President Biden will meet Republican leaders to ask them to agree to raising the current $31.4tn (\u00a325.12tn) limit.Congress typically ties approval of a higher debt ceiling to stipulations on budget and spending measures.Last month the House of Representatives passed a bill to raise the ceiling, currently roughly equal to 120% of the country's annual economic output, but included in the bill sweeping spending cuts over the next decade.President Biden wants Congress to agree to raise the debt ceiling, with no conditions. President Biden has said he will not negotiate over the increase and will discuss budget cuts after the issue is resolved.Failure to find cross-party agreement on the issue could result in a \"constitutional crisis\" Ms Yellen said.The Biden administration is considering whether there is scope within the constitution for the president to continue issuing new debt without the approval of Congress, but will this week strive to avoid that scenario.\"We should not get to the point where we need to consider whether the president can go on issuing debt. This would be a constitutional crisis,\" Ms Yellen told ABC.The debt ceiling has been raised, extended or revised 78 times since 1960, often with negotiations going down to the wire.In the end, the threat of a default on government payments including debt obligations has always led to compromise. The US has never defaulted, an event that would upend global financial markets and have far-reaching economic impacts.But delaying a resolution also had negative consequences, Ms Yellen said in a letter to Congress last week.\"We have learned from past debt limit impasses that waiting until the last minute to suspend or increase the debt limit can cause serious harm to business and consumer confidence, raise short-term borrowing costs for taxpayers, and negatively impact the credit rating of the United States,\" she wrote.Yellen warns US could run out of cash in a monthWhat happens now the US has hit the debt ceiling?"

        "text": "? Technically yes. That\u2019s because if a male sovereign is married when they accede the throne, his wife is traditionally anointed and crowned in a short ceremony.That takes place afteris crowned and the homages are paid.On Saturday, Camilla became the 29th Queen Consort to be crowned at Westminster Abbey.Like her husband, she was anointed with holy oil by the Archbishop of Canterbury, this time without a screen, which demonstrates the different nature of anointing a consort compared to a reigning sovereign.The Keeper of the Jewel House then presented the Consort\u2019s Ring, which symbolizes promise and commitment, \u201cmarrying\u201d her to the King and both to God and their people.Next, she was crowned with Queen Mary\u2019s Crown, marking the first time in recent history that a new crown wasn\u2019t made specifically for this occasion.Fashion at the Coronation: What the guests woreBack when Queen Mary paid for the silver crown in 1911, her intention was for it to serve as the permanent crown of future consorts.Camilla opted to wear Queen Mary\u2019s Crown - a decision made \u201cin the interests of sustainability and efficiency,\u201d the palace said.However, she made some \u201cminor changes and additions,\u201d the palace added. Specifically, she wanted to honor her late mother-in-law by resetting the crown with some diamonds \u2013 the Cullinan III, IV and V \u2013 from the Queen\u2019s personal collection.She was then presented with the Sceptre and Rod before committing herself to life-long service supporting her husband.Finally, Camilla was enthroned.This was followed by an original composition by Andrew Lloyd Webber that set verses from Psalm 98 to music.You may have seen that she\u2019s now being titled as \u201cQueen Camilla.\u201dThere\u2019s always been a bit of sensitivity around how Camilla would be titled, particularly whether she would be known as Queen because it had been destined for.When Camilla wed Charles back in 2005, it was announced that she would be known as \u201cPrincess Consort,\u201d despite having a right to the title of Queen.But Queen Elizabeth IIbefore her death.Many wives of a sitting monarch have often been titled as Queen, with the most recent example being Elizabeth II\u2019s mother, Queen Elizabeth.Charles became King.But the first time we saw his wife titled as \u201cQueen Camilla\u201d was in the elaborate coronation invitations sent out to esteemed VIPs.So why hasn\u2019t the changeover happened until now?A royal source told CNN last month that the coronation was an appropriate time to start the transition of titles.\u201cIt made sense to refer to Her Majesty as the Queen Consort in the early months of His Majesty\u2019s reign, to distinguish from Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II,\u201d the source added.\u201cThe coronation is an appropriate time to start using \u2018Queen Camilla\u2019 in an official capacity,\u201d the royal source said. \u201cAll former Queen Consorts have been known as \u2018Queen\u2019 plus their first name.\u201d"

        "text": "This video can not be playedWatch: US releases footage from its drone of the encounter with a Russian jetThe US military has released footage of a Russian jet crashing into one of its drones over the Black Sea.The US said the damage to the large drone meant it had to be brought down into the water near Crimea on Tuesday.Russia denied its Su-27 fighter jet clipped the propeller of the drone, but the video appears to back up the American version of events.It was in the Pentagon's interest to release this video - not least to verify its version of events.The BBC has not seen the events before or after the collision. The US initially said the confrontation lasted around 30-40 minutes, but the released footage lasts for less than a minute.On Wednesday night, US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin said: \"We remain confident in the facts we've conveyed so far.\"He said then the Pentagon was looking at what video could be released. It is not unusual for militaries to take some time to declassify video footage before making it public.Mr Austin previously described Russia's actions as- and the edited video released appears to back that up.A feed from a camera fitted under the fuselage of the surveillance drone shows a Russian Su-27 making two extremely close passes while releasing what appears to be fuel as it approaches.In the first pass it seems to mire the lens of the camera. The second pass is even closer - disrupting the video feed from the remotely piloted aircraft.When the picture returns, a blade of the drone's propeller at the back of the aircraft can be seen bent out of shape.National Security Council spokesman John Kirby told the BBC's US broadcast partner CBS that it was not clear whether the Russian action was deliberate or accidental.But he said this did not matter because the moves were \"completely inappropriate, unsafe and unprofessional\".Surveillance flights would continue over the Black Sea, he said, but there was no need for military escorts, which he said were unnecessary and would put pilots at risk.Russia has claimed the drone was approaching its territory, but all we can see from the video is sea, sky and cloud.Moscow appeared to suggest on Tuesday that it had imposed a unilateral no-fly zone over the region as part of its invasion of Ukraine.Russian Ambassador to the US Anatoly Antonov said the drone had \"violated boundaries of the temporary airspace regime established for the special military operation\".But Mr Kirby said the airspace was international and not restricted.In a statement released hours after the crash, the US said Russian jets dumped fuel on the drone several times before the collision.Pentagon spokesman Brig Gen Pat Ryder told reporters the drone was \"unflyable and uncontrollable\", adding the collision also likely damaged the Russian aircraft.Russia's defence ministry said the drone crashed after a \"sharp manoeuvre\", and that it was flying with its transponders (communication devices) turned off.The Kremlin has not yet responded to the release of the US video. On Wednesday Russia's security council secretarythe remnants of the drone.On Thursday, Russian ships were seen at the site of the downed drone on the Black Sea, US media reported.Mr Kirby said the US was also searching for the aircraft, but stressed that if Russia beat them to it, \"their ability to exploit useful intelligence will be highly minimised\".That message was reiterated by General Mark Milley, America's top military general, who said the US has taken \"mitigating measures\" to ensure there was nothing of value on the downed drone.A moment fraught with dangerPentagon calls Russia's move 'unprofessional'Russia pilots reckless in drone collision - US"

        "name": "The cost of the Ukraine war for one Russian regiment",
        "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-65179074",
        "text": "Kostroma is not a bad place to go looking for the effects of the Ukraine war on Russia. For this city is home to a celebrated regiment that bears its name and has been in the forefront of all the main battles in the Kremlin's campaign against its neighbours.The 331st Guards Parachute Regiment, often called the Kostroma Airborne Regiment, has been the subject of investigations by BBC's Newsnight since shortly after last February's invasion. These have revealed the price paid by the regiment and its home community. We had confirmed 39 fatalities by April last year, 62 by late July, and now the toll has reached 94.Much of the work compiling this list has involved combing social media accounts on V'Kontakte, the Russian equivalent of Facebook, and local media reporting. We can then cross reference this with satellite and Google Street View imagery.One video discovered on V'Kontakte showed soldiers' graves at a cemetery north-east of Kostroma. The graves shown in the videos match the names of the soldiers we have collated.The actual number of 331st's dead is probably much higher. Some of the soldiers are from towns outside Kostroma, which makes tracking down information about them much more difficult. Several soldiers have been reported missing - some of these may count among the dead.When one considers those seriously wounded or taken prisoner, it's reasonable to assume that the Ukraine war has cost the regiment several hundred soldiers.The loss of life has caused much comment in Kostroma, which lies about 300km (186 miles) north-east of Moscow and has a population of around a quarter of a million. One local website noted last spring that the entire Soviet-Afghan war, lasting nine years, had cost the city 56 soldiers. Heavy losses in Ukraine have given the local authorities a difficult task of political management.Sergey Sitnikov, Kostroma's Kremlin-appointed governor, has been in the forefront of attempts to convince people that the city's soldiers are being properly supported. Gov Sitnikov's visits to hospitals, barracks, and indeed to the front, have been covered on local TV.On a visit to the front in December, Gov Sitnikov told viewers that \"we need to help [the] guys so they have decent conditions\". He had brought with him crowd-funded care packages and commercially sold drones.Gov Sitnikov is Vladimir Putin's placeman in his home region, so he's hardly a rebel or fearless teller of uncomfortable truths. But his willingness to visit the front and acknowledge shortcomings, even in a coded way, marks an interesting contrast with his boss.When local TV showed mobilised paratroopers on the 331st's parade ground six months ago, it also carried Gov Sitnikov's rather frank remarks to them: \"I'm wishing you good health, success, completion of all tasks\u2026 and that you return home alive.\"The call-up of paratroopers, part of Russia's wider mobilisation, underlines the degree to which the Ukraine campaign has exhausted the country's professional army, of which the 331st has been a showpiece. In footage of November's parade, 150 conscripts were shown before their dispatch to the front.The total size of the 331st regiment could be estimated at 1,500-1,700. When it first sent into Ukraine in February 2022, it deployed two battalion groups, giving a total of 1,000-1,200 soldiers. After taking heavy casualties in the failed attempt to reach Kyiv, the regiment was withdrawn and rebuilt in the southern Russian garrison town of Belgorod last summer.Subsequent action has seen the regiment moving around all the major flashpoints - Izyum in the early summer, Kherson later on, and now back to Donbas. By monitoring the dates given in the death announcements on Kostroma social media, it's possible to work out when (and often where) the unit was used to spearhead assaults, and the lulls when it was removed from the line to lick its wounds.  For example, a cluster of deaths in February point to elements of the 331st being engaged in Kreminna.Mark Urban reports on how the Russian 331st Regiment, and their families, are coping with Vladimir Putin's long warEach time casualty replacements - including the conscripts shown on TV in November - are brought in to replace losses, the original cadre of soldiers gets smaller, and the overall size of the unit diminishes. It may now number no more than 300-400 at the front.The losses, and indeed the return of badly wounded men, have resonated in the home community. A few weeks into the war, one user of V'Kontake exclaimed, \"Almost every day photos of our Kostroma boys get published. It sends shivers down my spine. What's happening? When will this end?\"Local media has been featuring commemorations of fallen Kostroma soldiers. In December, a TV station featured the unveiling of a plaque to Eduard Reunov, a paratrooper in the 331st who was killed in Ukraine. The style of this memorial and the language used in the report can be seen as an attempt to channel the Great Patriotic War (as the Russians call their 1941-45 fight against the Nazis), implying that today's soldiers are engaged in an equally important cause.But on social media, we've found more modern manifestations of remembrance, and even people seeking revenge. Soldiers are shown holding shells with messages scribbled on them from Reunov's former classmates, and, supposedly, his family.There's a trend seen in a few Russian garrison towns, for wives and mothers to post pictures of themselves with an absent soldier's uniform. One tearful mother of a dead paratrooper from the 331st remembers the Great Patriotic War, and adds, \"I hope there will be stories written about our guys\".Those questioning the sacrifice tend to get short shrift. \"Ukraine isn't my Motherland, our boys are dying for nothing,\" one person recently wrote on Kostroma's V'Kontakte page. Another swiftly countered, \"That's a stupid opinion. No point in writing that stuff here\".It's evident from coverage of Gov Sitnikov's activities that the authorities are trying to mollify those who are anxious about the killed and wounded. It's not clear how much support the war has from the wider Russian public, but the video we've seen suggests there's a good deal of solidarity among military families in Kostroma.The 331st's decline can also be measured in loss to machinery as well as personnel - particularly airborne infantry combat vehicles, known by the Russian initials BMD - that have been used up in successive battles.Initially, when the 331st was part of an Airborne Forces task force pushing towards Kyiv, we had difficulty identifying its vehicles in video of the fighting. A painted \"V\" was used to identify units from all of the various units in that task force, and an inverted triangle symbol with a \"3\" in the centre was also used by one other regiment apart from the 331st.As the fighting wore on, soldiers in the 331st added a further ad hoc marking to the V on their vehicles' sides - an exclamation mark painted next to the V. They may have done this precisely so their commanders could distinguish their armour from the other regiments'.Consequently we were able to identify individual BMDs from the 331st being loaded up on railcars in March 2022, following their withdrawal from Ukraine. They then reappeared in Donbas during last summer's fighting.Open source analysts have also identified at least 25 destroyed BMDs marked in this way, by combing Ukrainian military social media accounts. As with the dead soldiers, this visible loss does not represent the total, since many other BMDs belonging to the Kostroma regiment have likely been lost outside the view of Ukrainian troops.A report broadcast in February 2023 by the Russian network NTV shows an \"armoured group\" of the 331st in action in Luhansk. But it just tends to confirm the impression we've gleaned from other sources that the regiment survives as small detachments able to spearhead certain missions. From the call signs seen on camera this element consists of just three BMD armoured vehicles.So, the regiment's long war goes on. Of the war's wider effects on the Ukrainian population you will glean little from Russian media, nor is there any frank coverage of war-crime allegations.The 331st were accused of massacring hundreds of Ukrainian soldiers during fighting in 2014. For many Ukrainians, the latest Russian losses may seem like nothing more than the paratroopers getting their just deserts.Meanwhile, in Kostroma's graveyard there is plenty of evidence of the price of failure in Russia's invasion. Buried too is the regiment's reputation as \"the best of the best\", and its dreams of easy victory."

        "name": "The 40-year-old British helicopter flying in Ukraine",
        "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-65242823",
        "text": "A military helicopter donated to Ukraine by the UK government was used in the Falklands conflict more than 40 years ago, the BBC has learned. Despite its age, the Ukrainian military says the aircraft will help in the war against Russia.Flying low in the skies over southern Ukraine, the helicopter swoops and turns, following the contours of the ground. From the cockpit and open side door, the crew scan the horizon, alert for potential threats.We are on board one of two Sea King helicopters Britain has given Ukraine - the first media to gain access to the aircraft since they were delivered in recent months. Inside, the mood is serious and purposeful, the menace of Russian missiles not far away.Despite this, the four-man crew is enjoying showing off the new helicopter. They tell us how important it is for them on the battlefield, where it is used for rescuing casualties, moving troops, and carrying out reconnaissance.But why is Britain giving Ukraine such old helicopters, some of which have been flying for more than four decades?The government in Kyiv asked for modern fighter jets armed with long-range missiles to help in a much-anticipated new offensive against Russian forces.  But the UK has not given any of its Typhoon fighter jets to Ukraine - it does not have enough to spare, and it would take too long to train Ukrainian pilots to use them. There are also broader fears that giving warplanes could escalate the conflict.Instead, the UK chose to give them two helicopters that do not carry any weapons or fly particularly fast, and which are no longer used by the Royal Navy, which pensioned the Sea Kings off several years ago. One of them is so old it even saw service during the Falklands conflict, back in 1982, where it played an historic role.The answer to the choice of aircraft can also be found partly here in Ukraine. The crew are clearly passionate about their new helicopter. Co-pilot, Vasil, says the Sea King was just what Ukraine's Navy needed - a practical, reliable aircraft that can do whatever is asked of it.\"I like this helicopter because it is incredibly good for flying,\" Vasil says. \"It's one of the best for combat operations, whether transporting equipment or carrying out search and rescue. It is easy to fly even in difficult conditions.\"The Sea Kings are being used to pick up casualties needing urgent medical help, move special forces into position, and fetch and carry equipment.Vasil says one key task is searching for downed pilots, which can involve flying behind enemy lines. \"Pilots have to eject,\" he says. \"They need to be rescued. For this, we have to reach territory which is possibly not under Ukrainian control.\"He also emphasises that the Sea Kings are of a similar age to several other helicopters used by Ukraine's armed forces. As such, he and other pilots are familiar with aircraft of that vintage, making their training easier.\"It is spacious, it has good load capacity and it is economical,\" Vasil adds.Another answer to the question about the aircraft's age can be found, perhaps, at a base in southern England, where a third Sea King, which will be delivered to Ukraine in the coming weeks, is being prepared. We cannot say where the base is for security reasons, but we spoke to two Ukrainian engineers who have been there for seven months, training to repair and maintain the helicopter.One engineer, Ihor, tells me that the Sea Kings are in fact mostly new, with very little of the original helicopter remaining.\"They are old,\" he says, \"but they have gone through modernisation, and we need them very much. I believe this is just the start of our work together.\"These Sea Kings have spent much of their lives carrying out search and rescue operations - for civilians as well as service personnel - and have been familiar sights over Britain's coasts. One of the two currently in Ukraine was flown by Ralph Wickes-Sneyd in the Falklands in 1982 - he commanded the squadron of which it was part. The retired naval pilot says the helicopter played an historic role, flying through a storm on 14 June 1982 to take the commander of British land forces - Gen Jeremy Moore - to Port Stanley so he could accept the Argentine surrender. No other aircraft could fly due to the bad weather, he says.\"It was quite an interesting operation,\" Mr Wickes-Sneyd explains. \"The ceasefire hadn't been signed up to this stage, and so the aircraft was flying into Stanley competing not just with the weather, but also some still rather unfriendly Argentines.\"The pilot also revealed that the Sea King that he flew - the one now in Ukraine - was also flown in the Falklands by Prince Andrew, then serving as a young naval pilot.\"He would have flown the aircraft from time to time,\" Mr Wickes-Sneyd says. \"It was his first tour. So he did what everybody else did, which was sometimes pretty mundane, sometimes quite exciting.\"These Sea Kings may be old, they may be few in number, and they may not be the fixed wing aircraft Kyiv wants to help turn the military balance. But the navy in Ukraine says it is happy to have them - and it wants more.There are other Sea Kings in storage in the UK, and if the government decided to give them to Ukraine, the crew and engineers we spoke to said they would be more than welcome.Pilot Vasil says that getting hold of a Sea King is like replacing your old car with a classic \"foreign car\".\"It is so practical. We would like to receive more helicopters like these,\" he says.Back in England, engineer Ihor concedes new aircraft would perhaps be better, but adds: \"It's better than nothing and it's only the beginning.\"What weapons are being supplied to Ukraine?"

        "name": "Ukraine war: Bakhmut defender remembered by comrades",
        "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-65313367",
        "text": "Staff sergeant Pavel Kuzin took his position at the machine gun - the only soldier still able to fight. Everyone else in his troop lay dead or injured.Suffering from shell-shock and with one arm bandaged, the 37-year-old fired at the waves of Russian soldiers trying to storm his position. They didn't even try to take cover, but simply walked towards him across the open field.It was clear Pavel wouldn't be able to hold the position for long, but he needed to buy time for a rescue team to arrive. His final action in life was to ensure his wounded comrades got to safety.The Ukrainian military says Bakhmut is now the scene of many \"unprecedentedly bloody\" battles like this, where they now have to repel up to 50 attacks on their positions every day. Russia has concentrated massive forces in this area, and their brutal strategy of launching human wave attacks helps them to advance slowly - but at a very high cost.Pavel was in charge of a forward observation group that consisted of six Ukrainian soldiers. On 17 February, shortly after the start of their watch, they came under heavy fire. A tank began hammering their position.Unlike relentless mortar rounds, the tank's aiming was chillingly accurate. Shells were landing a few metres from their trenches. Two soldiers were wounded and Pavel told them to go into a dugout. A combat medic went down to tend to their injuries and prepare them for an evacuation. Moments later, the wooden shelter was directly hit by a shell.\"There was a bright flash,\" one of the wounded soldiers with a callsign Tsygan told the BBC. \"I was thrown onto the logs with such force that it nearly crushed me. I couldn't understand whether I was dead or alive. Someone was shouting, it seemed the sound was coming from 100m away.\"It was Pavel's voice who was checking on them. The other soldier was half-buried under dirt and logs. He was dead.Tsygan could barely move and Pavel had to drag him up over the splintered logs that blocked the way. It was painfully slow to move Tsygan just a few metres away into a nearby trench. When the shelling paused briefly, Pavel went back trying to find others.Two minesweepers arrived to clear the logs and find the bodies. But yet another shell hit the dug out, killing one of the men and injuring the other. The tank kept firing.At that moment, Russian troops started storming their position. Pavel called for a support group to evacuate the wounded and rushed back to his Browning machine gun to stop the Russian infantry.The 206th Battalion in which Pavel served had fought in the southern Kherson and north-eastern Kharkiv regions. But the battles over Bakhmut were very different from what they had seen before.\"The intensity of fighting to break through our positions was shocking,\" says Mykola Hlabets, platoon commander. \"Sometimes, [Russian soldiers] would get as close as 20 metres from us, crawling and moving under a treeline or across an open field. This is where we had our first gunfights at such proximity.\"\"They would just stand and walk towards our positions without any cover. We wiped out one group after another, but they kept coming.\"Hlabets described them as a suicide squad. Others call them cannon fodder.A number of videos have been shared on telegram channels recently where newly mobilized Russian soldiers appealed to President Vladimir Putin and the authorities to stop what they called \"illegal orders\" to send them \"to be slaughtered\".Last month mobilised soldiers from Belgorod posted a video saying that they were sent for an assault mission without proper training. After suffering heavy losses, they said they refused to carry out their orders.Often these poorly trained soldiers are reportedly forced to keep pushing forward. The assault group Storm of the 5th Brigade of the Russian army said in a video appeal that they couldn't leave their position because of zagryad otryad, or blocking troops - detachments that open fire at their own men who try to retreat.These wave attacks are similar to World War One tactics, when troops charged the enemy and engaged in close combat. And despite their lack of training and experience, sending newly recruited soldiers to such assaults are bringing some results for Russia, albeit at a very high cost.Ukrainians expose their positions when they open fire to stop those attacks. That allows Russian artillery to identify the target and destroy it, as happened with Pavel's post.Also, soldiers at forward positions run out of ammunition while trying to repel numerous wave attacks. They then become an easy target.That was the risk Pavel knew he faced as he rushed to his Browning machine gun. But as long as he kept firing, his wounded brothers-in-arms had a chance to be rescued.Tsygan was bleeding in the trench where Pavel had left him. Shrapnel had smashed his pelvis. Another piece had gone through his thigh, and a third had hit his abdomen, \"turning the internal organs upside down\", he said. He was barely conscious.\"I didn't see much, it was all white,\" he said. \"I lay on the snowy ground for two hours and I didn't feel cold or anything.\"Next to him was another wounded soldier. The rescue team on an armoured personnel carrier hastily picked them up as shelling resumed. They didn't even have time to close the hatch, Tsygan says.By that time, Pavel's machine gun had fallen silent. He died from a head wound: a piece of shrapnel had pierced his helmet.Commanders of the 206th battalion decided to send a group to retrieve the bodies of Pavel and the other soldiers.The next day in the evening, three groups of two soldiers each set off to bring the bodies back.\"The plan looked good on paper, but things quickly went wrong,\" junior sergeant Vasyl Palamarchuk, who was in the lead group, remembers. They got lost and nearly ran into Russian positions in the dark. When they got close to the dugout, Russians spotted them and opened fire from a tank.Russian tanks and artillery had continuously shelled that post in those days, but the Ukrainian big guns had largely stayed quiet. The reason was a massive shortage of shells.\"Once we counted that the Russians had fired up to 60 shells a day, whereas we could allow only two,\" Palamarchuk explains. \"They destroyed trees and everything else and you had no place to hide.\"Ukraine is struggling to find ammunition for its Soviet-era artillery. Getting shells for weapons donated by Ukraine's western partners has its own limits. As the secretary general of the Nato military alliance, Jens Stoltenberg, said recently: \"The current rate of Ukraine's ammunition expenditure is many times higher than our current rate of production.\"Palamarchuk's group eventually picked up Pavel's body just a few hours before Russian troops seized the area. Heavy snow turned into a freezing rain. After numerous breaks on the way back, crawling through craters left by shells, they finally arrived. The whole operation over just a kilometre's distance lasted for six hours.It was past midnight but the entire battalion gathered at the evacuation point to pay their respects to Pavel, who is survived by his daughter and wife.\"It was a huge loss for our unit,\" Palamarchuk says. \"He saved two people but died himself.\"Meet the hacker armies on Ukraine's cyber front line'I looked at my foot and saw I was missing toes'The Russian ships accused of North Sea sabotage"

        "text": "When Anastacia Kozmina and Oleksiyy Danko woke to the sound of bombing in February 2022, they immediately decided to leave Ukraine. They joined some eight million Ukrainian refugees faced with finding a safe place to live and work.The couple arrived in the UK where they found people to be \"warm-hearted\" and \"supportive\", but finding jobs was hard. So they started their own business.Ukraine refugees have been scattered all over the world. This is the story of how many Ukrainians are finding ways of earning a living somewhere new.In Ukraine, Anastasia worked as a lawyer; Oleksiyy was a qualified pharmacist. They also dry-cleaned furniture to make extra money.Anastacia said when the bombing began on 24 February 2022, she knew she did not want to live in a warzone.The couple had friends who had moved to England, so they put an appeal on Facebook for a sponsor - and eventually arrived in Southport, Merseyside.\"It was a really hard period for us,\" Anastacia says. \"I stopped doing my make-up, my nails, my hair... I needed six months to refresh, to understand that I am in a safe place.\"Anastacia tried to find work as a lawyer but because the UK has a different legal system she couldn't, so the couple decided to use their side-hustle skills and started a business dry-cleaning furniture.They has some leaflets printed, and were surprised to receive calls from people who wanted items cleaning, items that were not actually dirty.\"One time Oleksiyy went to clean a small sofa and this lady gave us some beautiful flowers because she wants to support us. She waned to help us, she was really warm-hearted,\" she says.They are hoping to continue to build the business: \"In England we have another life, we have an opportunity to develop ourselves, to grow,\" she says.Yulia left Ukraine three months after the war began.She found a sponsor in Nottingham and drove for three days with her two daughters and their dog. Yulia asked us not to use her surname because her husband is still in Ukraine.Back home, she ran a successful wedding-dress business and her sponsor suggested she start it up again.\"It's a crazy idea, but I think I can try... my profession is my life,\" she says.A friend of Yulia's husband, who was driving to the UK, brought over her sewing machines, fabrics and mannequins.\"It's not easy because system of business in England is different, it's not like in Ukraine,\" says Yulia.She struggled to make her wedding-dress business off the ground in the UK, so decided to use her skills and passion to find a full-time sewing job.Yulia says, although it's been disappointing not to be able to keep her business going, she is happy with her new life.\"We have a nice place, we have nice work, family... I do what I like to do, so I can say that I am lucky.\"She says with a bit more time she will try again to get her business going.Polina was preparing the children in her dance school for a competition when Russia invaded Ukraine.\"War started and everything that you planned, it doesn't make any sense,\" she says.Polina lived beside a tank factory in Lviv and quickly realised it would be a target. The following morning she left for Poland and a month later joined her sister who had been living in Canada for a few years.\"It was really difficult mentally because you are still part of Ukraine and you are here in Canada and it's very different,\" she says.\"You need to do something, you need to make your mind busy to feel better,\" she adds.Polina got a job in recruitment but her passion was for teaching dance.She rented space in a studio and started Polli's Dance, teaching Canadian children and the children of other Ukrainian refugees.\"I feel this energy exchange with kids,\" she says. \"It's something that makes me feel happy.\"Volodymyr and Regina Razumovskaya left Ukraine a year ago.They had already been forced out of their home in Donetsk when the region was seized by Russian separatists in 2014 and their business was destroyed.The couple fled to Kyiv where they set up another business selling plants.But when Russia invaded the family were forced to flee again - this time to join friends in Perth, Western Australia.\"Could you imagine just to leave your house? To leave you business? To leave your friends?\" Regina asks.\"Even [after] one year passed I just feel this fear inside, you are not sure what's going to happen.\"Regina says the welcome they received in Australia gave them the belief that they could start again.Vlodymyr now works full-time because the business in Ukraine makes just 10% of what it did before the war.Regina told us: \"When you trust that there is a future for you, you buy plants.\"The people in Ukraine now are so exhausted, so tired by the war they are losing their trust.\""

        "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-65173043",
        "text": "This video can not be playedWatch: The moment Finland hands over Nato documentsFinland has become the 31st member of the Nato security alliance, doubling the length of member states' borders with Russia.The Finnish foreign minister handed the accession document to the US secretary of state who declared Finland a member.Then in bright sunshine in front of Nato's gleaming new headquarters, Finland's white-and-blue flag joined a circle of 30 other flags.Finland's accession is a setback for Russia's Vladimir Putin.He had repeatedly complained of Nato's expansion before his full-scale invasion of Ukraine.US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said by attacking his neighbour, the Russian leader had triggered exactly what he had sought to prevent.Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov warned that Russia would be \"watching closely\" what happens in Finland, describing Nato's enlargement as a \"violation of our security and our national interests\".A military band played Finland's national anthem followed by the Nato hymn. Beyond the perimeter fence a small group of protesters waving Ukrainian flags chanted \"Ukraine in Nato\", a reminder of why non-aligned Finland had asked to join along with Sweden in May 2022.Finland shares a 1,340-km (832-mile) eastern frontier with Russia and after the war in Ukraine began Helsinki chose the protection of Nato's Article Five, which says an attack on one member is an attack on all.In effect, it means if Finland were invaded or attacked, all Nato members - including the US - would come to its aid.Russia's invasion prompted a surge in Finnish public opinion towards joining Nato to 80% in favour.\"It is a great day for Finland,\" said Finnish President Sauli Niinisto,Finland would be a reliable ally and its membership would not be a threat to anyone, he said. \"Security and stability are those elements which we feel very strongly; if people can live in secure stable circumstances that's the basic element of happy life.\"\"This will make Finland safer and Nato stronger,\" said Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg earlier, describing it as a proud day for him and the alliance.\"President Putin had a declared goal of the invasion of Ukraine to get less Nato along its borders and no more membership in Europe, he's getting exactly the opposite.\"US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said he was \"tempted to say this is maybe the one thing we can thank Mr Putin for, because he once again here has precipitated something he claims to want to prevent by Russia's aggression\".Finland brings with it a well-equipped and trained, active armed force of about 30,000 with a wartime strength of 280,000.It also provides a challenge for Nato to help keep its long border with Russia secure, but it is already being included in Nato's latest defence plans to keep the alliance secure.Sweden's application has for now become stuck, with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan accusing Stockholm of embracing Kurdish militants and allowing them to demonstrate on the streets. Hungary is also yet to approve Sweden joining.As he handed over the accession document to Mr Blinken, Finnish Foreign Minister Pekka Haavisto said he had a very important initial task: \"The task is to give to you for the deposit also our ratification for Swedish membership.\"Mr Stoltenberg said the most important thing was that Sweden joined as soon as possible and the Finnish president said he looked forward to welcoming his Nordic neighbour at Nato's next summit in Lithuania in July.Helsinki's journey to accession has lasted less than a year, and Tuesday's ceremony coincides with the 74th anniversary of Nato's founding in 1949.\"Finland's a terrific ally, very capable, shares our values and we expect a seamless transition into its proper seat at the table,\" US ambassador to Nato Julianne Smith told the BBC.The Kremlin said that Russia was being forced to take counter-measures to ensure its own security, tactically and strategically, but pointed out it had never had disagreements with Helsinki in the way that Ukraine had become \"anti-Russian\".Meanwhile, Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu said on Tuesday that Russia's short-range Iskander-M ballistic missile system had been handed over to Belarus and was capable of carrying nuclear as well as conventional weapons. Some Belarusian fighter jets were also capable of carrying nuclear weapons, he said.Jens Stoltenberg said Nato had not yet seen any changes to Russia's nuclear posture that would require any change by the alliance. He added there would be no Nato troops stationed in Finland without the consent of the government in Helsinki.Nato will now have seven members on the Baltic Sea, further isolating Russia's coastal access to St Petersburg and its small exclave of Kaliningrad.Mr Peskov told the BBC that Russia would be watching closely how Nato used Finnish territory \"in terms of basing weapons systems and infrastructure there which will be right up close to our borders, potentially threatening us\".\"Based on that, measures will be taken,\" the Kremlin spokesman said.What is Nato and why is Finland joining?Turkey's Erdogan seals deal on Finland joining NatoWho are the Nordic 'terrorists' wanted by Turkey?"

There has been no indication whether the trip will be rescheduled.\u201cThe top priority now is to stabilize Sino-US relations, avoid a downward spiral and prevent any accidents between China and the US,\u201d Qin told Burns, according to the Chinese readout. \u201cThis should be the most fundamental consensus between China and the US.\u201dA weapons stockpile and asymmetric warfare: How Taiwan could thwart an invasion by China -- with America's helpQin urged the US to \u201creflect deeply\u201d and \u201cmeet China halfway\u201d to push bilateral relations out of their current predicament.\u201c(The US) can\u2019t talk about communication on the one hand, but keep suppressing and containing China on the other hand,\u201d he said, adding that Washington must respect China\u2019s bottom lines and stop undermining its sovereignty, security and development interests \u2013 in particular on the issue of, a self-governing democracy Beijing claims as its own.Reiterating Beijing\u2019s talking points, Qin urged the US to stop the hollowing out of the \u201cone China\u201d principle and end support for \u201cTaiwan independent\u201d forces.Under Washington\u2019s longstanding \u201cone China\u201d policy, the US acknowledges Beijing\u2019s position that Taiwan is part of China, but has never officially recognized the Chinese Communist Party\u2019s claim to the democratic  island of more than 23 million. Under the Taiwan Relations Act, Washington is also bound by law to provide Taiwan with the means to defend itself.Under Xi, China has ramped up economic, diplomatic and military pressure on Taiwan in recent years, increasing fears he may one day make an attempt to follow through on his goal of \u201creunifying\u201d the island with the mainland.Monday\u2019s meeting was Qin\u2019s first with Burns since the former Chinese ambassador to the US was promoted to foreign minister in December.It also followed Burns\u2019last week that the US is \u201cready to talk\u201d to China.\u201cOur view is we need better channels between the two governments and deeper channels, and we are ready to talk,\u201d Burns said at an event at the Stimson Center, which he attended virtually.\u201cWe\u2019ve never been shy of talking, and we hope the Chinese will meet us halfway on this,\u201d he said.Beijing cut off talks with Washington on major issues, from climate change to military relations, in August last year in response to then US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2019s high-profile visit to Taipei.The two sides resumed climate talks following Xi and Biden\u2019s meeting on the sidelines of the G20 summit in Bali, Indonesia last November.Burns told the Stimson Center event that the US has been calling on China to open all of the channels suspended following Pelosi\u2019s Taiwan trip. He reiterated Blinken\u2019s visit to China would be rescheduled \u201cwhen conditions are appropriate.\u201d"

        "text": "The United Nations\u2019 nuclear watchdog has raised concerns as to the safety of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, describing the situation as \u201cincreasingly unpredictable,\u201d after Moscow ordered the evacuation of residents from Russian-occupied areas close to the facility.More than 1,600 people, including 660 children, have been evacuated from Russian-occupied towns on the front lines in Zaporizhzhia, Yevgeniy Balitskiy, the Russia-appointed acting head of Zaporizhzhia region administration, said Monday.The Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant, Europe\u2019s largest nuclear power station, is held by Russian forces but mostly operated by a Ukrainian workforce.The town of Enerhodar was among 18 settlements whose residents were evacuated over the weekend. Most of the plant\u2019s staff live in the town, the International Atomic Energy Agency director general Rafael Mariano Grossi said in a statement.Grossi said he was deeply concerned about the \u201cincreasingly tense, stressful, and challenging conditions\u201d for personnel and their families and about \u201cthe very real nuclear safety and security risks facing the plant.\u201d\u201cWe must act now to prevent the threat of a severe nuclear accident and its associated consequences for the population and the environment,\u201d Grossi warned.Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant: History, control and key developmentsThe evacuation of the town come amid rumors of an anticipated Ukrainian counteroffensive, with the southern region likely to be a major target as Kyiv seeks to push back Moscow\u2019s invasion.The site director Yuri Chernichuk said operating staff are not being evacuated and \u201care doing everything necessary to ensure nuclear safety and security at the plant.\u201dChernichuk said the plant\u2019s six reactors are all in shutdown mode and its equipment is being maintained, \u201cin accordance with all necessary nuclear safety and security regulations,\u201d according to Grossi.The plant\u2019s position on the front lines \u2013 located on the eastern bank of the Dnipro river \u2013 means shelling in the surrounding towns and near the facility is common, according to local reports.It has frequently been disconnected from Ukraine\u2019s power grid due to intense Russian shelling in the area, repeatedly raising fears across Europe of a nuclear accident.The plant is also significant because Ukraine relies heavily on nuclear power. Should Russia keep it, Ukraine would lose 20% of its domestic electricity generating capacity.Russia would want to capture the plant undamaged, with hopes of serving its own electricity market.The IAEA said experts at the site continue to hear shelling on a regular basis, including late on Friday.The evacuations, which began in Zaporizhzhia on Friday, were a \u201cnecessary measure\u201d due to \u201cintensified shelling of settlements\u201d close to the front line, said Yevgeny Balitsky, the Russian-appointed acting governor of the partially occupied region.Local Telegram channels reported sightings of evacuation buses and authorities telling residents to pack their bags and take their children out of kindergartens.Evacuated residents were being placed in temporary accommodation and included children of elementary school age, Balitskiy said. He claimed the evacuees \u201chave everything they need: food, a place to sleep, constant contact and consultation with specialists.\u201dUkrainian officials have charged that Russian forces have used evacuations as a means to forcibly deport Ukrainians.Natalia Humeniuk, spokesperson for Ukraine\u2019s Operational Command South, told local media the evacuations were \u201can imitation of care for the local residents.\u201dAnalysis: Ukraine says it stopped a missile Russia said was unstoppableShe said this was a standard practice previously used by the Russians.\u201cThey are trying to evacuate the people to the places where they set up their own defense lines and where they are setting their units in order to use local civilians as a cover,\u201d Humeniuk said.Her comments came as the exiled Ukrainian mayor of Melitopol, Ivan Fedorov, claimed Russian soldiers are trying to leave Zaporizhzhia disguised as civilians.\u201cThere are soldiers who try to escape from the temporarily occupied territories,\u201d Fedorov said in an interview with Ukrainian media Sunday.\u201cOur residents report some cases of Russian soldiers dressing up in civilian clothes. One of the purposes why they do this is to run from the temporarily occupied territory.\u201dHowever, Fedorov also said Russian troops \u201care moving more and more to the Zaporizhzhia frontline.\u201dMeanwhile, Ukrainian military officials reported Sunday that Russian forces continued to shell the region, but with no casualties in the past 24 hours.On Sunday, Ukraine\u2019s Operation Command South spokeswoman said Russian forces were trying to exhaust Ukraine\u2019s air defense system.\u201cThey are trying to find a way around it. And they are also expanding their tactics because they do not have a stable stock of the means that they can operate with,\u201d Humeniuk said, adding the Russians are also trying \u201cto test and find out where the air defense systems are located.\u201dEarly Monday, five people were wounded in Kyiv following Russian drone attacks on districts of the Ukrainian capital overnight, according to Serhiy Popko, the head of Kyiv City Military Administration (KCMA)Wagner boss suggests his forces may stay in Bakhmut after threatening to withdrawIn the south, Russia launched eight missiles at the port city of Odesa overnight Sunday, Ukraine\u2019s air force said.Russian missile attacks were also recorded in Kharkiv, Kherson and Mykolaiv regions, according to Ukraine\u2019s military.And in Ukraine\u2019s east, the head of the Wagner mercenary group claimed its troops have advanced in the embattled city of Bakhmut.Wagner chief Yevgeny Prigozhin said Sunday his forces have advanced in \u201cdifferent directions so far,\u201d though the Ukrainians still control 2.37 square kilometers.Prigozhin has nowafter Russia\u2019s Ministry of Defense promised to provide them with more ammunition, apparently backtracking on a threat to withdraw.Bakhmut has been the site of a months-long assault by Russian forces that has driven thousands from their homes and left the area devastated.But, despite the vast amounts of manpower and resources Russia has poured into capturing Bakhmut, Moscow\u2019s forces have suffered high casualties and been unable to take total control of the city.CNN\u2019s Maria Kostenko, Josh Pennington, Olga Voitovych and Tim Lister contributed reporting."

Several opposition lawmakers and human rights groups have condemned the police\u2019s actions.Graham Smith, the chief executive of Britain\u2019s largest anti-monarchist group, Republic, was among those arrested. Speaking on BBC Radio 4 he said suggestions that the arrests were necessary was \u201cdisgraceful.\u201d\u201cThey stopped us because the law was introduced, rushed in last week, to give them the powers to stop us on any flimsy pretext,\u201d he said Monday.\u201cThat law means we no longer in this country have the right to protest, we only have the freedom to protest contingent on the permission of senior police officers and politicians and it\u2019s my view that those senior police officers were under immense pressure from politicians,\u201d he added.However, a senior UK government minister defended the actions of the Metropolitan Police during the anti-monarchy protests in London on Saturday, saying officers had to make \u201ctough calls.\u201dUK culture secretary Lucy Frazer said that, while the right to protest remains \u201creally important\u201d in a democracy, tactics by demonstrators have shifted in recent years to interrupt people going about their daily lives.Frazer told the BBC the police were tasked with balancing people\u2019s right to protest with overseeing an international event on the world stage.Thousands gathered in central London on Saturday to celebrate the once-in-a-generation occasion. But it also drew demonstrators, with protesters wearing yellow T-shirts booing and shouting \u201cNot My King\u201d throughout the morning.Labour lawmaker Chris Bryant posted on Twitter Saturday: \u201cFreedom of speech is the silver thread that runs through a parliamentary constitutional monarchy.\u201dJess Phillips, also a Labour lawmaker, said on Twitter: \u201cOur nation and our King is not so fragile as to not be able to take harmless protest of a different view.\u201dUK director of Human Rights Watch, Yasmine Ahmed, described the police\u2019s actions as alarming and \u201csomething you would expect to see in Moscow, not London.\u201dThe MET police statement said the arrests were \u201cfor various offences including breach of the peace and conspiracy to cause a public nuisance\u201d, including \u201creligiously aggravated offence\u201d, \u201cpossession of class A drugs\u201d, \u201cconspiracy to cause a public nuisance,\u201d \u201cbreach of the peace\u201d and \u201cracially aggravated public order offence.\u201dDefending the force\u2019s actions,Commander Karen Findlay said that, while they \u201cabsolutely understand public concern,\u201d police also \u201chave a duty to intervene when protest becomes criminal and may cause serious disruption.\u201dMembers of environmental activist group Just Stop Oil were also arrested on The Mall outside Buckingham Palace, the UK\u2019s PA Media news agency reported, adding that a large group of the protesters were seen in handcuffs.According to PA, Animal Rising said some of its supporters were apprehended on Saturday while at a training session \u201cmiles away from the coronation.\u201d A spokesman for the campaign group, Nathan McGovern, described the arrests as \u201cnothing short of a totalitarian crackdown on free speech and all forms of dissent.\u201dCNN\u2019s Niamh Kennedy, Christian Edwards, Lindsay Isaac, Allegra Goodwin and  Xiaofei Xu contributed to this report."

        "text": "Violence has gripped the northeaststate of, as unrest between ethnic groups saw buildings set ablaze and charred vehicles strewn across roads, leaving.Officials\u2019 repeated pleas for calm have appeared futile, prompting the Indian army to deploy troops in a bid to restore law and order, and authorities blocking internet access for the state\u2019s approximately 3 million population.Residents of Manipur say there has been a breakdown of law and order. The state\u2019s government, led by India\u2019s Hindu-nationalist ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), last week issued \u201cshoot-at-sight\u201d orders for \u201cextreme\u201d cases, while the army said Sunday it has \u201csignificantly enhanced\u201d its surveillance in the state.Authorities say they are bringing the situation under control, but as the unrest enters its second week, the situation remains hostile in a complex, ethnically diverse and disparate region, that has for decades grappled with insurgencies, violence and marginalization.Here\u2019s what you need to know.Manipur, a lush, hilly state which borders Myanmar, has long history of civil conflict since modern India\u2019s creation. The state is home to an ethnically diverse group of Sino-Tibetan communities, each with their own unique language, culture and religion.Like Kashmir in the north, it was once a princely state under British rule, and only incorporated into India in 1949 \u2013 two years after the country gained independence from its former colonizers.Many within the state disagreed with that move, feeling it was hurried and completed without a proper consensus. The region has grappled with violent insurgencies as well as ethnic conflict ever since, resulting in hundreds of deaths and injuries over the decades.The current outbreak of violence is some of the worst in recent decades.Skirmishes broke out in the state capital Imphal on May 3 after thousands of people from the Naga and Kuki tribes took part in a rally against the majority Meitei ethnic group being afforded special status under India\u2019s \u201cScheduled Tribe\u201d grouping.The Meitei community, a largely Hindu ethnic group who account for about 50% of the state\u2019s population, have for years campaigned to be recognized as a scheduled tribe, which would give them access to wider benefits including health, education and government jobs.Scheduled tribes have been among the most socio-economically disadvantaged groups in India and have historically been denied access to education and job opportunities, prompting the government to officially recognize certain groups in a bid correct years of injustice.If the Meitei community are given scheduled tribe status, other ethnic groups \u2013 many of whom are Christian \u2013 say they fear they will not have a fair chance for jobs and other benefits.The clashes turned violent, with video and photos showing angry mobs setting properties on fire. Eyewitnesses told CNN that homes and churches have been burnt, as frightened families desperately try to flee affected areas.One youth tribal leader in Imphal who spoke to CNN on the condition of anonymity said his house was ransacked and vandalized, forcing him to stay in an army camp.\u201cWhat we are witnessing here unfortunately is there seems to be a very systematic, well-planned series of attacks. The execution is almost clinical and they know exactly the houses where people from tribal communities reside,\u201d said the leader.\u201cI barely escaped\u2026 the mob was already in the house. I climbed the fence over to the neighbors\u2019 house. I just came with my laptop bag to this camp. I don\u2019t have anything.\u201dThe divide between the Meiteis and the other ethnic groups is cut sharply across political and geographic lines.While last week\u2019s protests appear to have sparked the recent violence, tensions between the two groups have been simmering for years over a complex range of issues, including land rights and a crackdown on minority groups.The Meteis dominate positions within the state government, and have been privy to more economic and infrastructural advancement than the other ethnic groups.They mostly live in the more developed but geographically smaller Imphal Valley, while the Naga and Kuki groups live predominantly in agriculturally rich and geographically larger.The Naga and Kuki groups fear the change in status could result in their steady removal from a protected area they have occupied for decades and leave them vulnerable to exploitation.Moreover, tensions in Manipur have increased since the bloody 2021 coup in neighboring Myanmar, after thousands of ethnically Chin people fled the violent crackdown by the Burmese military.The Kukis, who are from the same ethnic group as the Chins, say the government has unfairly cracked down the group since their arrival, leading to feelings of persecution and abandonment.Manipur\u2019s chief minister N.Biren Singh hashe is \u201cconstantly in touch\u201d with India\u2019s Home Minister Amit Shah to monitor the situation, adding the situation \u201ccontinues to improve and normalcy returns.\u201dShah on MondayIndian news outlet India Today that the situation was under control. \u201cThere is no need for any person or group to be fearful,\u201d he said.Modi, who is in the southern Indian state of Karnataka to campaign for state elections, is yet to speak publicly about the unrest, sparking widespread anger among Manipur\u2019s residents.Authorities in northeast India give 'shoot-at-sight' orders after violent skirmishes over tribal rightsOpposition politicians have accused Modi and his BJP of poor governance.\u201cAs the Manipur violence persists, all right-thinking Indians must ask themselves what happened to the much-vaunted good governance we had been promised,\u201d Shashi Tharoor, a lawmaker from the opposition Congress party, wrote on Twitter.CNN has reached out to the state and federal governments but is yet to receive a response.Many people have fled into neighboring states, including Mizoram, Meghalaya and Nagaland. Governments from other Indian states have been arranging special flights for their residents to be airlifted to safety.The Indian military said that about 23,000 civilians have fled the fighting, with displaced people being housed on military bases and garrisons in the state. In a statement on May 7, it said that there was a \u201cray of hope\u201d and a lull in the fighting due to the rescue work carried out by the 120-125 Army and Assam Rifles, which had been \u201cworking tirelessly\u2026 to rescue civilians across all communities, curb violence and restore normalcy.\u201dWhile levels of violence are not as widespread as last week, pockets of skirmishes continue to break out in some parts of the state.Over 50 dead, hundreds hospitalized and 23,000 displaced by ethnic violence in India's ManipurPhotos and video shared with CNN show some Kuki settlements barricading themselves from attacks, using wooden poles as a makeshift gate.

        "text": "More than 20,000 Russian soldiers have been killed in fighting in Ukraine since December, the US estimates.A further 80,000 have been wounded, National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said, citing newly declassified intelligence.Half of the dead are from the Wagner mercenary company, who have been attacking the eastern Bakhmut city.Russia has been trying to take the small city since last year in a grinding war of attrition.Moscow currently holds most of Bakhmut, but Ukrainian troops still control a small portion of the city in the west. The fierce battle has taken on huge symbolic importance for both sides.Ukrainian officials have also said they are using the battle to kill as many of Russia's troops as possible and wear down its reserves.\"Russia's attempt at an offensive in the Donbas [region] largely through Bakhmut has failed,\" Mr Kirby told reporters. \"Russia has been unable to seize any real strategic and significant territory.\"We estimate that Russia has suffered more than 100,000 casualties, including over 20,000 killed in action,\" he added.The toll in Bakhmut accounts for losses since the start of December, according to the US figures.\"The bottom line is that Russia's attempted offensive has backfired after months of fighting and extraordinary losses,\" Mr Kirby said.He added he was not giving estimates of Ukrainian casualties because \"they are the victims here. Russia is the aggressor\".The BBC is unable to independently verify the figures given and Moscow has not commented.The capture of the city would bring Russia slightly closer to its goal of controlling the whole of Donetsk region, one of four regions in eastern and southern Ukraine annexed by Russia last September following referendums widely condemned outside Russia as a sham.Analysts say Bakhmut has little strategic value, but has become a focal point for Russian commanders, who have struggled to deliver any positive news to the Kremlin.The Wagner mercenary group - which widely uses convicts and has become notorious for its often inhumane methods - has taken centre stage in the Russian assault on Bakhmut.Its leader, Yevgeny Prigozhin, has staked his reputation, and that of his private army, on seizing the city.But he recently threatened to pull his troops out of Bakhmut.In a rare in-depth interview to a prominent Russian war blogger, he vowed to withdraw Wagner fighters if they were not provided with much-needed ammunition by the Russian defence ministry.Wagner fighters could be redeployed to Mali, he warned.He has often clashed with Russia's defence ministry during the war, accusing officials of not providing his fighters with enough support.Mr Prigozhin also called upon the Russian media and military leadership to \"stop lying to the Russian population\" ahead of an expected Ukrainian spring counteroffensive.\"We need to stop lying to the Russian population, telling them everything is all right,\" he said.He praised the Ukrainian military's \"good, correct military operations\" and command.A top Ukrainian general said on Monday that counterattacks had ousted Russian forces from some positions in Bakhmut, but the situation remained \"difficult\".New Russian units, including paratroopers and fighters from Wagner, are being \"constantly thrown into battle\" despite taking heavy losses, Gen Oleksandr Syrskyi, the commander of Ukraine's ground forces, said on Telegram.\"But the enemy is unable to take control of the city,\" he said.Killed holding off waves of Russians in BakhmutWhat the leaked Pentagon files showThe 40-year-old UK helicopter flying in Ukraine"

        "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-65238951",
        "text": "A cache of classified US documents leaked online sheds new light on American intelligence gathered about other countries.Images of the covert files have appeared on messaging app Discord since early March.Complete with timelines and dozens of military acronyms, the documents, some marked \"top secret\", paint a detailed picture of the war in Ukraine and also offer information on China and allies.Pentagon officials are quoted as saying the documents are real.BBC News and other news organisations have reviewed the documents and these are some of the key findings.The US believed the UN secretary general's stance on a key grain deal was undermining attempts to hold Russia accountable for the war in Ukraine.Antonio Guterres was too willing to accommodate Russian interests, according to files which suggest Washington has been closely monitoring him.Several documents describe private communications involving Mr Guterres and his deputy.One leaked document focuses on the Black Sea grain deal, brokered by the UN and Turkey in July following fears of a global food crisis.It suggests that Mr Guterres was so keen to preserve the deal that he was willing to give in to Russia's demands - a stance which was \"undermining broader efforts to hold Russia accountable\".While the bulk of the leaked documents concern, in one way or another, the war in Ukraine, there are others that touch on a huge range of unrelated issues. Many of them shed light on some of Washington's global preoccupations.Like the spread and purpose of Chinese technology.Three documents based on intelligence from late February detail discussions among senior Jordanian officials over whether or not to shut the Chinese firm Huawei out of its 5G rollout plans.Jordan's Crown Prince Hussein, in charge of the rollout, is said in the document to be worried about retaliation from China if they keep Huawei out.Nor is this the only place where fears about Chinese technology are revealedAnother document marked top secret addresses China's \"developing cyber-attack capabilities.\" It says these are designed \"to deny, exploit, and hijack satellite links and networks as part of its strategy to control information, which it considers to be a key warfighting domain.\"Newly discovered documents suggest Russian officials are at loggerheads over the reporting of casualties.The main intelligence agency, the FSB, has \"accused\" the country's defence ministry of playing down the human impact of the war, the files show.These findings show the extent to which the US agencies have penetrated the Russian intelligence and military.One document, dated 23 March, refers to the presence of a small number of Western special forces operating inside Ukraine, without specifying their activities or location. The UK has the largest contingent (50), followed by Latvia (17), France (15), the US (14) and the Netherlands (1).Western governments typically refrain from commenting on such sensitive matters, but this detail is likely to be seized upon by Moscow, which has in recent months argued that it is not just confronting Ukraine, but Nato as well.Other documents say when a dozen new Ukrainian brigades - being prepared for an offensive that could begin within weeks - will be ready. They list, in great detail, the tanks, armoured vehicles and artillery pieces that are being provided by Ukraine's Western allies.One map includes a timeline that assesses ground conditions across eastern Ukraine as spring progresses.According to the Washington Post newspaper, one document from early February expresses misgivings about Ukraine's chances of success in its forthcoming counteroffensive, saying that problems with generating and sustaining sufficient forces could result in \"modest territorial gains\".Ukraine's difficulties in maintaining its vital air defences are also analysed, with warnings from late February that Kyiv might run out of critical missiles.This video can not be playedWatch: The Pentagon leaks explained in under 60 seconds.Casualty figures are also listed. One slide refers to as many as 223,000 Russian soldiers killed or wounded, and as many as 131,000 Ukrainians.Some Ukrainian officials have dismissed the leaks, suggesting they might constitute a Russian disinformation campaign. But there are signs of frustration and anger too.One presidential advisor, Mykhailo Podolyak, tweeted: \"We need less contemplation on 'leaks' and more long-range weapons in order to properly end the war.\"The Washington Post obtained access to another document from mid-February, where they found that Egypt had plans to produce 40,000 rockets for Russia in secret.The Post said President Abdul Fatah al-Sisi told officials to keep production and shipment secret \"to avoid problems with the West\".An official is quoted as saying he would \"order his people to work shift work if necessary because it was the least Egypt could do to repay Russia for unspecified help earlier\".It is unclear what the earlier help refers to. In January, Reuters reported that Russia's share of Egyptian wheat imports had risen in 2022, offering one possible explanation.There is no indication that Egypt - a recipient of US security assistance, worth around $1bn a year - went ahead with the proposed sale to Russia.An unnamed official quoted on Egyptian news channels described the allegation as \"utterly baseless\" and said Cairo did not take sides in the war.The Kremlin called it \"just another canard\" and the White House said there was \"no indication\" Egypt was providing lethal weapons to Russia.This video can not be playedExpert: US and Egypt ready to move forward after leakA classified document, seen by the BBC, reveals that South Korea was torn about selling weapons for use in Ukraine.The report, based on signals intelligence, details a sensitive conversation between national security advisers.They are torn between US pressure to send ammunition to Ukraine and their policy not to arm countries at war.One of the advisers suggests sending the shells to Poland instead, to avoid appearing to have given in to the US.As part of a resupply deal last year, Seoul insisted that the US could not pass the shells on to Ukraine. Seoul has been reluctant to arm Ukraine, for fear of antagonising Russia.The leak has triggered security concerns in Seoul, with opposition politicians questioning how the US was able to intercept such a high-level conversation.The Post also found that Beijing tested one of its experimental missiles - the DF-27 hypersonic glide vehicle - on 25 February.The missile flew for 12 minutes over a distance of 2,100km (1,300 miles), according to the documents.What does the huge leak of Ukraine war documents tell us?US leak shows S Korea torn on sending Ukraine weapons"

        "text": "The war with Ukraine has split Russia's artistic community.Those who support it have enjoyed government backing, but those who oppose it have come under huge pressure to toe the line.Speaking out comes at a price in Russia., and if you are a person of culture, you can also be frozen out of key platforms and venues.Andrei Makarevichis one of the best-known performers to fall from favour after criticising government policies in Vladimir Putin's Russia.He rose to prominence during the Soviet era as the frontman of a rock group called Mashina Vremeni (Time Machine). State TV once called him \"a Beatle of Perestroika\", referring to Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev's wide-ranging programme of reforms.But over time Makarevich grew increasingly critical of President Putin. After Russia's initial invasion of Ukraine in 2014, Makarevich wrote a song titled My Country Has Gone Mad and attended anti-war rallies. After this, a string of his concerts across Russia were cancelled, and Makarevich accused the Kremlin of orchestrating a campaign of persecution.After the start of the full-scale war in February 2022, Makarevich left Russia a deeply disillusioned man. \"People have turned out to be much easier to manipulate. More ignorant and aggressive,\" he said in an interview.Nikolai Rastorguyev, on the other hand, is an example of a performer favoured by the state. He is the lead singer of Lyube, which is often described as \"Putin's favourite band\". He is a vocal supporter of the Kremlin's policies including the \"special military operation\" in Ukraine.Unlike Makarevich, Rastorguyev appears to have enjoyed easy access to Russia's best venues for years.On 15 March 2014, the day Makarevich was nearly assaulted by anti-Ukraine activists following a peace march in Moscow, Lyube celebrated its 25th anniversary at the capital's Olympic Stadium.The following day, his band performed in Crimea in support of a vote that had no international recognition but was used by the Kremlin to justify its annexation of the Ukrainian region.Rastorguyev and his band have played at Kremlin-organised mass rallies held at Russia's largest stadium, Luzhniki, and attended by President Putin. It has also authored a song celebrating a bridge linking annexed Crimea to Russia.In a sign of the band's influence, police searching for political subversives have even forced patrons at a bar in Moscow to sing a Lyube song, as proof that they support the government.Nikolai Rastorguyev is subject to EU sanctions imposed for their role in \"the Kremlin's disinformation and information manipulation ecosystem\".In Russia, numerous performers critical of the Kremlin, such as Makarevich, have been officially designated as \"foreign agents\".Divisions run deep among stars of film and theatre, too.Nikita Mikhalkovis one of Russia's most celebrated actors and film directors. One of the pinnacles of his career is Oscar-winning drama Burnt By The Sun (1994), which he both directed and starred in. The film is about lives wrecked by terror in the USSR under Soviet leader Stalin.Mikhalkov's views are also very close to the Kremlin's official ideology: he is a religious conservative, and he espouses extreme anti-Western views.He shares these conspiracy theories in his TV show(Exorcist), which is aired on state television and is said to number President Putin among its viewers.Mikhalkov is an ardent supporter of Vladimir Putin.In 2007, he co-authored an open letter calling on the Russian president to seek a third presidential term in violation of the constitution. The same year, Mikhalkov made a film celebrating Putin's 55th birthday, which was shown on the day by state TV.The film director has headed Russia's Union of Film-Makers since 1997, and he has received numerous awards and funding from the state, including the Defence Ministry's award for \"developing the Fatherland's culture and art\", and $2m in state funding for a sequel to Burnt By The Sun.He has supported Russia's war on Ukraine in 2022, parroting the president's rhetoric that Ukraine is ruled by a \"Nazi regime\" and that the very Ukrainian language is a manifestation of hatred towards Russia.Months after the invasion started, Vladimir Putin awarded Mikhalkov the title of a \"Hero of Labour\" at a ceremony in the Kremlin. Thanking the president, the film-maker referred to the fighting in Ukraine and said that \"a new Russia\" was being forged there.For his role in spreading \"Kremlin propaganda narratives\", Mikhalkov has been sanctioned by the EU.ActressLiya Akhedzhakovaholds very different political views, and her career has followed a different trajectory. She rose to fame in the 1970s thanks to roles in hugely popular Soviet films such as The Irony of Fate and Office Romance, as well as numerous performances at Sovremennik, one of Moscow's best theatres.Since the break-up of the USSR, the diminutive actress has never shied away from making her political views public, and has often been harshly critical of government policies.At a rally in Moscow in 2014, she praised the so-called Euromaidan - protests in Kyiv that led to the toppling of pro-Russian President Viktor Yanukovych and Russia's initial invasion of Ukraine.There was applause and chants of support as Akhedzhakova urged the crowd to honour the pro-democracy demonstrators killed in the Ukrainian capital.By the time President Putin had launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine eight years later, rallies like this were unimaginable in Russia. Speaking on the day of the invasion to independent Dozhd TV, Akhedzhakova urged fellow performers and celebrities to oppose it.\"I'm calling on all people of culture - the time has come to speak out. We have to speak out. We won't get another chance. A war is going on, and there are so many lies, a whole sea of lies,\" she said.Less than a week later, Dozhd was forced to relocate abroad due to tightening censorship and concerns for the welfare of its staff.A year later, Akhedzhakova lost her last role at Sovremennik after 45 years of working at the theatre. According to the actress, the theatre's newly appointed director told her it had been \"inundated\" with letters criticising her - a practice reminiscent of state-orchestrated persecution campaigns in the Soviet Union.In another echo of Stalinism, a pro-government activist recently asked prosecutors to check if the actress was guilty of treason.Jail, poison or exile?

Mr Putin was not in the building at the time.Ukraine has accused Moscow of staging the incident in order to escalate the war.Even though Russian attacks have continued unabated - 21 people were killed on Wednesday in the Kherson region in the south - there is no sign yet of an intensification on Moscow's part.However, on Sunday evening a drone was shot down over the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, not too far from the presidential office. Officials later admitted it had been a Ukrainian drone that had \"lost control\" and been destroyed to avoid \"undesirable consequences\".According to President Putin's spokesman, the attack on the Kremlin - a large government complex in central Moscow - occurred early on Wednesday. Footage on social media showed smoke rising over the complex. A second video showed a small explosion above the site's Senate building, while two men appear to clambered up the dome.On Thursday, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the US was \"undoubtedly\" behind the alleged attack, without providing evidence.\"Decisions on such attacks are not made in Kyiv, but in Washington,\" Mr Peskov said.In his response, Mr Kirby told US media: \"Peskov is just lying there, pure and simple.\"This video can not be playedWatch: Steve Rosenberg on Russian media's muted response to the Kremlin explosion\"The United States has nothing to do with it. We don't even know exactly what happened here, but I can assure you the United States had no role in it whatsoever.\"The US official said Washington did not encourage or enable Ukraine to strike outside its borders, and did not endorse attacks on individual leaders.Ukraine has said that the alleged attack was a false flag operation by Moscow.On the other hand, though, many argue that Russia would have little interest in staging an attack that made the Kremlin look vulnerable.The latest Kremlin claims came as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky visited the International Criminal Court (ICC) in The Hague in the Netherlands.In a speech afterwards, he called for the creation of a special tribunal to hold Russia's \"crimes of aggression\" to account.He said Mr Putin \"deserves to be sentenced for criminal actions in the capital of international law\", the Ukrainian president said.He listed alleged war crimes by Russia - including the \"millions\" of strikes in the Donbas region in eastern Ukraine and those killed during the occupation of Bucha, near the capital Kyiv, at the onset of the full-scale Russian invasion last year.The ICC has issued an arrest warrant for President Putin for alleged war crimes in Ukraine. It says he is responsible for war crimes during the Ukraine war, which includes the unlawful deportation of children from Ukraine to Russia.

        "text": "Russia has sparked a \"mad panic\" as it evacuates a town near the contested Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, a Ukrainian official says.Russia has told people to leave 18 settlements in the Zaporizhzhia region, including Enerhodar near the plant, ahead of Kyiv's anticipated offensive.The Ukrainian mayor of Melitopol, Ivan Fedorov, said there were five-hour waits as thousands of cars left.The UN's nuclear watchdog warned a \"severe nuclear accident\" could occur.Speaking to the BBC's Newshour programme Rafael Grossi - the director of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) - said the evacuation of residents near the nuclear facility indicated the possibility of heavy fighting between Russian and Ukrainian forces around the plant.Although its reactors were not producing electricity they were still loaded with nuclear material, he said.Mr Grossi added that he had had to travel through a minefield when he visited the plant a few weeks ago.Earlier, the IAEA warned in a statement that situation at the Zaporizhzhia facility was \"becoming increasingly unpredictable and potentially dangerous\".Operating staff were still at the site but there was \"deep concern about the increasingly tense, stressful, and challenging conditions for personnel and their families\".It said IAEA experts at the plant had \"received information that the announced evacuation of residents from the nearby town of Enerhodar - where most plant staff live - has started\".On Friday, the Russian-installed regional head Yevgeny Balitsky said that \"in the past few days, the enemy has stepped up shelling of settlements close to the front line\".\"I have therefore made a decision to evacuate first of all children and parents, elderly people, disabled people and hospital patients,\" he wrote on social media. .The IAEA has issued warnings previously about safety at the plant - which Russia captured in the opening days of its invasion last year - after shelling caused temporary power cuts.In March the IAEA warned the plant was running on diesel generators to keep vital cooling systems going, after damage to power lines.Since Russia launched its invasion in February 2022 the number of staff at the plant has declined, the IAEA says, \"but site management has stated that it has remained sufficient for the safe operation of the plant\".Russian forces occupy much of the Zaporizhzhia region but not the regional capital Zaporizhzhia, which lies just north-east of Enerhodar across the Dnipro reservoir.On Sunday, the Ukrainian general staff said civilians were being evacuated to the cities of Berdyansk and Prymorsk, further inside Russian-held territory.The exiled mayor of Melitopol, Ivan Fedorov, wrote on Telegram that shops in the evacuated areas had run out of goods and medicine.He also said hospitals were discharging patients into the street amid fears that electricity and water supplies could be suspended if Ukraine attacks the region.And he claimed that two-thirds of evacuation convoys - allegedly made up of civilians - consisted of retreating Russian troops. The BBC cannot verify this claim.\"The partial evacuation they announced is going too fast, and there is a possibility that they may be preparing for provocations and (for that reason) focusing on civilians,\" Mr Fedorov added.How risky is stand-off over Ukraine's nuclear plant?Preparing for the worst at Ukraine nuclear plant"

        "text": "A Russian pro-war writer who was seriously injured in a car bombing said he would not be intimidated by the apparent attempt on his life.Zakhar Prilepin, a vehement supporter of Russia's campaign in Ukraine, said he survived because he was driving.The bomb was under the passenger seat, and killed his friend Alexander Shubin, he wrote in a Telegram post.Investigators claim that a suspect, Alexander Permyakov, has admitted working for Ukraine.Initial reports suggested that Prilepin had been in the passenger seat and his driver had been killed, but Prilepin said he had been driving himself.The explosion broke both his legs, he said - and added that he had dropped off his daughter \"five minutes before\".\"You will not intimidate anyone,\" he warned those behind the attack. \"Thanks to everyone who prayed, because it should have been impossible to survive such an explosion,\" he added.The prize-winning author and veteran of Moscow's bloody wars in Chechnya is one of Russia's most celebrated writers, and before 2014 was a vocal critic of President Vladimir Putin.But in recent years Prilepin - long known for his involvement in Russian ultranationalist politics - has seemingly reconciled with Mr Putin and become a strident supporter of the Ukraine invasion.The 47-year-old has admitted fighting alongside pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine and has called for the \"return of Kyiv to Russia\".Last year a group founded by Prilepin called on officials to \"purge the cultural space\" of all who oppose the conflict.Russia's Investigative Committee (SK), which handles serious crimes including terrorism, accuses Alexander Permyakov of having detonated a remote-controlled bomb, wrecking Prilepin's Audi.The SK says he was caught in a neighbouring village. The region is more than 425km (265 miles) east of Moscow.He \"admitted doing an assignment for the Ukrainian secret services\", the SK alleges.The partisan group Atesh, which is made up of Ukrainians and Crimean Tartars, claimed it was behind the attack on Prilepin.\"We had a feeling that sooner or later he would be blown up,\" they wrote on Telegram. \"He was not driving alone, but with a surprise on the underside of the car.\"The BBC cannot verify Atesh's claims.Ukraine's security service (SBU) issued its standard response, declining to comment on the attack or to a Russian foreign ministry allegation that Ukraine - backed by the US government - targeted Prilepin.The attack is the latest to target high-profile supporters of President Vladimir Putin's war in Ukraine.Vladlen TatarskyThe blogger had reported from the Ukraine front line and gained notoriety last year after posting a video filmed inside the Kremlin in which he said: \"We will defeat everyone, we will kill everyone, we will rob everyone as necessary. Just as we like it.\"Activist Darya Trepova, 26, was later arrested and was charged with terrorism following the publication of a video - believed to have been recorded under duress - in which she admitted bringing a statuette to the caf\u00e9 that later blew up.And in August 2022, Darya Dugina - the daughter of a close ally of Mr Putin -It is thought her father, the Russian ultra-nationalist philosopher Alexander Dugin, who is known as \"Putin's brain\", may have been the intended target of that attack.Daughter of Putin ally killed in Moscow blastKilling of pro-Kremlin blogger investigated as murderThe moments leading up to St Petersburg cafe blast"

Russia has been accused of using them before.Russia has been trying to capture Bakhmut for months, despite its questionable strategic value. Western officials have estimated that thousands of Moscow's troops have died in the assault.Writing on Twitter, Ukraine's defence ministry said the attack had targeted \"unoccupied areas of Bakhmut with incendiary ammunition\".It is unclear when it took place. But the footage shared by Ukraine - seemingly captured by a surveillance drone - showed high-rise buildings engulfed in flames.Other videos posted to social media showed fires raging on the ground and white clouds illuminating the night sky.A BBC analysis of the video posted by the defence ministry located the footage to an area just west of Bakhmut city centre and close to a children's hospital. While the analysis confirmed the attack used some kind of incendiary munitions, it could not verify the use of phosphorus.Russia has been accused of using white phosphorus in Ukraine, including duringat the beginning of the war.Moscow has never publicly admitted to using the substance, and last year Kremlin Press Secretary Dmitry Peskov insisted \"Russia has never violated international conventions\" after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said it had been used.White phosphorus is a wax-like substance that burns at 800C and ignites on contact with oxygen, creating bright plumes of smoke.Human Rights Watch (HRW) has warned the chemical is \"notorious for the severity of the injuries it causes\".It is extremely sticky and hard to remove, and can re-ignite when bandages are removed.Russia has signed thewhich bans the use of incendiary weapons - which are designed to catch fire - in civilian areas.But HRW says white phosphorus does not fall under the treaty as its primary purpose is to \"create a smokescreen to hide military operations\".The chemical has been used \"repeatedly over the past 15 years\", including by US forces against IS fighters in Iraq and Syria, according to HRW.Some analysts say its use as an incendiary weapon near civilians would still be illegal. While Bakhmut had a pre-war population of 80,000, there are practically no civilians left in the area.The attack comes a day after the commander of Russia's Wagner paramilitary group said he would pull his forces out of Bakhmut on 10 May in a row over ammunition supplies.Yevgeny Prigozhin said Wagner's casualties were \"growing in geometrical progression every day\", and blamed the defence ministry for his decision to withdraw.On Saturday, Prigozhin said Ramzan Kadyrov - the leader of Russia's semi-autonomous Chechnya region - had agreed to take over Wagner positions in the city and replace their fighters with his own.\"I am already contacting his representatives in order to start transferring positions immediately, so that at 00:00 on 10 May,\" Prigozhin's press service quoted him as saying.Despite his claims, Ukrainian officials said Wagner was redeploying mercenaries towards Bakhmut in a bid to capture the city before Tuesday's Victory Day celebrations in Russia.\"We are now seeing them pulling [fighters] from the entire offensive line where the Wagner fighters were, they are pulling [them] to the Bakhmut direction,\" Deputy Defence Minister Hanna Maliar said.The fighting comes amid reports that Ukraine is preparing a large-scale counteroffensive. Prigozhin himself has said he believes the attack could come as soon as 15 May.An offensive could take place in the Zaporizhzhia region which is about 80% controlled by Russia.On Friday, the Russian-installed governor of Zaporizhzhia ordered the evacuation of villages near the front line.Russia considers the area as its own territory, following self-styled referendums and anReported chemical attack deeply concerning - USHow will we know if Russia has used chemical weapons?Mariupol: 'We have wounded and dead inside the bunkers'"

        "link": "https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/08/investing/premarket-stocks-trading/index.html",
        "text": "When the US Federal Reserve embarked on an aggressive campaign to quash inflation last year, it did so with the goal of avoiding a painful repeat of the 1970s, when inflation spun out of control and economic malaise set in.Inflation has been sliding, indicating that after, the central bank is experiencing some success.But Gary Richardson, a Federal Reserve historian, is worried policymakers \u2014 now contemplating taking a breather \u2014 still risk repeating mistakes from that era.\u201cThe more times you pause [rate hikes], the longer the problem is going to go on,\u201d he told me. \u201cThat\u2019s a worry here.\u201dWhat\u2019s happening: When the Fed met last week, it raised its key interest rate by another quarter of a percentage point, noting that inflation remains \u201cwell above\u201d its longer-term goal of 2%.Yet amid signs of stress in the banking sector that could pile pressure on the economy, it opened the door to keeping rates unchanged when it meets again in June.\u201cThere\u2019s a sense that we\u2019re much closer to the end of this than to the beginning,\u201d Chair Jerome Powell said.Investors are cheering the notion that borrowing costs may have peaked. Richardson, however, is concerned inflation could surge again should that be the case.A premature retreat could cause the Fed to lose its handle on the situation, presenting even grimmer options down the road. That\u2019s what happened in the 1970s, he said.Quick rewind: The chair of the Federal Reserve at the time, Arthur Burns, hiked interest rates dramatically between 1972 and 1974. Then, as the economy contracted, he changed course and started cutting rates.Inflation later roared back, forcing the hand of Paul Volcker, who took over at the Fed in 1979, Richardson said. Volcker brought double-digit inflation to heel \u2014 but only by raising borrowing costs high enough to trigger back-to-back recessions in the early 1980s that at one point pushed unemployment above 10%.\u201cIf they don\u2019t stop inflation now, the historical analogy [indicates] it\u2019s not going to stop, and it\u2019s going to get worse,\u201d said Richardson, an economics professor at University of California, Irvine.There\u2019sabout whether it\u2019s an oversimplification to cast Burns as foolish and Volcker as a hero. And the US economy looks a lot different now than it.But the comparisons reveal the high stakes for the Federal Reserve at a moment of acute uncertainty.On the radar: The central bank\u2019s aim of taming inflation without causing undue strain is made harder by the fact that the economy continues to produce mixed signals.Data released Friday showed that US employersin April \u2014 a surprise increase at a time when many indicators had been pointing to a slowdown in hiring. That bolsters the case for the Fed to keep hiking, despite hopes to the contrary on Wall Street.\u201cThe strength of the April jobs data on Friday raised risks that future Fed policy will disappoint investors,\u201d Mark Haefele, chief investment officer at UBS Global Wealth Management, said in a note to clients.Senior US Treasury officials areif an agreement is not reached soon to raise the country\u2019s debt ceiling.\u201cIt\u2019s appropriate to have negotiations about the budget, about spending priorities,\u201d Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said Sunday on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week.\u201d \u201cBut we do need to raise the debt ceiling to avoid economic calamity.\u201dComing up: President Joe Biden will hold a much-anticipated meeting with Congressional leaders, including Republican House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, on Tuesday. Yellen has said that unless the debt ceiling is increased, the US won\u2019t be able to pay its bills by early June.Wally Adeyemo, the deputy Treasury secretary, said Sunday that the uncertainty is already hurting the economic outlook, making it harder for businesses to plan for the future.\u201cWe\u2019re already going to start seeing the impacts on the economy of the fact that Congress hasn\u2019t taken [a default] off the table,\u201d he said.Watch this space: There has been speculation that Biden could find a constitutional work-around if a divided Congress can\u2019t come to terms. But Yellen said there are \u201cno good options\u201d other than a deal.\u201cI don\u2019t want to consider emergency options,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat\u2019s important is the members of Congress recognize what their responsibility is.\u201dThe KBW Regional Banking Index, which tracks mid-size lenders in the United States, plunged 8% last week, its worst showing since the failure of Silicon Valley Bank in March. Yet this week is kicking off on a more optimistic note.The latest: Shares of PacWestrose 39% in premarket trading on Monday, extending a substantial rally on Friday. The California-based lender said it would slash dividend payments, allowing it to conserve cash.\u201cGiven current economic uncertainty, recent volatility in the banking sector and potential changes in regulatory capital requirements, we view reducing the dividend as a prudent step,\u201d CEO Paul Taylor said in a statement Friday. \u201cOur business remains fundamentally sound.\u201dShares of other regional banks, including Zionsand Comerica, are also up in premarket trading Monday. But given the ongoing volatility, it\u2019s too soon to say the crisis of confidence in the sector has ended.Remember: The failure of First Republic Bank last week has put investors on edge. JPMorgan Chasebought most of the bank\u2019s assets, protecting depositors, but shareholders were wiped out. That\u2019s sparked a hunt for any other lenders that may be vulnerable."

The study is part of the Center\u2019s multiyear, comprehensive, in-depth quantitative and qualitative research effort focused on the nation\u2019s Asian population,\u201d the report said.Why some have mixed feelings about the terms Asian American and AAPIThe research was conducted in the wake of a recent rise in attacks against Asian Americans, including during the Covid-19 pandemic amidand misplaced aggression about the origins of the virus.Reported hate crimes against Asians in 16 of the nation\u2019s largest cities and counties rose 164% in 2021, according to afrom the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at Cal State University San Bernardino. And afrom Pew found about a third of Asian Americans reported changing their daily routine due to concerns of racially motivated violence.The new survey is based on a sample of 7,006 adults in the US who identify as Asian, either alone or in combination with other races or Hispanic ethnicity. Respondents were interviewed between July 5, 2022, and January 27 of this year.When asked why they had hidden some aspects of their culture, Asian Americans mentioned a number of reasons from \u201cfear of being embarrassed to wanting to avoid awkward questions or having to explain themselves, and even concern of potential discrimination,\u201d the Pew report said.Their responses also varied based on their age, ethnicity and place of birth. About 30% of Asians born in the US have hidden their culture, compared with 15% of Asian immigrants, the report shows.Younger Asian adults were more likely to hide their culture. About 39% of Asians of ages 18 to 29 said they have done it, compared with 5% of Asians who are 65 and older, the report says.About 25% of Korean adults surveyed said they have hidden part of their heritage from people who are not Asian, while 20% of Indian adults, 19% of Chinese, 18% of Vietnamese, 16% of Filipino and 14% of Japanese adults said they have done the same.We speak about Asian Americans as a single block. Here's how incredibly complex they areThe survey includes several findings that highlight the diversity among Asian identity in the US.About half of respondents said they often describe themselves by ethnic labels, such as Filipino, Korean or Chinese, which reflect their family origins, the report says.Respondents indicated their friendships vary depending on where they were born. Overall, half of Asian Americans said all or most of their friends in the US are Asian but only 38% of those who were born in the US said the same."

        "text": "The nations of the world are due to meet at the COP27 summit in Egypt, to try to agree far-reaching action on climate change.They are under pressure to improve on landmark commitments they made seven years ago in Paris.The Paris Agreement saw almost all the world's nations - for the first time - support a common strategy to cut the greenhouse gas emissions which cause global warming.Adopted by 194 parties (193 countries plus the EU) in the French capital on 12 December 2015, the treaty came into force.US President Donald Trump, but his successor.Some of the key discussions in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt will be about whether and how countries are building on what they promised in Paris.When the agreement was signed, governments admitted the targets set would not be enough to limit global warming to 1.5C.At the COP26 climate summit held in Glasgow in 2021, some countries brought forward new targets. But even with these pledges, global warming would still only be limited to 2.1C, according to the independent.Parties were again asked to submit more aggressive targets for reducing emissions before COP27 to align with the Paris goal, but only 25 of the 194 have come up with improved commitments.It is expected that South Africa and Indonesia will announce funding plans to phase out fossil fuels, and it is hoped that more countries will sign up to the methane, finance and deforestation pledges drawn up at COP26.COP27 will also host one of three technical reviews as part of the \"global stocktake\" (GST). This is where countries review whether their plans are strong enough to prevent temperatures rising above 1.5C, using analysis prepared by UN officials and scientists.It is hoped the process will strengthen the case for further action.The Paris Agreement restated a commitment made in 2009 that the world's richer countries should provide $100bn (\u00a387bn) annually by 2020 to help developing nations deal with the effects of climate change, and build greener economies.But in 2019 only $79.6bn was raised. A recent UN report- even though a new and more ambitious target is supposed to be set for 2025.For many countries, this is the biggest issue to resolve at COP26 - and the very poorest are urging action.Developing countries are also demanding that \"loss and damage finance\" be included as an agenda item. This is specific compensation to cover losses they are already incurring from the effects of climate change.But developed nations fear any agreement would suggest they accept liability for global warming and would be tied into decades of repayments.Although the Paris Agreement laid out a clear target point, it did not contain the specific detail on how to reach it.The ambition is to create a \"net zero\" world by 2050. That means reducing greenhouse gas emissions as much as possible, and removing any remaining emissions from the atmosphere, through natural or artificial processes.Scientists argue it is vital to assess the progress being made towards that goal every year.The UN group of climate experts, the IPCC, has estimated an annual budget of carbon emissions the world can release before temperatures rise above 1.5 degrees, measured in gigatonnes of CO2 equivalent (GtCO2e).In 2018,that the world should only release 25-30 GtCO2e per year by 2030.It currently emits 36.3 GtCO2e per year,.The priority of COP27 will be to develop a specific plan of action to bring that figure down, and - as in Paris - secure international support for the way forward."

As a result the government.Currently, less than 40% of the UK's required emissions reductions are supported by proven policies and sufficient funding, according to the.So, what progress is the government making?The government says.The government is expecting a 40-60% rise in demand for electricity by 2035, for example due to the electrification of transport. This means taking the carbon emissions out of electricity generation is important.UK governments have been relatively successful in cutting emissions from electricity generation. These.This is largely due to a substantial reduction in electricity generated from coal - the dirtiest fossil fuel - from 40% in 2012 to less than 2% last year.The proportion of electricity generated by renewables has grown to around 40% in the last few years, up from just over 10% a decade ago. Fossil fuels - mainly natural gas - still generate about 40% of UK electricity. The remainder comes from nuclear power and imports.The government has set ambitious targets to accelerate the expansion of low carbon energy to reduce reliance on natural gas. These includeby 2030 and.Aby the National Audit Office warned that the lack of a clear delivery plan risked the UK not meeting its 2035 carbon-free electricity target.

There were 110 leaders present, but just 7 were women.This is one of the lowest concentrations of women seen at these UN climate summits - known as COPs,, which tracks female participation at such events.The male skew among leaders reflected a broader trend across the delegation teams that countries have sent. Analysis by the BBC of the participant list found that less than 34% of country negotiation staff were female. Some teams were more than 90% male.These delegation teams participate in negotiations at the conference on key climate issues such as funding and limiting use of fossil fuels.In 2011 countries pledged to increase female participation at these talks, but the share this year has fallen since a peak of 40% in 2018,Dr Jeanne d'Arc Mujawamariya, environment minister for Rwanda - which has 52% women in its cabinet - told the BBC the outcomes of the negotiations will be affected by the lack of women participating.This was a sentiment echoed by Rep. Kathy Castor, chair of the US Select Committee on the Climate Crisis. She told the BBC at COP27 that women's presence was vital.\"It is absolutely fundamental to climate action that we educate young women and girls, but that means they must have a seat at the table at international conferences,\" she said.On Monday,by charity ActionAid revealed that women and girls are facing increased and specific risks as the climate crisis worsens.The report reveals that in many developing nations - which are facing the worst impacts of climate change - women have greater responsibility for securing water, food and fuel for their families, which can be more difficult during floods, drought or other climate-related crises.The majority of agricultural workers are also women, so when there is severe drought, as seen currently in East Africa, their income can be drastically cut. The UN has estimated thatare women.Dr Sila Monthe is an International Rescue Committee health manager currently working in Kakuma Refugee Camp in Kenya. She told the BBC that she has seen increased nutrient deficiencies in women and young girls in the drought-affected area \"as they often eat last, and worst\".There are also concerns that as women go further afield to collect food and water they are exposed to increased risks of violence.Sophie Rigg, senior climate advisor at ActionAid, told the BBC that climate change is exacerbating gender inequalities and the solutions being discussed at COP27 must be tailored to the specific issues being faced by women.And young women are currently leading the charge on taking climate action,Some of the most famous legal cases brought against governments for inaction on climate change, have been brought by women.Global director for gender at the World Bank, Hana Brixi, said there is increasing evidence that having women participating improves the outcomes in global negotiations like COP27.Ms Rigg from ActionAid UK agrees: \"There is no getting around when women are in the room they create solutions that are proven to be more sustainable.\"Because of this Ms Brixi said that she is seeing progress in female participation as organisations and governments wake up to the impact they can have.BBC analysis of the country teams at COP27 in Egypt shows that European, North American and island states are more likely to have balanced teams, whilst African and Middle Eastern countries are more likely to skew male.Ms Castor, from the US delegation, said that her country's negotiators have raised the issue of female participation with this years' hosts in Egypt and will be doing so with other countries."

It's the first time young people have had a dedicated space like this, where last week activists held a formal meeting with UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres.It's one of the most buzzing areas of COP27, with activists jostling to find space to sit and chat on the floor, and Ayisha tells me she's proud of the space.\"This is for the youth, organized by us. Unlike government and business areas, there's no corporate branding everywhere,\" she says.She says questions about Greta miss the point about the reality of climate change. This summer, devastating floods killed 1,700 people in her home country Pakistan. \"The world has come to an end for people\u2026 For me, the stakes are so high that I can't just give up hope for change,\" she says.Kenyan Mana Omar, 27, worries the summit will not deliver the climate finance that her country needs - calling COP27 more like a \"trade fair\".But she still travelled here to represent her nomadic community severely affected by drought. \"My community are missing here, their voices are totally unheard, they live in areas with no internet. I just hope I can do my best to bring their message here,\" she explains.She says her role is to have \"hope where there is none\" and she wants a better future for her one-year-old daughter.But many activists, particularly from developing nations, say they faced significant barriers in coming to the summit in Egypt.Imran Hussein, from Bangladesh, lost his father in cyclone Aila in 2009 and says he is extremely worried about sea level rise in his costal home. He is at COP to get \"climate justice\" for his mother, who has worked in a garment factory since Imran's father died.Imran and his colleague Sohanur Rahmen explain they got grants for travel and hotels, but they cannot afford to eat at the conference.Delegates faced costs of about $4,000 a week for accommodation, as well as the costs of travel and visas.Activists say future climate summits must include special funds and accommodation for young people from civil society.But, waving their passes, Imran and Sohanur are proud they have been given spaces on Bangladesh's negotiating team.It gives them access to conversations behind-the-scenes where countries stake out their positions on the final agreements.Negotiations between countries on how to curb climate change will go on for the rest of the week, with reports suggesting a large gap remains between rich and poor nations.Youth activists are hopeful they will secure more money for communities devastated by climate change, and a firm commitment from leaders to radically phase out fossil fuels. But most admit they will probably have to come back next year.The COP27 global climate summit in Egypt is seen as crucial if climate change is to be brought under control. More than 200 countries are attending the summit to discuss further measures to cut emissions and prepare for climate change, and it could lead to major changes to our everyday lives.Net zero sceptics set to meet MP reviewing targetWhere does Rishi Sunak stand on climate change?Why COP27 matters"

He is a publicity seeker who has not followed through on previous threats.Russian troops and fighters from Wagner, a private military company, have been trying to capture Bakhmut for months - despite its questionable strategic value.Western officials believe thousands of Russian and Wagner troops have been killed in the fighting, and the eastern Ukrainian city has become a symbolic prize.Yet - although Russian troops and Wagner fighters are on the same side - it is an uneasy alliance.Prigozhin has regularly criticised Russian officials for what he claims is a lack of front-line support.In his new statement, Prigozhin claimed that Gen Sergei Surovikin - who commanded Russia's forces in Ukraine between October- had been appointed to liaise between Russia's regular military and Wagner mercenaries.\"This is the only man with the star of an army general who knows how to fight,\" Prigozhin said. \"No other army general is reasonable.\"While Prigozhin didn't expressly reverse his pledge to withdraw troops from Bakhmut, he said his forces had been given permission to \"act in Bakhmut as we see fit\" - appearing to suggest they will remain.The Kremlin has not commented on Prigozhin's latest statement.Wagner has its own set of commanders, objectives and motivations, and Prigozhin is widely believed to hold his own domestic political ambitions.Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu and Chief of the General Staff Valery Gerasimov have often been the focus for his anger, amid reports of infighting among different power groups in Vladimir Putin's entourage.In\"Shoigu! Gerasimov! Where is the... ammunition?... They came here as volunteers and die for you to fatten yourselves in your mahogany offices.\"And he said Wagner's casualties were \"growing in geometrical progression every day\" because of the lack of ammunition.At the time, Ukrainian officials expressed scepticism that Prigozhin truly intended to withdraw his forces from Bakhmut.Deputy Defence Minister Hanna Maliar said on Friday that Wagner was actually redeploying mercenaries towards Bakhmut in a bid to capture the city before Tuesday's Victory Day celebrations in Russia.In other developments in Ukraine and Russia:From Putin's chef to head of Russia's private armyWhat is Russia's Wagner Group of mercenaries?Russia troop deaths hit 20,000 in five months - US"

We're constantly bombarded with news articles and social media about how it's just crisis after crisis - ice caps melting, disasters - it can be very overwhelming,\" explains Roisin, 16, from County Antrim in Northern Ireland.Roisin is on the youth advisory board of Save The Children, which recently found thatthey are inheriting.But she says there is hope too: \"You can always see young activists like Greta Thunberg, and people like David Attenborough taking action on it.\"Roisin says she has become a vegetarian and makes sure she only shops locally. \"Taking action is my only way of dealing with climate anxiety - it means I know I've done everything I can do to solve the problem,\" she says.Some campaigners, like 23-year-old Zahra Biabani in California, say the widespread focus on climate catastrophe can be misleading.When she began posting online about environmental issues at university, she realised there was \"a gap between education and action, which was being filled by 'doomism'\".\"Climate education can be debilitating without a form of encouragement to act, especially when we see what's going on the world, and how it's going to get worse,\" she explains.Allow Instagram content?This article contains content provided by Instagram.

Climate change is a shift in those average conditions.The rapid climate change we are now seeing is caused by humans using oil, gas and coal for their homes, factories and transport.When these fossil fuels burn, they release greenhouse gases - mostly carbon dioxide (CO2). These gases trap the Sun's heat and cause the planet's temperature to rise.The world is now about 1.1C warmer than it was in the 19th Century - and.Temperature rises must slow down if we want to avoid the worst consequences of climate change, according to climate scientists. They say global warming needs to be.However, unless further action is taken,by then. A 2021 report by the independent Climate Action Tracker group calculated that the world was heading forIf nothing is done,in the future, leading to devastating heatwaves, millions losing their homes to rising sea levels, and the irreversible loss of plant and animal species.Extreme weather eventsacross the globe, threatening lives and livelihoods.With further warming, some regions could become uninhabitable, as. East Africa just saw its fifth season of failed rains, which thehas put up to 22 million people at risk of severe hunger.Extreme temperatures can also increase the risk of wildfires - as seen in Europe last summer.about seven times more land burnt between January and the middle of July 2022, compared with the average.Hotter temperatures also mean that previously frozen ground will melt in places like Siberia, releasing greenhouse gases trapped for centuries into the atmosphere, further worsening climate change.In other regions, extreme rainfall caused historic flooding last year - as seen in China, Pakistan and Nigeria.People living in developing countries are expected to suffer the most as they have fewer resources to adapt to climate change. But there isthe least greenhouse gas emissions.The planet's oceans and its habitats are also under threat., funded by the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, suggests that between 10% and 15% of marine species are already at risk of extinction.In a warmer world, land animals will also find it harder to find the food and water they need to live. For example, polar bears could die out as the ice they rely on melts away, and elephants will struggle to find the 150-300 litres of water a day they need.Scientists believeif action is not taken.Climate change will have different effects across the world., if global temperature rise cannot be kept within 1.5C:Countries agree climate change can only be tackled by working together, and in, they pledged to try to keep global warming to 1.5C.In November 2022, Egypt hosted a summit for world leaders, called COP27, where countries came together to make new commitments to tackling climate change.Many countries have pledged to get to \"net zero\" by 2050. This means reducing greenhouse gas emissions as much as possible, and balancing out remaining emissions by absorbing an equivalent amount from the atmosphere.Experts agree that, but requires governments, businesses and individuals to make substantial changes now.Major changes need to come from governments and businesses, but scientists say some small changes in our lives:"

        "text": "Some of the UK's biggest pension funds have voted against reappointing BP's chairman over a decision to weaken its climate plans, but the majority of shareholders backed Helge Lund.It comes after the energy giant cut back its target to reduce emissions by the end of the decade.As well as the dissenting votes there were also disruptions during the annual meeting from climate protestors.BP said it valued \"constructive challenge and engagement\".The original target to reduce emissions was agreed by shareholders in 2022 and included a promise to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 35% to 40% by the end of this decade.But in February, BP announced it was now aiming for a 20% to 30% cut so it could produce more oil and gas and extend the life of existing fossil fuel projects.BP chief executive Bernard Looney said this was in response to increased concerns about energy security following the invasion of Ukraine.The five pension funds told the BBC that their vote against the company's chairman, Helge Lund, was a protest against the company's actions.The pension funds have \u00a3440m invested in BP, which represents less than 1% of the company's total shares. But they manage the pensions of more than a third of the UK's workers so are an influential voice.Mr Lund received a majority of more than 90% for re-election during the annual meeting on Thursday.Katharina Lindmeier, senior responsible investment manager at Nest, the government-backed pension fund, told the BBC: \"Not only were we disappointed to see the company going back on the targets, but we were also really surprised not to have had any consultation.\"The five pension funds - Nest, the Universities Pension Scheme, LGPS Central, Brunel Pension Partnership and Border to Coast -  are concerned that the new targets put BP financially at risk because the company's fossil fuel projects are likely to lose value as the world moves towards net zero emissions.Nest also told the BBC that there were concerns over BP's actions on reducing gas flaring, after seeing the BBC documentaryThe BBC News investigation showed that BP was one of several major oil companiesat oil fields in Iraq, which produces cancer-linked pollutants.Ali Hussein Julood, who documented his life in Rumaila, Iraq for the documentary, suspected his childhood leukaemia was due to the flaring. He passed away on 21 April after his cancer returned.Ali's father told the board of his son's passing during the AGM, and how despite their efforts, there was still black smoke and gas flaring outside his front door.Mr Looney gave his condolences at the meeting to Ali's family and said: \"We are continuing to reduce flaring at Rumaila. We are making progress and it must continue to be made\".The pension funds told the BBC they only found out about the change in BP's climate targets via media reports.They then approached BP to ask for a vote on the new targets but BP refused, arguing it was not a material change to the strategy.Patrick O'Hara, director of responsible investment at LGPS Central, told the BBC: \"If you change the strategy you should really enter into a dialogue with those that supported you.\"He said he thought BP's decision was driven by short-term profit considerations rather than the long term sustainability of the company.\"Are these strategies science-based if you can flex them based on what the oil and gas price is? We are long-term investors and we expect the company to take a long-term view\", he said.The company's profits more than doubled to $27.7bn (\u00a323bn) in 2022, as energy prices soared after Russia invaded Ukraine.As well as protest voting, there were half a dozen green activists removed from BP's annual meeting of its board and shareholders on Thursday, as they demanded the company \"stop drilling\" for fossil fuels.The Dutch environmental organisation Follow This also put forward a resolution - supported by the five pension funds - which calls for more aggressive targets on what are known as scope 3 emissions - emissions from the use of its products.BP recommended that shareholders not support this resolution calling it \"unclear\", \"simplistic\" and \"disruptive\".ISS and Glass Lewis are the world's largest investor services and recommended to BP shareholders they advise to oppose the climate resolution.Courteney Keatinge, senior director for ESG research at Glass Lewis, said the company does not see BP's actions to reduce its climate targets as a financial risk because the world will continue to use oil and gas past 2050.\"We are not operating under a net zero 2050 scenario, the demand is going to be there [in 2050], people will be flying planes and heating their homes\", she said.The resolution only garnered 16.75% of the vote but that was up on 14.9% the same resolution received last year.Under Poisoned SkiesThe deadly impact of the oil giants' toxic air pollution on children and the planet is revealed in this BBC News Arabic investigation from the front line of climate change in Iraq.The documentary is availableand.BP scales back climate targets as profits hit recordUndercover in the world\u2019s dirtiest oil field"

        "text": "A new global climate pact - the Sharm el-Sheikh Implementation Plan - was agreed at the COP27 summit.It included a historic commitment by richer nations to give money to developing nations to help them recover from the damage and economic losses wreaked from ongoing climate change impacts.This comes after a year of devastating climate change-related disasters, from severe floods in Pakistan to ongoing drought in East Africa.But there was also disappointment expressed by some world leaders that there was no agreement to reduce fossil fuel usage.The plan - although not legally binding - has provided new ambitions for the world's nations on climate change.New moneyFor the first time countries agreed to establish a \"loss and damage\" fund.This will be a pot of money to help poorer nations recover from the impacts of climate change, such as destroyed homes, flooded land or lost income from dried-out crops.Previously, these countries have only received money for mitigation - efforts to move away from fossil fuels, and adaptation. This is money to prepare for the future impacts of climate change.The issue of loss and damage has been highly controversial. Richer nations have previously not wanted to agree to a new fund as they thought it would make them liable to cover all economic losses from climate change.How much countries will get from the fund - and by when - is still to be decided.Fossil fuelsAt last year's summit, COP26, in Glasgow, countries agreed to \"phase down\" coal. At one point during this year's negotiations countries were discussing expanding that to include oil and gas.But.Instead countries committed to \"enhancing a clean energy mix, including low-emission and renewable energy\".But the phrase \"low-emission energy\" has raised concerns.It has not been formally defined, and there is worry that it could open the door to more gas development - as burning gas produces less emissions than other fossil fuels like coal.The UK's independent climate change body,there had been \"limited progress on ambition to reduce emissions\".And the UK's Alok Sharma, who was COP President in Glasgow, said he was \"pretty disappointed we haven't moved much further than what we got in Glasgow\".A flurry of other announcements was made.Nature and foodFor the first time the main agreement had specific sections on forests and \"nature-based solutions\".These are actions that protect or enhance the environment that also have climate benefits, for example restoring mangroves.By including these new sections, leaders agreed that climate change, and efforts to protect plants and animals, should be complementary and not contradictory.Just weeks after COP27 governments met again in Montreal to agree a \"global goal for nature\".The text also mentioned food for the first time, and recognised how food shortages could continue to be driven by climate change.from the universities of Bournemouth, Exeter and Sheffield, published in October, estimated that 42% of recent food price inflation has been due to climate change.In Egypt countries committed to a four-year programme to discuss solutions to ongoing food issues.Buying less stuffCurrently countries calculate their total emissions and set targets, based on what they produce within their borders such as from producing electricity, or burning fuels.This means they don't count the emissions from the goods and services produced by another country for them. This is despite the fact that developed nations import large amounts of manufactured products.If these \"consumption-based\" emissions were counted then the UK's carbon footprintFor the first time in a global climate agreement countries recognised \"the importance of transition[ing] to sustainable patterns of consumption\".It is not yet clear how governments will translate this into local plans or actions.Trading carbonIn 2021 in Glasgow countries agreed to establish a global market for trading carbon.Simply put, this means that countries or companies that produce fewer emissions than their targets could \"sell\" the carbon as a credit to another country or company that has produced too many emissions.Although the basic rules for this market had been agreed before Egypt there were still a lot of unresolved issues.The main one was what could be counted as a carbon credit. For example if a country planted lots of trees which absorb carbon dioxide could they sell this?A smaller group of countries has been working on the issue for the past year and presented their recommendations in Sharm el-Sheikh.But many observers and government's weren't happy.Teresa Anderson, Climate Justice Lead at Action Aid International, told the BBC there was concern that indigenous groups' rights wouldn't be protected: \"You can make a really tenuous claim about your product - that it will remove carbon in some way from the atmosphere, but that could be in the form of tree plantations taking land from communities.\"She added that \"one of the looniest proposals on the table is that you can actually cut down forests to turn into furniture\" - with companies claiming they store carbon.A decision on this issue has now been delayed till COP28 at the end of 2023.Whilst last year's COP in Glasgow was all about target setting, COP27 in Egypt was all about implementation.Six years ago, countries were asked to make changes to keep global warming \"well below\" 2C - and to try to aim for 1.5C.Ahead of the conference 200 countries were asked to submit new plans to cut emissions by 2030, to prevent temperatures rising by more than 1.5C.With these new plans, global temperatures are still expected to rise to 2.4C. So the Egyptian COP President Sameh Shoukry wanted to focus on turning some of the more ambitious targets and pledges into tangible action.Some countries will put the commitments they make at COP into domestic law, but most will have to be self-policed.This means it is difficult to hold countries to account for their promises.Back in 2009 richer nations promised developing countries they would give them $100bn (\u00a388bn) a year by 2020 to help with climate change, that goal was missed and there has been no action.Next year's COP28 summit is in UAE."

        "text": "This video can not be playedWatch the bollard being run over, bent, burned and then stolenYou have probably never felt sympathy for a bollard before, but spare a thought for the one installed on Howard Street in east Oxford last year.It is probably the most abused bollard in the UK.It is blocking the road as part of a Low Traffic Neighbourhood - an LTN - and has been repeatedly run over, beaten, bent, burnt and, finally, stolen.LTN schemes sound innocuous - they attempt to restrict through-traffic in local communities to cut congestion and pollution - but they have provoked fury.As well as bollard abuse, LTNs have sometimes led to confrontations between local residents and - more recently - to mass protests.Over the past few months, councils across England have been lobbied by vocal campaigners against the introduction of new traffic schemes, and some council meetings have been disrupted by activists.LTNs involve restricting roads in local communities to virtually all through-traffic.They are funded by the government as part of its \u00a33.2bn active travel policy - and the aim is that half of all trips in England's towns and cities be walked, cycled, or made in a wheelchair by 2030.It is part of a push to reduce air pollution, cut greenhouse gas emissions and make us all a bit fitter and healthier.Local authorities bid for government cash to pay for things, such as cycle lanes, big plant pots and bollards to redirect traffic to other roads.Oxford has been a focus of the debate over LTNs in recent years.It got its first permanent LTN in the east of the city two years ago - and a second one is now being trialled.There are also tough restrictions on how traffic moves through the centre of the city - including number plate recognition cameras that issue fines to cars driving on the high street during restricted hours.Oxfordshire County Council says the medieval city can't cope with the level of traffic it has now.But opponents say the city's efforts have ended up slowing traffic on main roads and dividing communities.\"They are setting neighbour against neighbour,\" warns Richard Parnham, an Oxford resident who is campaigning against traffic restrictions in the city with a local pressure group called Reconnecting Oxford.Mr Parnham says the schemes have \"torn the city apart\".There is no shortage of videos online showing angry confrontations over the new traffic schemes.When bollards are stolen some residents have stepped in to block the road themselves, sometimes provoking violent reactions.Theo Hopkins is 79 years old and one of these \"human bollards\".He says he has been hit twice during confrontations with angry drivers. Once a car pushed him off the road.Prof Rachel Aldred of Westminster University has studied the impact of 46 schemes in London and says motor traffic is down by an average of about 30% on the roads within the boundaries of the LTNs.But many drivers and residents complain that LTNs just push the problem from side roads to main roads.Prof Aldred says the evidence here isn't clear.Recorded traffic goes up on the boundary roads in half the LTNs she has studied - and down in the other half. The average increase in traffic flows on boundary roads is just over 1%. Prof Aldred says if LTNs were systematically pushing traffic on to boundary roads she believes her study would have picked that up.Most LTNs are introduced on a temporary basis subject to consultation with local people, typically after a period of more than a year.But, in the face of negative feedback, many local authorities have ripped out LTNs - some before the end of the consultation period.Ealing Council in London removed seven of nine LTNs it had introduced, for example. A key issue for residents who opposed the schemes appeared to be the almost \u00a33m of fines the council had collected from drivers who used the LTNs as cut throughs.The Taxpayers' Alliance, a pressure group which campaigns for lower taxes, says there has been a massive increase in fines imposed on motorists by local authorities.It made Freedom of Information requests to 41 councils in England and Scotland - 37 responded.It found the value of fines issued inside LTNs had increased from \u00a3700,000 in the year 2019-20, to almost \u00a370m in 2021-22.\"We're not against schemes to improve the air quality in our cities,\" says Elliot Keck of the Alliance. \"What we are against is schemes being used as cash cows.\"The Local Government Association, a cross-party body representing local authorities in England and Wales, says the cash raised covers the cost of enforcement with any surplus \"being spent on local transport improvements\".But the opposition to the introduction of traffic restrictions has been becoming increasingly vocal.Thousands of protesters marched in Oxford in February after the council announced plans for new restrictions on traffic through the centre of the city.There was a flurry of claims on social media that the restrictions are evidence of a sinister global plot to limit our freedom to travel.Since then, there have been protests in Cambridge, Bath and Thetford - while in Colchester, a council meeting to discuss proposals for more sustainable transport was disrupted by noisy protestors.Justin Rowlatt travels to Oxford for Panorama, to see how the introduction of Low Traffic Neighbourhoods (LTNs) has led to vandalism and angry confrontations.Watch- also on BBC One at 20:00 on Monday 17 April (20:30 in Wales)The actor-turned-activist Laurence Fox, who in recent years became known for his opposition to the Covid lockdowns, attended the protest in Oxford.He told the BBC he was worried about what he called \"a government desire to control our movement, speech, everything\".\"We should be seeking more freedom, not less,\" says Mr Fox.Zuhura Plummer, an Oxford resident who has campaigned in favour of the city's LTNs as part of a group called Oxfordshire Liveable Streets, sees things very differently.\"What about the freedom to be able to cycle down the street without getting knocked off your bike? What about the freedom of asthmatics to have better air quality?\" she asks.\"We've given up a lot of different freedoms for the one freedom to drive your car wherever you want at any time.\"FollowThousands join protest against traffic schemes"

        "text": "Spain recorded its hottest ever temperature for April on Thursday, hitting 38.8C according to the country's meteorological service.The record figure was reached in Cordoba airport in southern Spain just after 15:00 local time (14:00 BST).For days a blistering heatwave has hit the country with temperatures 10-15C warmer than expected for April.It's been driven by a mass of very hot air from Africa, coupled with a slow moving weather system.\"This is not normal. Temperatures are completely out of control this year,\" Cayetano Torres, a spokesman for Spain's meteorological office, told BBC News.Experts were surprised by the scale of the heat experienced across southern Spain in recent days.\"This heat event in Spain is absolutely extreme, unprecedented with temperatures never seen before in April. In some locations records are being beaten by a 5C margin, which is something that has happened only a handful of times at weather stations around the world,\" said Maximiliano Herrera, a climatologist who runs antwitter account.This video can not be playedWatch: Why is it so hot in Spain this week?Schools will be allowed to adapt their timetables to avoid the worst of the heat. The Madrid underground has trains passing more frequently than usual in order to prevent long waits on the platform, and public swimming pools are expected to open a month earlier than normal.Cristina Linares, a scientist at the Carlos III Health Institute, warned in particular of the impact on the poor.\"Poverty is the key factor when it comes to explaining why there are more deaths associated with extreme temperatures. Income is the factor with the closest link to the impact of heat on day-to-day deaths.\"Heatwaves are also striking many locations globally as climate change exacerbates naturally high temperatures.While parts of Britain are cooler than average right now, the opposite is the case in many regions of Spain.Meteorologists say that a combination of factors is responsible for the exceptional temperatures being seen there this week.Hot weather across North Africa is pushing heat into Europe. A high pressure weather system plus clear skies over the Iberian peninsula are allowing more sunshine to hit the ground, which is already so dry it can't evaporate the heat.The high temperatures come on top of long running drought in many parts of Spain. Reservoirs in the Guadalquivir basin are only at 25% of capacity.This combination is raising the prospect of early forest fires, with the national weather service warning that large swathes of the country would be at risk.  Spain saw the most land burned of any country in Europe in 2022.Climate change is very likely playing a role in this heatwave, according to experts in the field.\"We know that 2022 was the second warmest year on record for Europe, and it was the warmest summer on record,\" Dr Samantha Burgess from the Copernicus climate change service told BBC News.\"Europe is warming at twice the global rate and we know because there is a higher rate of warming, there's a higher probability of extreme events. And those extreme events include heat waves.\"As well as the impact on young and old, another concern is agriculture.Many farmers are experiencing difficulties due to the ongoing lack of rain, with the government in Madrid asking the European Union for financial help.Some landowners say they won't plant crops due to the dry conditions, which could have implications for food supplies across Europe.This heatwave in Spain is not an isolated event - all across the world high temperatures in the first few months of this year have shattered records.Eight countries in central and eastern Europe set new all time highs for the warmest January weather on the very first day of this year.Countries across Asia have seen extreme heat in recent weeks. In northwest Thailand, the temperature hit 45.4C on 15 April, while in Laos it reached 42.7C.In Bangladesh, the capital Dhaka saw the mercury rise above 40C, believed to be the hottest day in 58 years.Another factor likely to influence weather across the world over the coming months is the likely onset of an El Ni\u00f1o event.This will see more heat emerge in the Pacific ocean off the coast of Peru.  If it happens, then 2024 might emerge as the world's warmest year on record, with more storms, fires and floods.\"It seems we are living in a world of a new normal here,\" said Dr Fahad Saeed, from research organisation, Climate Analytics.\"These people in regions like Asia are the people who have been adapting to these kinds of extreme temperatures for thousands of years, but its is now getting beyond their ability to adapt.\"\"That's why we are witnessing rising death rates due to heat each year in this part of the world.\""

        "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/world-australia-62489056",
        "text": "In 2008, the Brown family watched on helplessly as destructive bushfires ripped through the Victorian countryside. For them, it was a wakeup call.It was the third time in several years flames had come close to torching vineyards that five generations of their family had poured over a century of love and work into.Warming days, declining rainfall and subsequent drought had snuck up on them, but this was a glaring warning sign they couldn't ignore.Climate change had become the family businesses' \"biggest threat\", Caroline Brown says.It's not a problem unique to the Browns - the family behind one of the oldest wine brands in Australia. The country is the world's fifth-largest wine exporter and is home to a diverse array of wine regions most other countries could only dream of.And while climate change is threatening winemakers worldwide, Australia's industry is on the front lines.Ashley Ratcliff's vineyards are already in one of the hottest and driest wine regions on the planet.There was one year, he recalls, when their vineyards in South Australia's Riverland region got only 90mm of rain - 10 times less than the annual average for the famous French wine region of Bordeaux.\"It was hot, everything was dirty and dusty,\" he says. \"And then on the other extreme, you get the really wet years where you never think it's going to dry out.\"And it will only get worse.In the next 20 years, the Riverland will be about 1.3 degrees hotter and rainfall will drop, according to modelling by Australian researchers.With that will also come more extreme weather events, which are already a near constant in Australia.The country is still recovering from years of record-breaking floods, but with an El Nino summer likely to bring dry and hot conditions to much of Australia, panic is growing ahead of the coming fire season.While grapevines are described as \"one of the most valuable weeds in the world\", capable of growing almost anywhere, the fruit itself is vulnerable to its environment.And climate change is already messing with flavour and quality. Heat affects the speed at which the grapes ripen and with it, their sugar and acidity levels.Already the growing season has shifted forward - by weeks in some places - which also impacts logistics and infrastructure.Then there's the impact of weather events driven by climate change, which at their worst can wipe out an entire season's crop.All of this means growing certain types of wine grapes in Australia - those suited to cooler climates like Sauvignon Blanc, Chardonnay and Pinot Noir - will only get harder.The Ratcliffs strategically decided to plant \"alternative\" varieties more suited to warmer climes when they purchased their vineyards in 2003.They deemed the risk posed by climate change as greater than that of selling lesser-known grapes. Two decades on, anyone not contemplating doing the same is kidding themselves, Mr Ratcliff says.\"There are all those fervent doomsday people. [But] I think there is an opportunity to rebrand and make the industry really exciting - to use climate change as a positive rather than a negative.\"The average consumer won't notice a big difference between the wines they love and the up-and-coming alternative varieties that Ricca Terra sells - like Montepulciano, Fiano and Nero D'Avola. The grapes are hardier and often more planet-friendly too, requiring less water.The Brown family too is growing alternative varieties, including some they created with Australia's science agency. But they have also looked south to keep current favourites alive.With climate change in mind, they began snapping up vineyards in cooler locations like Tasmania - a growing trend across the industry.\"We realised that having all of our vineyards in one location in Victoria meant we had all our eggs in one basket,\" Ms Brown says.But Tahbilk Winery's Hayley Purbrick is one grower who is staying put, despite \"confronting\" climate modelling.\"We have a philosophy that our responsibility is to create a climate where grapes can grow,\" she says. \"There's so much you can do at a local level and sometimes when we think [about climate change on a global scale] we get a bit too wrapped up in the impossibility of what we can't do.\"Her family's vineyards in the Goulburn Valley incorporate as much shade and as many \"natural coolants\" as possible. They're planted on the edge of wetlands and are surrounded by 160 hectares of trees.They've also slashed their carbon emissions to net zero, through things like solar power, using heat reflective paint to limit the need for air conditioning, and reducing waste.It's working so far: \"We're lucky in the sense that we're three degrees cooler than places even three kilometres away.\"But researcher Tom Remenyi says adaptation and mitigation can only take growers so far.On the current trajectory, the whole of Australia is going to get warmer and dryer - and while a couple of degrees might not sound like a lot, it could be catastrophic, he says.\"A three-degree shift of the average increases the frequency of extremely hot days by about tenfold, if not more. If the whole globe warms more than three degrees, it's highly likely that we will not be worried about growing wine.\"And that's exactly what is weighing on growers like Caroline Brown. For her, the family business is inextricably entwined with the family history.She spent her childhood getting into mischief with her cousins among the vineyards at Milawa. Now they all work in the business.She desperately wants the same for the next generations.\"We're very passionate about family,\" she says. \"Our great-grandfather started the business\u2026 we'd love one day for our great-grandchildren to be in the lucky positions we're in.\"But she is well aware that climate change threatens that.\"If we don't look after where we're growing grapes then we're not going to have any way to plant them in the future. So it is scary,\" she says.But there will be very few - if any - of the country's favourite varieties it won't be able to grow somewhere, she argues.\"You'll always be able to grow Cabernet in Australia, but it just might not taste as good in the years to come.\"Brits snap up Australian wine not going to China"

        "text": "Climate change could dramatically reduce life in the deepest parts of our oceans that are reached by sunlight, scientists warn.Global warming could curtail life in the so-called twilight zone by as much as 40% by the end of the century, according to new research.The twilight zone lies between 200m (656ft) and 1,000m (3,281ft).It teems with life but was home to fewer organisms during warmer periods of Earth's history, researchers found.In research led by the University of Exeter, scientists looked at two warm periods in Earth's past, about 50 million years ago and 15 million years ago, examining records from preserved microscopic shells.They found far fewer organisms lived in the zone during these periods, because bacteria degraded food more quickly, meaning less of it reached the twilight zone from the surface.\"The rich variety of twilight zone life evolved in the last few million years, when ocean waters had cooled enough to act rather like a fridge, preserving the food for longer, and improving conditions allowing life to thrive,\" said Dr Katherine Crichton, from the University of Exeter, who was the lead author of the study.The twilight zone, also known as the disphotic zone, is a vital habitat for marine life. It is too dim for photosynthesis to occur but home to more fish than the rest of the ocean put together, as well as a wide range of life including microbes, plankton and jellies.It also serves a key environmental function as a carbon sink - drawing planet-heating gas out of our atmosphere.The scientists simulated what might be happening in the twilight zone now, and what could happen in future due to climate warming. They said their findings suggested that significant changes may already be underway.\"Our study is a first step to finding out how vulnerable this ocean habitat may be to climate warming,\" said Dr Crichton.\"Unless we rapidly reduce greenhouse gas emissions, this could lead to the disappearance or extinction of much twilight zone life within 150 years, with effects spanning millennia thereafter.\"The paper was published in the journal Nature Communications."

        "link": "https://edition.cnn.com/2022/06/21/sport/british-gymnastics-abuse-intl-spt-cmd/index.html",
        "text": "For Claire Heafford, the abuse she says she suffered as a young gymnast has left a lasting mark on her life.Heafford, who\u2019s now in her 40s, toldshe experienced symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) after competing in British gymnastics in the 1990s, when she alleges, she was physically and emotionally abused.Now, she says she finally feels \u201cvindicated,\u201d after years fighting for reform in the sport through the organization she co-founded,.Last week, anconcluded that British Gymnastics allowed for a culture of physical and emotional abuse and failed to provide a safe environment for gymnasts, with children body-shamed, belittled and abused.Heafford said she felt \u201ca massive feeling of vindication\u201d following the release of a review conducted by barrister Anne Whyte, saying it \u201ccompletely validated everything that we\u2019d anecdotally known and had been reporting and campaigning on for two years.\u201dReleased Thursday, Whyte\u2019s 300-plus page review concluded that British Gymnastics should have been aware of the \u201cbullying, harassment and excessive control\u201d that occurred in training clubs between 2008 and 2020.\u201cMy own experience was that I was trained by the first Russian that was brought over to the UK in the 90s,\u201d Heafford told CNN\u2019s.\u201cI grew up in a Soviet training camp in the heart of the home counties [the counties surrounding London]. It was too bizarre to be believed. So as a kid just at an ordinary state school, trying to explain to my school friends, what my training life was like was difficult,\u201d she said.In the report, Whyte highlighted the \u201crecruitment of a significant number of coaches\u201d from the former Soviet Union and the Soviet bloc.\u201cThe technical skill and experience of these coaches, whilst formidable, was sometimes accompanied by an attitude to the gymnast which was autocratic and dismissive and left athletes feeling like commodities,\u201d Whyte wrote, adding that the ability of these coaches to produce decorated gymnasts was admired and later emulated by coaches in the UK.Heafford says what she experienced in the 1990s mirrors incidents reported to Whyte, who was commissioned by UK Sport and Sport England to review allegations that British Gymnastics failed to address complaints for decades.Whyte received over 400 submissions and interviewed 190 people after her call for evidence in August 2020.In response to the review, British Gymnastics chief executive Sarah Powell admitted Thursday that the organization failed the sport of gymnastics and apologized on behalf of the sporting body.\u201cI wish to accept all of the recommendations and the key findings, and we will work hard to ensure that these are acted upon quickly and robustly,\u201d stated Powell.\u201cBut most importantly, I want to wholeheartedly apologize on behalf of the leadership and the board for those gymnasts who have suffered because we have not met the standards that are expected for our sport.\u201d\u201cWhen you do try to raise the alarm as a child and you\u2019re shut down, it makes you think that if you do speak out, you\u2019re not going to be believed,\u201d Heafford, who left the sport in 1995, told CNN.\u201cFrom that point on, I never watched gymnastics. I got the hell away from it. And I went into athletics, which is where I had wonderful experiences, and I loved every minute of being a track and field athlete. So it was only when I stopped competing that I started to get PTSD symptoms showing up from my time in gymnastics,\u201d she added.After distancing herself from the sport for years, Heafford now coaches adults in gymnastics, runs body positive gymnastics classes and campaigns for change in the sport \u2013 particularly for the recognition of historic abuse.Other gymnasts have been vocal in their support of the report\u2019s release. Two-time Olympian Becky Downie, who competed for Great Britain in the 2008 and 2016 Olympic Games, said the report \u201cfeels like a vindication for myself and so many who have known for so long of the serious cultural problems within the sport. A sport I love more than anything.\u201d\u201cFinally everyone knows the truth and while it won\u2019t directly benefit those who have experienced it, it\u2019s encouraging to know that if the recommendations are implemented, it\u2019ll protect and enhance the next generation of gymnasts,\u201d sheand Twitter.Whyte recommended systemic changes in her review, including calling on British Gymnastics to improve its complaints system by offering better guidance on how concerns should be investigated and strengthening how complaints are monitored so that patterns of abuse can be better recognized.Whyte also recommended that British Gymnastics reassess the level of responsibility delegated to volunteers and employ trained, expert staff, as well as introducing mandatory safeguarding training for all club owners and managers.She added that British Gymnastics must appoint board members with expertise in promoting the welfare of children and protecting them from harm, as well as a director of education with responsibility for the education of coaches and welfare officers.Downie added: \u201cWhile it\u2019ll never make what has been allowed to happen to myself and so many others ok, it has been made clear us athletes have been heard, and I\u2019m overwhelmingly encouraged for the future of young gymnasts in this country.\u201dUK Sport and Sport England said they accepted and endorsed the review\u2019s recommendations, and that they would continue to support British Gymnastics.\u201cAt this time, our intention is to continue to fund British Gymnastics, as we believe that withdrawing funding would not only prevent them from implementing the vital changes outlined in the report but also negatively impact on the support to and wellbeing of gymnasts now,\u201d the joint UK Sport and Sport England statement reads.\u201cHowever, we are clear that continued funding for British Gymnastics will depend on its new leadership team making significant changes to the sport, to the timelines set out in the report\u2019s recommendations.\u201dThis week, 18-year-old former elite acrobatic gymnast Eloise Jotischky won the first civil case against British Gymnastics for the abuse she said she experienced at the hands of a coach.She and Heafford are among a group of 39 plaintiffs involved in civil cases focusing on historic abuse by coaches who fell under the auspices of British Gymnastics, according to a representative for Gymnastics for Change.British Gymnastics admitted full liability in Jotischky\u2019s case and reached a settlement with the former gymnast, whom the BBCalso received an apology from the chief executive of the organization.Jotischky, who said her coach subjected her to inappropriate weight management techniques and verbal harassment, told CNN Sport in an email she was glad the report had \u201cfinally exposed the catastrophic safeguarding failures that led to the abuse of hundreds of gymnasts.\u201dIn the report, Whyte highlighted submissions detailing how \u201csome coaches went to damaging lengths to control what gymnasts ate and weighed, to the extent of searching luggage and rooms for food. As a result, some gymnasts suffered from (and still suffer from) eating disorders and associated mental health issues.\u201dJotischky, who competed in the sport between the ages of eight and 14, told CNN Sport she was encouraged that British Gymnastics intended to implement the report\u2019s recommendations.But she expressed concern, saying that \u201cmore needs to be done to address and reform the endemic culture of abuse that has been so deeply ingrained within the sport.\u201dIn particular, Jotischky said she believes a register of coaches is critical: \u201cWithout a register of coaches, parents will never know when their child is being coached by someone who has had allegations of abuse against them. The failures of the past have proved that parents should not be shut out, especially in a sport where the coaches are being entrusted with the welfare of young children.\u201dWhen approached for a comment on Jotischky\u2019s remarks, British Gymnastics declined to comment further.Jotischky said that, since becoming the first gymnast to win her legal case against British Gymnastics, she has been overwhelmed by the number of gymnasts who have contacted her to share their experiences.\u201cIt shows there are so many gymnasts who are afraid to speak out publicly and that must change,\u201d she said.Heafford agreed.\u201cThe reality is that national governing bodies operate within a vacuum from a legal point of view. And the only thing that will bring actual cultural change to sport generally and specifically to the sport of gymnastics is legislative change,\u201d she said, adding that she is calling for mandatory reporting whereby parents, gymnasts and coaches within training facilities would legally be required to report any abuse they observed.Heafford said that it was difficult for survivors to speak up, adding \u201cthere is such defensiveness within the culture of gymnastics.\u201d\u201cYou know that as a gymnast, if you speak out about culture, there will be repercussions. You\u2019ll be ostracized from the community, so it\u2019s not an easy thing to do,\u201d she said.UK Sport and Sport England referred CNN to last week\u2019s joint statement when approached for further comment.The report comes as gymnastics institutions worldwide have been forced to reckon with claims of abuse and safeguarding failures following an outpouring of survivor testimony.In March, more than 70 former and current gymnasts in Canadainto \u201congoing toxic and abusive practices\u201d gymnasts are allegedly subject to in the country.In an open letter addressed to Sport Canada, the athletes have called for the governing body to conduct an \u201cindependent, third-party investigation.\u201dAt the time, GymCan said it was aware of the letter being circulated and agreed that an external and independent organization must be established to oversee complaints.Canadian gymnasts allege 'abuse, neglect and discrimination' within the sportIn May, GymCan and its Provincial Member Organizations said they had been informed by the media of a proposed class action lawsuit, filed with the Supreme Court of British Columbia, in which they are named as defendants.\u201cAlthough we have not been served, the allegations we have been made aware of in the claim describe behaviour that is unacceptable in any sport environment, and we take them very seriously,\u201d GymCan said in a, adding they are committed to addressing all allegations with \u201cdiligence and due process.\u201dThis comes four years after disgraced former USA Gymnastics doctor Larry Nassar was sentenced to up to 175 years in Michigan state prison after pleading guilty to seven counts of criminal sexual conduct.At the sentencing, 156 victims, including Olympic gold medalists Aly Raisman and McKayla Maroney, recounted stories of how they went to Nassar to receive treatment for sports injuries, only to be sexually assaulted and told it was a form of treatment.Attorneys for more than 90 women and girls who were sexually abused by Nassar, saying investigators could have ended Nassar\u2019s predation and protected other victims had they not mishandled the case.The claimants include Olympic gymnasts Simone Biles, Raisman and Maroney and world championship medalist Maggie Nichols. Each has asked for $50 million, according to the law firm that represents them.CNN this month contacted the Department of Justice, which oversees the FBI, and officials there declined to comment."

        "text": "Omie Dale has fond memories of splashing in the sea as a child, of racing through water parks and swimming in backwaters and rivers.\u201cThere\u2019s so much joy that can be had once you learn to swim, once you\u2019ve abandoned those fears and you can get in the water,\u201d the 25-year-old Dale, who is based in southeast London, tells.Even though swimming is a joyful experience for Dale, the stark reality is that many Black communities in Britain and the US do not have safe access to swimming lessons and public pools due to historic racism and segregation \u2013 a problem that is especially alarming given that, as Dale says, it is \u201cthe only sport that can save your life.\u201dThe lack of access afforded to Black communities in Britain is what motivated Dale to become a swimming teacher in September 2019.\u201cI used to work in Kensington (in London) as a lifeguard and some of the richest people live in that borough, but also some of the poorest,\u201d she says. She saw there was a difference when private schools and independent schools would come in and all the kids were able to swim, yet hardly any children of the same age that Dale saw from state schools could swim 25 meters.\u201cThere\u2019s a real class barrier in the sport of swimming,\u201d Dale adds.She is a director of, a collective offering free swimming lessons to women and children in North Kensington, West London.It was born in the wake of thein 2017, when a residential block caught on fire, killing 72 people \u2013 and leaving many more without homes.\u201cThere\u2019s like a lot of people who come to swim lessons \u2026 who have undergone some form of trauma, whether that be water-related trauma or trauma related to their everyday lives,\u201d Dale says.\u201cMany people say it\u2019s like an escape from their daily lives or is, actually, the first time that they\u2019ve taken time for themselves.\u201dWhile 77% of children from the most affluent families in England can swim 25 meters unaided, only 34% from the least affluent families can, according to afrom Sport England, a non-departmental public body that fosters grassroots sports in England.About 95% of Black adults and 80% of Black children in England do not regularly participate in swimming, according to Sport England\u2019s, published in January 2020.Likewise, about 93% of Asian adults and 78% of Asian children, including those with Indian, Pakistani and Bangladeshi heritage, do not regularly participate in swimming, the same research found.This trend extends to the US, where nearly 64% of Black children have \u201clow\u201d or no ability to swim, compared with 40% of their White peers, according tofrom the country\u2019s national governing body for the sport at a competitive level, USA Swimming.The underrepresentation of Black people in the pool in the US can beto the early 20th century.Public swimming pools became popular in North America in the 1920s and 30s and were initially open to all. However, Northern politicians stipulated a \u201cWhites Only\u201d rule, referencing racist fears about Black men fraternizing with White women.Even after legal racial segregation ended in the US in 1964, public pools continued to be hostile environments. As people of color began to use public pools, White swimmers retreated to the privacy of their own pools and private clubs, where expensive fees continue to be an economic barrier for Black families who cannot afford the cost.Similar examples in Britain illustrate how racial and class inequalities lead to the systemic exclusion of Black people in pools. For example, more thanin the UK live in ethnically diverse communities where Covid-19 national lockdowns resulted in the closure or mothballing of pools, according to Swim England \u2013 England\u2019s national swimming governing body \u2013 and the Black Swimming Association (BSA), a UK-based charity that aims to encourage more African, Caribbean and Asian communities to take up swimming.Globally, drowning is the third leading cause of accidental injury-related death and at least 236,000 people die each year from drowning, according tofrom the World Health Organization (WHO). Children are particularly affected, with drowning being one of the top five causes of death for those aged 1-14 years in 48 of 85 countries studied by the WHO.And while natural disasters and irregular migration are notorious risk factors, so are lower socioeconomic status, lack of higher education and being a member of an ethnic minority, depending on the country, WHO research shows.\u201cMost drowning incidents happen when people never intend to get into the water in the first place,\u201d says Dale, who was awarded Swim Teacher of the Year by Swim England in 2021.In December 2019, three members of the same Black British family \u2013 a 53-year-old father and his two children \u2013 died in a swimming pool at a resort in Costa del Sol, Spain,. The father and his 16-year-old son had reportedly leapt into the water to try to save his nine-year-old daughter, who was drowning.Danielle Obe is the co-founder and chair of the BSA. She told CNN Sport that the Costa del Sol deaths prompted her to establish the BSA in March 2020, alongside Olympic swimmer Alice Dearing, journalist Seren Jones and songwriter, rapper and producer Ed Accura.\u201cThis was devastating because these families were actually acquainted to me and they were from my local community,\u201d Obe says. \u201c(At) that point, I called Alice and Seren, and I said, \u2018We\u2019ve been talking about doing something for our community. We\u2019ve got to do something. We\u2019ve got to do it now. We cannot keep recovering bodies.\u2019\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ve got to do something. We\u2019ve got to do it now. We cannot keep recovering bodies.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s no longer just about that lack of representation,\u201d Obe adds.\u201cIt\u2019s now about saving lives, vital water safety, education for all. Swimming is an intervention. Swimming is a life skill.\u201dHowever, there is still a lack of data when it comes to drowning-related deaths by ethnicity in the UK, says Obe.\u201cAt the moment, we don\u2019t know how much of a disparity there is between drowning and fatalities, aquatic fatalities for different communities in the UK because, up until now, drowning data isn\u2019t really captured by ethnicity, which is another point, another issue that the BSA is looking to tackle.\u201dDearing, the first Black female swimmer towhen she competed at Tokyo 2020, \u201cimplores\u201d people to learn to swim.\u201cI have been quite torn between the amazing achievement of being the first Black woman to represent GB in swimming but wanting to be my own person, my own athlete, who\u2019s known for being an athlete and not for her race and her sport combined together,\u201d she tells CNN Sport.\u201cI take the two of them just as they are \u2013 kind of like separate things. I\u2019m trying to be the best athlete and best role model that I can be to show people that they can do the sport, that the sport is for everybody.\u201dAt the age of 24, Dearing was making history in Japan and became a beacon of hope for young people \u2013 especially Black girls \u2013 who wanted to break into the sport.But her personal triumph also drew attention to the institutional access gap for people of color in swimming.\u201cFortunately, for myself, I haven\u2019t come across any barriers at the level I\u2019m at currently,\u201d Dearing says.\u201cBut I have faced barriers when I was younger and issues where people just don\u2019t think Black people should swim, or do swim, or think that we\u2019re better suited to other sports and so shouldn\u2019t even learn to swim or attempt swimming in the first place.\u201dCNN reached out to the International Swimming Federation (FINA), Sport England and USA Swimming requesting a breakdown of Black and ethnic minority participation in swimming at grassroots and professional levels of the sport. However, they told CNN they were unable to provide such data.FINA \u2013 the global governing body for swimming \u2013 told CNN it does not have a breakdown of the ethnicities of swimmers at a grassroots or elite level.FINA said in 2021 it allocated $6.6 million towards development programs for distribution among all national federations and continental associations, while also pushing for diversity in the sport through its \u201cSwimming for All, Swimming for Life\u201d program.\u201cFINA remains fully committed to non-discrimination,\u201d the organization said to CNN in a statement. \u201cFINA continues to work hard to ensure that the global aquatics community is a place where all athletes, coaches and administrators are treated equally.\u201cWork will continue to develop and grow with the support of members of the aquatics community as we strive to be at the forefront of this essential area,\u201d FINA added.\u201cI have faced barriers when I was younger and issues where people just don\u2019t think Black people should swim, or do swim, or think that we\u2019re better suited to other sports and so shouldn\u2019t even learn to swim or attempt swimming in the first place.\u201dSport England told CNN in a statement that it is \u201ccommitted to increasing investment in facilities and organisations across England to try to level up access to good quality sports and activities.\u201d\u201cBarriers to getting active persist and have even been exacerbated for some disadvantaged groups \u2013 like women, people with long-term health conditions, disabled people, people from ethnically diverse communities and lower socio-economic groups,\u201d the statement added.Sport England said in May it announced further funding that brings its total investment in its 121 partners to more than \u00a3550 million ($670 million), which they\u2019ve selected \u201cdue to their unique position to tackle entrenched activity inequalities and influence positive change throughout the sector, their own networks and beyond.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not all about the economic side of things. It is also about getting people to feel comfortable with putting their kids in swim lessons and in competitive swimming so that they can then go and do other aquatic-based sports,\u201d Joel Shinofield, the managing director of sport development at USA Swimming, told CNN during a phone call.USA Swimming is a membership-serviced organization that has over 3,100 clubs and more than 400,000 members, according to the.\u201cOur goal is to facilitate opportunities and make sure they\u2019re good ones. While our clubs are the ones that do that on the local level, the resources, guidance, support, financial investment that we provide can shift who those opportunities can be provided to and more broadly create access,\u201d he added.Shinofield said that USA Swimming has established a 10-year initiative that will grant $1 million to develop learn-to-swim and competitive opportunities for communities served by Historical Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs). The program was announced in 2021, according to the USA Swimming.From representing their organization at the UK\u2019s first Equality, Diversity and Inclusion Summit For Sport in Birmingham, Englandtoin Hackney \u2013 one of thein London \u2013 Obe hopes that the BSA will help bridge the barrier through community-level engagement.\u201cThat community engagement really is to build trust, accountability and collaboration with disenfranchised communities and the sector,\u201d says Obe.\u201cOnly in understanding these attitudes and understanding some of the barriers that preclude our communities from engaging in aquatics can we begin to drive change.\u201dIn August 2021, the BSA announced it would conduct awith the Royal National Lifeboat Institution and the University of Portsmouth, exploring the behaviors and barriers that prevent African, Caribbean and Asian communities from swimming.\u201cThere\u2019s so much joy that can be had once you learn to swim, once you\u2019ve abandoned those fears and you can get in the water.\u201dSpeaking about the program, Obe says: \u201cIt\u2019s important for us to inspire confidence with African, Caribbean and Asian communities, and the only way we\u2019re able to do that is to ensure that we understand where these communities are in the first place and understand why they don\u2019t engage in aquatics, why we don\u2019t see the representation pool side and why we don\u2019t even see the representation within some aquatic organizations.\u201dDale also volunteers with Mental Health Swims, a grassroots organization that facilitates swimming meet-ups for people struggling with their mental health. As part of her work for the organization, she coordinates swim events in south London to help swimmers access the mental health benefits of the sport. She also volunteers for, a network that aims to increase LGBTQ+ representation in swimming.Dearing says that despite the racial and economic barriers to swimming for African, Caribbean and Asian communities, she\u2019s still optimistic about the changing landscape of the sport.\u201cI really think if anything is going to change, it\u2019s going to be now, it\u2019s going to be over the next couple of years,\u201d she says. \u201cEach story is different, each person is different and has to be understood in their own way, and there\u2019s nothing wrong with that, that\u2019s just another challenge that we have to face and we\u2019re up for it.\u201cIt\u2019s tough \u2013 it\u2019s not a quick fix, but the future is bright.\u201cI like to feel that I\u2019m giving something back to swimming and, hopefully, giving something to the Black community to hopefully achieve, strive for and change the way that Black people are viewed in swimming and the way Black people view swimming.\u201cIt\u2019s a double-edged sword; I absolutely love doing it. Sometimes, it\u2019s really frightening and daunting, but if I\u2019m trying to make the world a better place, then sometimes you got to step out and scare yourself.\u201dCNN\u2019s Krystina Shveda contributed to this report."

        "text": "Kamal was standing outside a shop with other migrant workers, having finished yet another grueling working day, when he and \u2013 he says \u2013 a few others were arrested this August. Without explanation, the 24-year-old says he was put into a vehicle and, for the next week, kept in a Qatari jail, the location and name of which he does not know.\u201cWhen they arrested me, I couldn\u2019t say anything, not a single word, as I was so scared,\u201d he told, speaking at home in southern Nepal where he has been working on a farm since being deported three months ago.Kamal \u2013 CNN has changed the names of the Nepali workers to protect them from retaliation \u2013 is one of many migrant workers wanting to tell the world of their experiences in Qatar, a country that will this month host one of sport\u2019s greatest, most lucrative, spectacles \u2013 thea tournament which usually unites the world as millions watch the spectacular goals and carefully-choreographed celebrations.It will be a historic event, the first World Cup to be held in the Middle East, but one also mired in controversy. Much of the build-up to this tournament has been on more sober matters, that of human rights, from the deaths of migrant workers and the conditions many have endured in Qatar, to LGBTQ and women\u2019s rights.Kamal says he has yet to be paid the 7,000 Qatari Riyal bonus (around $1,922) he says he is entitled to from his previous employers, nor 7,000 Riyal in insurance for injuring two fingers at work.\u201cI wasn\u2019t told why I was being arrested. People are just standing there \u2026 some are walking with their grocery [sic], some are just sitting there consuming tobacco products \u2026 they just arrest you,\u201d he adds, before explaining he could not ask questions as he does not speak Arabic.Describing the conditions in the cell he shared with 24 other Nepali migrant workers, he says he was provided with a blanket and a pillow, but the mattress on the floor he had to sleep on was riddled with bed bugs.\u201cInside the jail, there were people from Sri Lanka, Kerala (India), Pakistan, Sudan, Nepal, African, Philippines. There were around 14-15 units. In one jail, there were around 250-300 people. Around 24-25 people per room,\u201d he says.\u201cWhen they take you to the jail, they don\u2019t give you a room right away. They keep you in a veranda. After a day or two, once a room is empty, they keep people from one country in one room.\u201dUsing a smuggled phone, he spoke to friends, one of whom, he says, brought his belongings \u2013 including his passport \u2013 to the jail, though he says he was sent home after the Nepali embassy had sent a paper copy of his passport to the jail. CNN has reached out to the embassy but has yet to receive a response.\u201cWhen they put me on the flight, I started thinking: \u2018Why are they sending workers back all of a sudden? It\u2019s not one, two, 10 people \u2026 they are sending 150, 200, 300 workers on one flight,\u2019\u201d he says.\u201cSome workers who were just roaming outside wearing (work) dress were sent back. They don\u2019t even allow you to collect your clothes. They just send you back in the cloth you are wearing.\u201dKamal believes he was arrested because he had a second job, which is illegal under Qatar\u2019sand allows authorities to cancel a worker\u2019s work permit. He says he worked an extra two to four hours a day to supplement his income as he was not making enough money working six eight-hour days a week.Qatar has a 90-day grace period in which a worker can remain in the country legally without another sponsor, but if they have not had their permit renewed or reactivated in that time they risk being arrested or deported for being undocumented.He says he received paperwork upon his arrest, which Amnesty International says would likely have explained why he was being detained, but as it was in Arabic he did not know what it said and no translator was provided.A Qatari government official told CNN in a statement: \u201cAny claims that workers are being jailed or deported without explanation are untrue. Action is only taken in very specific cases, such as if an individual participates in violence.\u201dThe official added that 97% of all eligible workers were covered by Qatar\u2019s Wage Protection System, established in 2018, \u201cwhich ensures wages are paid in full and on time.\u201d Further work was being done to strengthen the system, the official said.With the opening match just days away, on-the-pitch matters are a mere footnote because this tournament has come at a cost to workers who left their families in the belief that they would reap financial rewards in one of the world\u2019sSome would never return home. None of the three Nepali workers CNN spoke to were richer for their experience. Indeed, they are in debt and full of melancholy.The Guardian reported last year that 6,500 South Asian migrant workers have died in Qatar since the country was awarded the World Cup in 2010, most of whom were involved in low-wage, dangerous labor, often undertaken in extreme heat.The report did not connect all 6,500 deaths with World Cup infrastructure projects and has not been independently verified by CNN.Hassan Al Thawadi \u2013 the man in charge of leading Qatar\u2019s preparations \u2013 told CNN\u2019s Becky Anderson that the Guardian\u2019s 6,500 figure was athat was misleading and that the report lacked context.A government official told CNN there had been three work-related deaths on stadiums and. In a statement, the official said the Guardian\u2019s figures were \u201cinaccurate\u201d and \u201cwildly misleading.\u201d\u201cThe 6,500 figure takes the number of all foreign worker deaths in the country over a 10-year period and attributes it to the World Cup,\u201d the official said. \u201cThis is not true and neglects all other causes of death including illness, old age and traffic accidents. It also fails to recognize that only 20% of foreign workers in Qatar are employed on construction sites.\u201dIt has beenthat Qatar has spent $220 billion leading up to the tournament, which would make it the most expensive World Cup in history, though this likely includes infrastructure not directly associated with stadium construction. A spokesperson for the Supreme Committee for Delivery & Legacy (SC) which, since its formation in 2011, has been responsible for overseeing the infrastructure projects and planning for the World Cup, told CNN that the tournament budget was $6.5 billion, without expanding on what that cost covered.Eight new stadiums rose from the desert, and the Gulf state expanded its airport, constructed new hotels, rail and highways. All would have been constructed by migrant workers, who \u2013 according to\u2013 account for 90% of the workforce in a near-three million population.Since 2010, migrant workers have faced delayed or unpaid wages, forced labor, long hours in hot weather, employer intimidation and an inability to leave their jobs because of the country\u2019s sponsorship system, human rights organizations have found.However, the health, safety and dignity of \u201call workers employed on our projects has remained steadfast,\u201d a statement from the SC read.\u201cOur efforts have resulted in significant improvements in accommodation standards, health and safety regulations, grievance mechanisms, healthcare provision and reimbursements of illegal recruitment fees to workers.\u201cWhile the journey is on-going, we are committed to delivering the legacy we promised. A legacy that improves lives and lays the foundation for fair, sustainable and lasting labour reforms.\u201dLast year, in an interview with CNN Sport anchor Amanda Davies, FIFA President Gianni Infantino said that while \u201cmore needs to be done,\u201d progress had been made.\u201cI\u2019ve seen the great evolution that has happened in Qatar, which was recognized \u2013 I mean not by FIFA \u2013 but by labor unions around the world, by international organizations,\u201d said Infantino.We are, unusually, writing about a World Cup in November because the competition had to be moved from its usual June-July slot to Qatar\u2019s winter as the heat is so extreme in the country\u2019s summer months \u2013 temperatures can reach around 43 degrees Celsius (109 degrees Fahrenheit) in June \u2013 that playing in such conditions could have posed a health risk to players.Hari is 27 years old and, like many of his compatriots, left Nepal for Qatar as his family \u2013 he was one of five siblings with just his father at home \u2013 desperately needed money, primarily to eat. Since 2013, Nepal\u2019s government-mandated minimum wage has been set at $74 a month, according toHe says that his monthly wage in Qatar was 700 Rial a month ($192).After moving to Qatar in 2014, he worked in four places during his four-year stay: at a supermarket, a hotel and airport, but the most difficult job, he says, was in construction when he had to carry tiles up buildings \u201csix to seven stories above\u201d in overbearing heat, plus lay pipelines in deep pits.\u201cIt was too hot,\u201d he tells CNN. \u201cThe foreman was very demanding and used to complain a lot. The foreman used to threaten to reduce our salaries and overtime pay.\u201cI had to carry tiles on my shoulder to the top. It was very difficult going up through the scaffolding. In the pipeline work, there were 5-7 meters deep pits, we had to lay the stones and concrete, it was difficult due to the heat. It was difficult to breathe. We had to come upstairs using a ladder to drink water.\u201cIt never happened to me, but I saw some workers fainting at work. I saw one Bengali, one Nepali \u2026 two to three people faint while working. They took the Bengali to medical services. I\u2019m not sure what happened to him.\u201dDuring his time in Qatar, government regulations generally prohibited workers from working outdoors between 11:30 a.m. and 3 p.m. from June 15 to August 31. He said one company he worked for followed these rules.He added: \u201cAt some places, they didn\u2019t have water. Some places, they didn\u2019t provide us water on time. At some places, we used to go to houses nearby asking for water.\u201dWorking long hours in extreme heat has, some non-governmental organizations believe, caused a number of deaths and put lives at risk in Qatar.In 2019, research published in the, exploring the relationship between the deaths of more than 1,300 Nepali workers between 2009 and 2017 and heat exposure, found a \u201cstrong correlation\u201d between heat stress and young workers dying of cardiovascular problems in the summer months.The government official told CNN that there had been a \u201cconsistent decline\u201d in the mortality rate of migrant workers, including a decline in heat stress disorders, \u201cthanks in large part to our comprehensive heat stress legislation.\u201d\u201cQatar has always acknowledged that work remains to be done, notably to hold unscrupulous employers to account,\u201d the government official added. \u201cSystemic reform does not happen overnight and shifting the behavior of every company takes time as is the case with any country around the world.\u201dNatasha Iskander, Professor of Urban Planning and Public Service at New York University, tells CNN that heat can kill \u201cin ways that are confusing and unclear.\u201d\u201cFatal heat stroke can look like a heart attack or a seizure. Sometimes, heat kills through the body, amplifying manageable and often silent conditions, like diabetes and hypertension, and turning them into sudden killers,\u201d she explains.\u201cAs a result, Qatar, in the death certificates that it has issued after migrant construction workers have collapsed, has been able to push back against the correlation between heat stress and deaths and claim instead that the deaths are due to natural causes, even though the more proximate cause is work in the heat.\u201dDetermining the number of workers injured by heat is even harder, she says, because many injuries may not become apparent until years later, when migrants have returned home and young men \u201cfind that their kidneys no longer function, that they suffer from chronic kidney disease, or that their hearts have begun to fail, displaying levels of cardiac weakness that are debilitating.\u201d\u201cHeat does not typically injure on its own,\u201d she adds. \u201cWorkers are exposed to heat and heat dangers through the labor relations on Qatari worksites. The long hours, physically intense work, the forced overtime, the abusive conditions, the bullying on site all shape how exposed workers are to heat. Additionally, conditions beyond the worksite also augmented heat\u2019s power to harm \u2013 things like poor sleep, insufficient nutrition or a room that was not cool enough to allow the body to reset after a day in the heat. In Qatar, the employer housed workers in labor camps, and workers as a matter of policy were segregated to industrial areas, where living accommodations were terrible.\u201dAccording toQatari authorities have not investigated \u201cthousands\u201d of deaths of migrant workers over the past decade \u201cdespite evidence of links between premature deaths and unsafe working conditions.\u201d That these deaths are not being recorded as work-related prevents families from receiving compensation, the advocacy group states.In its statement, the SC said that its commitment to publicly disclose non-work-related deaths went beyond the requirements of the UK\u2019s Health and Safety Executive Reporting of Injuries, Diseases and Dangerous Occurrences regulations (RIDDOR), which defines and provides classification for how to document work-related and non-work-related incidents.The statement added: \u201cThe SC investigates all non-work-related deaths and work-related fatalities in line with our Incident Investigation Procedure to identify contributory factors and establish how they could have been prevented. This process involves evidence collection and analysis and witness interviews to establish the facts of the incident.\u201dAmnesty International\u2019s Ella Knight told CNN Sport that her organization would continue to push Qatar to \u201cthoroughly investigate\u201d deaths of migrant workers, including past deaths, to \u201censure the families of the deceased have the opportunity to rebuild their lives.\u201dBarun Ghimire is a human rights lawyer based in Kathmandu whose work focuses on the exploitation of Nepali migrants working abroad. He tells CNN that the families he advocates for have not received satisfactory information on their loved ones\u2019 deaths. \u201cFamilies send out healthy, young family member to work and they receive news that the family member died when they were sleeping,\u201d he says. In ahe told CNN last year: \u201cThe Qatar World Cup is really the bloody cup \u2013 the blood of migrant workers.\u201dLast year,was strengthened regarding outdoor working conditions, expanding summertime working hours during which outdoor work is prohibited \u2013 replacing legislation introduced in 2007 \u2013 and additionally putting into law that \u201call work must stop if the wet-bulb globe temperature (WBGT) raises beyond 32.1C (89.8F) in a particular workplace.\u201d The regulations also mandate annual health checks for workers, as well as mandatory risk assessments.\u201cWe recognize that heat stress is a particular issue in the summer months in Qatar,\u201d a Qatari government official said. \u201cIn May 2021, Qatar introduced a requirement for companies to conduct annual health checks for workers, as well as mandatory risk assessments to mitigate the dangers of heat stress. Companies are expected to adopt flexible, self-monitored working hours where possible, adjust shift rotations, enforce regular breaks, provide free cold drinking water and shaded workspaces, and adhere to all other guidelines with respect to heat stress outlined by the Ministry of Labour.\u201cEvery summer, Qatar\u2019s labor inspectors carry out thousands of unannounced visits to work sites across the country to ensure that heat stress rules are being followed,\u201d the official added. \u201cBetween June and September 2022, 382 work sites were ordered to close for violating the rules.\u201dIskander said a heat point of 32.1C WBGT was \u201calready dangerous.\u201d\u201cWorking at the physical intensity that construction workers do in Qatar for any amount of time at that temperature is damaging to the body,\u201d she explained.\u201cThe regulation relied on the assumption that workers would be able to self-pace and rest as needed whenever they experienced heat stress. Anyone who has ever spent any amount of time on a Qatari construction site knows that workers have no ability to self-pace.\u201dKnight adds: \u201cThe fact investigations into migrant workers deaths are often not happening precludes the possibility of greater protections being implemented because if you don\u2019t know what is really happening to these people how can you then implement and enforce effective measures to increase their protection?\u201dFor the majority of his time in Qatar, Hari said he felt sad. He would watch planes take off during his six months tending the airport gardens and question why he was in the country. But he had paid 90,000 Nepali rupees ($685) to a Nepali recruitment company that facilitated his move. He was also told, he says, by the company he had joined that he would have had to pay 2,000 to 3,000 Riyal ($549-$823) to buy himself out of his contract.His friends, he said, counseled him as he continued to work long, lonely days for, Hari says, not enough money to live and save for his family.says many migrants pay high fees to \u201cunscrupulous recruitment agents in their home country\u201d which make the workers scared to leave their jobs when they get to Qatar.Now, he is a father-of-two, and work is plowing fields in Nepal as a tractor driver, but Hari hopes one day to work abroad again, his heart set on Malaysia. \u201cI don\u2019t want my children to go through what I did. I want to build a house, buy some land. That\u2019s what I am thinking. But let\u2019s see what God has planned,\u201d he says.Sunit has been back in Nepal since August after working just eight months in Qatar. He had expected to be there for two years, but the collapse of the construction company he worked for meant he and many others returned with money still owed to them, he says. He struggles to find work in Nepal, meaning feeding his two children and paying school fees is difficult.He had dreamed of watching World Cup matches from the rooftop of the hotel he had helped build. One of the stadiums \u2013 the name of which he does not know \u2013 was a 10-minute walk from the hotel. \u201cWe used to talk about it,\u201d he says of the World Cup. \u201cBut we had to return, and our dreams never came true. The stadium activities were visible from the hotel. We could see the stadium from the hotel rooftop.\u201dIn helping construct the city center hotel, the name of which he doesn\u2019t remember, he would carry bags of plaster mix and cement, weighing from 30 to 50 kilos, on his shoulders up to 10 to 12 floors, he says.\u201cThe lift was rarely functional. Some people couldn\u2019t carry it and dropped it halfway. If you don\u2019t finish your job, you were threatened saying the salary would be deducted for that day,\u201d he says. \u201cThe foreman used to complain that we were taking water breaks as soon as we got to work. They used to threaten us saying: \u2018We will not pay you for the day.\u2019 We said: \u2018Go ahead. We are humans, we need to drink water.\u2019\u201cIt was very hot. It used to take 1.5 to two hours to get to the top. I used to get tired. I used to stop on the way. Then proceed again slowly. Yes, the supervisors used to yell at us. But what could we do?\u201dHe says he had paid an agent in Nepal 240,000 Nepali rupees (around $1,840) before leaving for Qatar. He says he has filed a case with the police about the agent as he had been unable to fulfill his two-year contract, but there have been no developments. He says the owners of the company he worked for in Qatar were arrested because they did not pay laborers. The company did not immediately respond to CNN\u2019s request for comment, neither did it respond to questions from the Business & Human Rights Centre, an advocacy group, about protests over unpaid wages.For a month, he says, he was in his accommodation with no work or money to buy food \u2013 he borrowed to eat \u2013 so he and his fellow workers called the police, who brought food with them.\u201cThe police came again after 10-15 days and said we have arrested the company people. (The police) distributed food again,\u201d he says. \u201cThey told us the company has collapsed and the government will send all the workers back home.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m extremely sad,\u201d he adds. \u201cI mean, it is what it is. Nothing would change by regretting it. I get mad (at the company) but what can I do? Even if I had tried to fight back, it would have been my loss.\u201dThe SC said it has established what it claims is a \u201cfirst-of-its-kind\u201d Workers\u2019 Welfare Forum, which it said allowed workers to elect a representative on their behalf and, when companies failed to comply with the WWF, it steps in, demands better and alerts the authorities.Since 2016, the SC said 69 contractors had been demobilized, 235 contractors placed on a watch list and a further seven blacklisted. \u201cWe understand there is always room for improvement,\u201d the statement added.Qatar, a peninsula smaller than Connecticut and the smallest World Cup host in history, is set to host an estimated 1.5 million fans over the month-long tournament, which begins on November 20. There are already reports offor such a vast number of visitors.The spotlight is no doubt on this Gulf state, as has progressively been the case since it was controversially awarded the tournament over a decade ago \u2013 though Qatari officials have previouslyto CNN the allegations of bribery which has surrounded its bid.Such attention has brought about reforms, significantly dismantling thewhich gives companies and private citizens control over migrant workers\u2019 employment and immigration status.In Qatar, migrant workers can now change jobs freely without permission from their employer. But Knight adds: \u201cAnother aspect of the Kafala system, the criminal charge of absconding still exists, and this, along with other tools that are still available to employers, means that, fundamentally, the power balance between workers and employers, the imbalance remains great.\u201dKnight says unpaid wages is still an issue as the wage protection system \u201clacks enforcement mechanisms,\u201d while she also says employers can cancel a worker\u2019s ID at a \u201cpush of a button,\u201d meaning they risk arrest and deportation. Additionally, labor committees intended to help workers are under-resourced and \u201clack the capacity to deal with the number of cases that are coming to them.\u201dGhimire agrees that there have been a few positive changes to employment laws but adds that it is \u201cmore show and tell.\u201d\u201cMany workers who work in construction are untouched, so there\u2019s still exploitation going on,\u201d he tells CNN.Qatar\u2019s government official told CNN work remained to be done but that \u201csystemic reform does not happen overnight, and shifting the behavior of every company takes time as is the case with any country around the world.\u201cOver the last decade, Qatar has done more than any other country in the region to strengthen the rights of foreign workers, and we will continue to work in close consultation with international partners to strengthen reforms and enforcement.\u201dHuman Rights Watch\u2019swants Qatar and FIFA to pay at least $440 million \u2013 an amount equal to the prize money being awarded at the World Cup \u2013 to the families of migrant workers who have been harmed or killed in preparation for the tournament.Families of workers who have died face uncertain futures,especially children. Those who survived and returned home, cheated of wages or injured, remain trapped in debt, it says, \u201cwith dire consequences for their families.\u201dGhimire says compensation is key, but so too is making the world aware of what has taken place to make this tournament happen.\u201cPeople are concerned about clothing brands, and the meat they eat, but what about mega events? Isn\u2019t it time we ask how this was possible?\u201d he asks.\u201cEveryone who will watch should know at what cost this was even possible and how workers were treated. Players should know, sponsors should know.\u201cWould it be the same situation if it was European workers dying in Qatar? If it was Argentinean workers, would Argentina be concerned about playing?\u201cBecause it\u2019s migrant workers from poor south Asian countries, they\u2019re invisible people. Forced labor, death of workers, while making a World Cup is unacceptable. As a football fan, it makes me sad; as a lawyer, it makes me really disappointed.\u201dEarlier this month, Qatar\u2019s Labor Minister Ali bin Samikh Al Marrithe prospect of a remedy fund.A Qatar government official said the country\u2019s Workers\u2019 Support and Insurance Fund was \u201ceffective in providing compensation for workers and their families\u201d with the fund reimbursing workers with more than $350 million so far this year.In terms of the SC\u2019s efforts to ensure repayment of recruitment fees, as of December 2021, workers have received $22.6 million, with an additional $5.7 million committed by contractors, according to FIFA.Last month,Deputy Secretary General Alasdair Bell said \u201ccompensation is certainly something that we\u2019re interested in progressing.\u201dIt has been widely reported that FIFA has urged nations participating in the World Cup to focus on football when the tournament kicks off.FIFA confirmed to CNN that a letter signed by FIFA President Gianni Infantino and the governing body\u2019s secretary general Fatma Samoura was sent out on November 3 to the 32 nations participating in the global showpiece but would not divulge the contents. However, a number ofhave issued a joint statement saying they would campaign at the tournament on human rights and for a migrant workers center and a compensation fund for migrant workers.The motto for Qatar\u2019s bid team in 2010 was \u2018Expect Amazing.\u2019 In many ways, this year\u2019s World Cup has replicated that maxim.As NYU\u2019s Iskander says: \u201cOne of the things that is not really covered in the coverage of the World Cup and the coverage of this enormous construction boom is the expertise and heroism of the workers who built it.\u201cThey built buildings that were unimaginable to everyone, including the engineers and designers, until they were built. They performed acts of bravery that are unsung. They operated at levels of technical complexity and sophistication that are unparalleled. And yet their contribution to building the World Cup is really rarely featured, downplayed.\u201cThey are represented, generally speaking, as exploited and oppressed. And it\u2019s true that they have been exploited and oppressed, but they are also the master craftsmen that built this Cup, and they are enormously proud of what they have built.\u201dHosting this tournament has undoubtedly put Qatar under the global spotlight. The question is whether the world can enjoy watching what the migrant workers built, knowing the true cost of this billion-dollar extravaganza."

        "link": "https://edition.cnn.com/2022/05/11/sport/zhou-jihong-diving-fina-spt-intl/index.html",
        "text": "For Lisa Wright, an elite-level diving judge from New Zealand, it was supposed to be the highlight of her career \u2013 the chance to adjudicate at the sport\u2019s premier event at the.But the scenes that unfolded after the men\u2019s 10-meter platform final in Tokyo last year \u201cdarkened\u201d her Olympic experience for some time, Wright says.They also led to an official complaint being lodged by Diving New Zealand and Wright against Zhou Jihong \u2013 a vice-president of water sports governing body FINA and one of the most influential figures in diving \u2013 on the grounds of harassment and abuse.That was after Zhou, who has been dubbed the \u201cIron Lady\u201d of Chinese diving, allegedly launched a verbal tirade at Wright at the 10m platform event\u2019s conclusion for underscoring Chinese divers.\u201cShe was on poolside screaming at me and yelling at me \u2013 it was definitely one of the most humiliating experiences of my life,\u201d Wright tells.Zhou was later ordered by a FINA Ethics Panel to write a letter of apology to Wright.However, some members of the diving community view Zhou\u2019s actions at the Olympics as a flashpoint amid a wider pattern of conduct they believe is harmful to the sport.One of those who holds that belief is New Zealander Simon Latimer, a former diver and judge and now a member of FINA\u2019s Diving Technical Committee (TDC).Following the incident at the Olympics, Latimer sent a whistleblower complaint to FINA\u2019s executive director Brent Nowicki in December detailing Zhou\u2019s alleged \u201cunethical behavior\u201d which he says stretches back several years and \u201ccompromises the integrity of both diving and FINA.\u201dThis contains allegations that Zhou has routinely coached Chinese divers during major events \u2013 including the Tokyo Olympics \u2013 and has manipulated judging panels in order to benefit Chinese athletes.Zhou has not spoken publicly about these allegations. CNN has contacted the General Administration of Sport of China and the Chinese Swimming Association for a response from Zhou but has not received a response.Latimer\u2019s complaint also focused on the events after the men\u2019s 10m platform final last year, an incident he says he witnessed and describes as a \u201cpersonal outburst\u201d from Zhou towards Wright.\u201cPart of making this complaint is to ensure that an incident like that \u2026 never happens again,\u201d Latimer tells CNN Sport. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of things to consider around athlete welfare, but we also need to consider the welfare of officials.\u201dThe final concluded with Chinese divers Cao Yuan and Yang Jian winning gold and silver medals respectively and Great Britain\u2019s Tom Daley securing bronze.Wright then approached Zhou to offer her congratulations on China\u2019s success, but says she was met with a barrage of verbal abuse and the allegation that she hadn\u2019t judged to an appropriate standard and had underscored Chinese athletes.\u201cI just said I\u2019m sorry you feel that way and I left and ended up crying in the bathroom, which was definitely not how you want to end your premier event of the Olympics,\u201d says Wright.\u201cIt was pretty traumatic for me, to be honest, especially given the fact that everyone knows that she\u2019s the vice president of FINA.\u201dOf some consolation for Wright was the support she received from other diving officials, who she says agreed with how she had scored athletes in the competition.Moreover, the event\u2019s independent assessor \u2013 responsible for monitoring the scores given by the judging panel \u2013 had agreed with her scoring on two occasions in which she gave a Chinese diver lower scores compared to her peers.In a diving event, judges on the panel award each dive a score ranging from zero to 10. Every FINA event has an assessor who watches replays of the dives, checks for bias in the judging, and evaluates the scores the judges are awarding.Wright says she had no interest in making a \u201cpersonal complaint\u201d or \u201cretaliation\u201d against Zhou, but was also aware of what might happen if no investigation was launched by diving\u2019s authorities.She believes Zhou would have the power and influence to exclude her from judging panels.\u201cIn the end, I think my biggest question was: what am I in this sport for and what am I here for?\u201d Wright says.\u201cI felt that it was important that we do the best thing for the sport of diving, that it remains fair, because that\u2019s what I\u2019m here for as a judge: that I rank those divers in the order that they should be ranked.\u201dIn November, the FINA Ethics Panel ordered Zhou to formally apologize to Wright and Diving New Zealand for the incident.Wright says she received the letter of apology, \u201cappreciated\u201d it, but \u201cdidn\u2019t feel like it was something personal\u201d given Zhou had been instructed to send it.The panel also ruled that only members of the TDC should be allowed on pool deck during competitions and that Zhou\u2019s Bureau Liaison position \u2013 traditionally tasked with taking the views of the TDC back to the FINA bureau \u2013 creates \u201cconfusion, conflict and discord\u201d and \u201cshould be removed.\u201dIn his whistleblower complaint, which has been shared with CNN Sport, Latimer alleges that Zhou has provided coaching to Chinese athletes at international diving events \u2013 including the FINA World Championships and the Diving World Series, as well as the Olympics \u2013 despite her roles requiring neutrality.\u201cIt\u2019s absolutely unethical \u2026 if you are up coaching divers from your own nation, I don\u2019t see how you could be viewed as a neutral party,\u201d says Latimer.\u201cI also can\u2019t think of any other sport where you would have a vice president on pool deck coaching and having such an open interest in the proceedings.\u201dSince the Olympics,has emerged reportedly showing Zhou coaching Chinese divers at the Games, while another TDC member, Colleen Huffman, says she has witnessed Zhou coaching at other international events.\u201cA lot of times she\u2019s very subtle about it, but obviously at the Olympics she wasn\u2019t subtle at all,\u201d Huffman tells CNN Sport.\u201cFor her to have her position and be a coach is a huge conflict of interest. It\u2019s one thing if she helps out at home with the national team, but it\u2019s another thing if she\u2019s actively coaching an athlete at a major FINA event when she\u2019s the Bureau Liaison.\u201dIn a statement sent to CNN Sport, TDC member Dominique Philippopoulos said she has twice requested to coach divers from her native South Africa at international events, but on both occasions had her requests denied by FINA officials on the grounds it was a conflict of interest.That\u2019s despite coming from a country where the sport of diving is small and the obstacles are many.According to Philippopoulos, the South African diving federation has limited resources and struggles to finance overseas trips and to cover the cost of coaches.A third allegation made by Latimer in his whistleblower complaint is that Zhou has deliberately manipulated judging panels in an apparent attempt to benefit Chinese divers.\u201cTwo judges have confidentially advised me that they believe they are regularly disregarded to judge finals as punishment for not judging Chinese divers as favourably as Zhou Jihong would like,\u201d he wrote.\u201cOne judge informed me that Zhou Jihong approached them at a World Cup Event in 2018 and asked \u2018why do you not like China?\u2019\u201dAccording to Latimer, Zhou has \u201csubstantial input\u201d when it comes to deciding which judges are chosen to officiate at competitions.He cites his own experience as a judge at the 2016 Rio Olympics, ahead of which he says he had been awarded the highest cumulative evaluation score from assessors among international judges through 2015-2016.But he alleges in his whistleblower complaint that he \u201cfell out of favor\u201d as a judge during the Olympics and was only reinstated for the men\u2019s platform final when members of the TDC Commission \u201cconvinced Zhou Jihong\u201d to reappoint him.\u201cWhat concerns me and some others is that judges appointed to finals aren\u2019t always the ones that appear to be assessed most highly,\u201d says Latimer.\u201cThere\u2019s certainly a discrepancy in some judges with very high evaluations getting very few appointments.\u201dSince making his whistleblower complaint, Latimer says he has received a response from FINA saying the governing body won\u2019t look into the issues he raised as they were already considered during the previous complaint submitted by Wright and Diving New Zealand.However, allegations about Zhou manipulating judging panels and coaching during events were not directly mentioned in the Ethics Panel\u2019s response to that initial complaint.These issues, Latimer says, are being \u201cswept under the carpet\u201d by FINA.In a statement sent to CNN, FINA said: \u201cThe reports regarding Ms Jihong Zhou were fully investigated by an independent panel that heard from witnesses and reached a decision which is publicly available on the.\u201cThe independent panel concluded that there was no evidence to suggest that competition results were impacted in any way and to our knowledge, no further formal allegations have been made beyond what has been previously decided by the independent panel.\u201cAt all times, FINA\u2019s primary concern is the welfare of the aquatics community and ensuring the integrity of our competitions.\u201dLatimer calls the incident between Zhou and Wright at the Olympics a \u201cwatershed moment\u201d for him \u2013 the moment he decided to support the New Zealand federation\u2019s complaint and then subsequently speak publicly about Zhou\u2019s behavior and his concerns for the integrity of the sport.\u201cI\u2019m well aware that through this whistleblower process, I could lose my position on the Technical Committee,\u201d he says.\u201cWe have elections in two months\u2019 time in Budapest [at the World Championships, which start on June 17]. But for me, seeing this complaint through and getting some action is more important than maintaining my position on the committee, although I would obviously like to stay on the committee and be part of the process to ensure this sort of behavior doesn\u2019t continue.\u201dAllegations against Zhou, Latimer says, have been slow to emerge due to her influential status within the sport.The \u201cIron Lady\u201d of Chinese diving, Zhou became the country\u2019s first ever Olympic gold medalist in the sport in 1984.She went on to spearhead China\u2019s dominance in diving, coaching the national team from 1990 to 1997. Today, as well as being a FINA vice president, she is also the chair of the Chinese Swimming Association.\u201cPeople are scared stiff, they\u2019re petrified of rocking the boat and losing their position,\u201d Latimer says.Huffman, meanwhile, says she fears for the future of the sport and the potential difficulty of attracting new judges given Zhou\u2019s alleged behavior.\u201cPeople won\u2019t want to judge. They just won\u2019t,\u201d she adds.\u201cWe\u2019re already struggling to get judges, particularly out of the South America region. All the judges from that area are aging out and the new people coming in, they hear bad things about her, how mean she is, how intimidating she is. Who wants to go experience that?\u201dAs for Wright, she\u2019s looking forward to her next judging commitments with optimism, undaunted by what happened at the Olympics. She is in line to officiate at the World Championships in June and the Commonwealth Games in Birmingham, England, in July.Zhou will likely be at the World Championships, but that doesn\u2019t cause her too much concern.\u201cWhat\u2019s in the past is in the past,\u201d says Wright. \u201cI really do believe that I choose forgiveness, that I choose to just move on and continue doing what I love.\u201dCNN\u2019s Beijing Bureau contributed to reporting."

        "text": "Expectations were low for the Philadelphia 76ers withoutbut, led by James Harden, the Sixers secured a huge 119-115 win against the Boston Celtics in Game 1 of their best-of-seven Eastern Conferenceclash.There have always been question marks surrounding Harden\u2019s performances in the playoffs. Critics have suggested the 10-timedoesn\u2019t produce when it really matters, but in this vital game, Harden delivered with a vintage performance.On the night of the Met Gala, the guard made a stunning fashion statement off the court \u2013 and just had to show up on the hardwood to match his effort off it. Harden did just this and dropped 45 points on 17-of-30 shooting, as well draining seven shots from deep at a rate of 50% in a performance reminiscent of his MVP days with the Houston Rockets.Buoyed by the home crowd support at TD Garden, the Celtics raced off to a strong start. Jaylen Brown scored 14 first-quarter points and Boston took a 38-31 lead after the opening quarter.Sixers fans could have been forgiven for thinking the worst at this point of the game without the NBA\u2019s back-to-back scoring champion, but this Philadelphia team is made of sterner stuff than past iterations.Quarter by quarter, Doc Rivers\u2019 team scraped back the Celtics\u2019 lead and the scores were level at 87-87 heading into the final 12 minutes.Both teams traded buckets in the decisive quarter with neither side allowing their counterpart to gain any significant advantage, but thanks to a pair of Jayson Tatum free throws, the Celtics took a one-point advantage with 26 seconds left on the clock.The Sixers then worked the ball to \u201cThe Beard,\u201d and Harden sought out a mismatch on the Celtics\u2019 Al Horford.The 33-year-old\u2019s teammates fled the scene and allowed Harden to isolate Horford for a 1-on-1 at the top of the key. The iso king patiently worked on the Celtics center before draining a trademark step-back three to give the Sixers the lead in the clutch \u2013 ultimately winning the game for his side in the process.Speaking to reporters post-game, Harden touched on his attitude heading into the match-up.\u201cWe didn\u2019t come into the game expecting to lose. We came in here to win,\u201d Harden explained. \u201cWhether [Embiid] comes back or not, we\u2019re going to be ready to go.\u201dIt wasn\u2019t just Harden who delivered for the Sixers in Embiid\u2019s absence with Tyrese Maxey, Tobias Harris and De\u2019Anthony Melton also stepping up when needed with 26, 18 and 17 points respectively.Speaking after the game, Sixers head coach Rivers spoke on the group effort from his squad.\u201cThat\u2019s the difference between this year\u2019s team and last year\u2019s team. We have a bunch of street fighters,\u201d Rivers said. \u201cIf we could get to the fourth quarter, we were going to win the game. That\u2019s how we felt.\u201dElsewhere, the Denver Nuggets took a 2-0 series lead against the Phoenix Suns to take control of their Western Conference semifinal.In a relatively low-scoring affair, reigning back-to-back MVP Nikola Jokic tallied 39 points, 16 rebounds and five assists as the Nuggets sealed a 97-87 win.The Suns will be concerned with the health of point guard Chris Paul, who had to leave the game early, as they look to mount a comeback on their home court."

You don\u2019t know what to do if Russian troops come to your house,\u201d Stepanenko told.\u201cIt\u2019s very difficult for me, as a man who wanted to support his family. I was scared about my family, I really didn\u2019t know what to do in that specific situation.\u201dStepanenko had been at his family home when he learned about Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine in the early morning of February 24, 2022.That date is seared into Stepanenko\u2019s memory as the day that his life, and the lives of millions across Ukraine, changed forever.Amid all the chaos and confusion, Stepanenko decided that his family would be safer hiding in the basement of their home.They spent three days sheltering, unsure of what their fate would be, before eventually escaping the nation\u2019s capital.The family moved south to get away from the fighting before eventually leaving the country and moving to Moldova, then Romania, before finally settling in Spain.\u201cI really felt relieved when we moved from Kyiv,\u201d Stepanenko said as he spoke to CNN in London ahead of Ukraine\u2019sin March.It\u2019s been over a year since the start of the war, which shows no sign of ending.The devastation has only truly been revealed in the aftermath of Russia\u2019s retreat from areas north of the capital city of Kyiv and parts of southern and eastern Ukraine. The names of towns like Bucha and Irpin have become synonymous with Russian atrocities and alleged war crimes.The fighting still continues, with parts of eastern and southern Ukraine suffering nearly nonstop assaults from Russian forces.Against that backdrop, Stepanenko is grateful to have escaped, courtesy of special conditions granted to him as a father of three children and also as a professional athlete.Ukrainian tennis player Elina Svitolina on a 'mission' to help war-torn countryBut the imposing midfielder, who has played 72 times for his country, doesn\u2019t take that privilege for granted and knows he\u2019s been more fortunate than most.It\u2019s why he\u2019s now dedicated his life and career to raising awareness of Ukraine\u2019s fight \u2013 the softly spoken Stepanenko sees it as his national duty to do so and says he\u2019s spoken to countless journalists from across the world.His determination to speak on behalf of his compatriots and keep Ukraine in the news agenda is also partly driven by a call from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky for the country\u2019s athletes to represent Ukraine on the global stage, urging them toof the issues facing their compatriots back home.\u201cAll people in Ukraine have a duty for the country, guys my age are soldiers and volunteers, they help in hospitals or are teachers,\u201d Stepanenko tells CNN.\u201cI\u2019m a footballer, so what can I do for my country? The best I can do is represent my country as a player [\u2026] and send the message to European countries and tell our story through football,\u201d adds Stepanenko, who speaks so calmly about the devastating topic of war.In addition to representing his country, Stepanenko is proud to play for Shakhtar Donetsk, which is one of Ukraine\u2019s biggest clubs.He joined the club in 2010 and has since played over 200 times, winning eight league titles. But playing for the team means Stepanenko has lived a peripatetic existence.When Russia forcefully annexed Crimea in 2014 and fighting between pro-Russian separatists and the Ukrainian army broke out in eastern Ukraine, Shakhtar was forced out of its home in the Donbas region. The club has been on the move ever since.Without a permanent home, the demand on the club\u2019s squad has been relentless, with travel and logistics taking a heavy toll on players, staff and supporters alike.\u201cI\u2019m more motivated to play football, not just as a footballer, but as someone who has a duty for his country,\u201d he added, when asked how he\u2019s been able to focus on sport.\u201cEvery match I take part in, for Shakhtar or the national team, I always say to the younger guys [\u2026] that it\u2019s our duty to do our best to represent our country.\u201cTo give the message that the Ukrainian people are strong. They are fighting on every field: sports, politics and the battlefield.\u201dWhether playing for their clubs or the national team, it impossible for Ukraine\u2019s players to escape the war.Many start each morning by checking social media, news channels and air-raid apps which tell them about the most recent strikes to hit the country.That\u2019s been the unenviable reality for Ukrainian midfielder Ruslan Malinovskyi for over a year.Their houses were destroyed in the war. Now boxer Oleksandr Usyk is helping Ukrainian families move back homeThe 29-year-old was playing for Italian club Atalanta when he heard about Russia\u2019s invasion and was preparing to play a Europa League match against Greek side Olympiacos that evening.The midfielder spent the day on the phone to friends and family, ensuring his loved ones were safe. Then while struggling to come to terms with the new reality, Malinovskyi says he was asked by the coaching staff whether he could play. His answer was never in doubt.\u201cOf course, I said yes,\u201d Malinovskyi, who is now on loan at French club Marseille, tells CNN Sport.Despite his mind being occupied by the escalating violence back home, Malinovskyi not only played against Olympiacos but scored two goals in the 3-0 win \u2013 his second an astonishing effort from long distance.When celebrating his first goal, Malinovskyi lifted up his jersey to reveal a message on his undershirt which read: \u201cNo War In Ukraine.\u201dIt was a moment that reverberated around the world.\u201cEvery day, I think about how it\u2019s possible in 2022 and 2023 that war is still possible. Some other country trying to take some part of another country,\u201d he says.\u201cI want to say thank you to all the countries who support Ukraine, and we do our best to make peace in the world. That\u2019s how it should be.\u201dMalinovskyi has seen how the game can play a role in providing respite from the war\u2019s devastating reality.\u201cFootball is emotion [\u2026] when you work all week, if somebody has stress, somebody has a difficult week, football is where you can put it out,\u201d he says.\u201cIt can sometimes make you happy, sometimes make you angry, sometimes sad [\u2026] I think that\u2019s why football is the number one sport in the world.\u201dMalinovskyi brushes off concerns that the war has made it harder for him on the pitch and, like many of his national teammates, he\u2019s aware of how fortunate he\u2019s been.Like Stepanenko, he sees playing football as his national duty and a way of repaying those fighting on the frontline.Malinovskyi has also set up a charity alongside his partner which has supplied much needed medical equipment for the children of Ukraine.Both Malinovskyi and Stepanenko will be key members of the Ukrainian national team in its bid to qualify for the European Championships, hosted by Germany, in 2024.The campaign got off to a difficult start after a 2-0 defeat to England at Wembley in March, but the team will look to regroup in time for its next fixtures against North Macedonia and Malta in June.\u201cI\u2019m proud that I\u2019m a Ukrainian and I can represent all players that play in Ukraine,\u201d says Malinovskyi, who has played 52 times for the national team.\u201cFor me, a patriot is someone who loves his country and the people in it. The parliament, the president should work for the people, not for himself.\u201cEvery person wants to make this country better and, of course, make it happy.\u201d"

But Finau wasn\u2019t retracing the steps of his victory at Vidanta Vallarta \u2013 he was at the nearby Lakes Course, caddying for two of his sons during some night-time par three action.Under the lights, the champion lugged a pair of bags as the two youngsters scampered ahead, as seen in footageto Twitter by the PGA Tour.Four hours after the win ...caddied for his kids at a local par-3 course \ud83e\udd79The pictures will have come as no surprise to anyone who watched,\u201d wherein Finau charmed viewers in his starring role as a devoted family man traveling the world with his wife Alayna and five children.The docuseries saw the 33-year-old revisit his childhood home in Salt Lake City and humble beginnings before he made it as a pro golfer. On Sunday, his sixth PGA Tour victory fell on El D\u00eda Del Ni\u00f1o \u2013 Children\u2019s Day in Mexico \u2013 and Finau had a message for youngsters.\u201cKeep working hard and keep believing in yourself, there\u2019s nothing that you aren\u2019t able to achieve with hard work and some faith in what you\u2019re doing,\u201d Finau told reporters.Imposter syndrome, confidence crises and meltdowns: Netflix's \"Full Swing\" lays bare the psychological stresses of pro golf\u201cThat\u2019s coming from someone I would say that\u2019s very similar to the upbringing of a lot of kids in Mexico. You don\u2019t have to have the resources, but if you have a desire and you work really hard, you never know what you can accomplish and what you can become. Hopefully, I\u2019ve inspired some of these kids as they\u2019ve been out here watching me and inspire them to do some great things.\u201cI\u2019m not really anybody special. When I was a kid, I was just like them, I didn\u2019t come from very much, but I put a lot of sacrifice and hard work into becoming a great golfer. If you do that, then you can do some great things.\u201d\u201cFull Swing\u201d posed the question of whether Finau could balance his family commitments with his pursuit of silverware. The American has answered that query emphatically.Having finished joint runner-up to Rahm at last year\u2019s Mexico Open, Finau derailed the Spaniard\u2019s title defense to clinch his fourth win in his last 18 starts and jump five places to world No. 11.While a major title remains elusive, triumph over the newly-crowned Masters champion and the game\u2019s most in-form player is a morale boost ahead of the PGA Championship later this month.\u201cAny time you can battle with a guy like Jon Rahm who\u2019s in the form that he was and come out on top, it makes me feel good,\u201d Finau said.\u201cRahm is a good friend of mine, we practice quite a bit together so having \u2018Rahmbo\u2019 as like a sparring partner for me has only made me better and I hope he can say the same.Jon Rahm sets new PGA Tour earnings record with four months still to play\u201cAs far as my future, you never know what your future holds, but take it a day at a time and this is a nice step in the right direction on my season. We\u2019ll just continue to stack up hopefully some wins and some major championships in the future.\u201d"

        "text": "Whenturned around and looked back at the tower of frothing water above him, he could scarcely believe what he had just experienced.The American has taken his trademark pink kayak to some of the most remote waterfalls in the world, but few, he says, compared to the Santo Domingo Gorge in Mexico \u2013 home to theBuried deep in a jungle in the southern state of Chiapas, the four tightly-packed waterfalls are well secluded from civilization, as hazardous as they are paradise for kayakers like Jackson.\u201cIt\u2019s one of those sections that you just cannot believe even exists,\u201d he tells, several weeks after descending the whitewater section in March.The run drops more than 300 feet in the space of 0.2 miles and is broken up into four sections: Angel Wings, The Dome, Toboggan, and Raw Dog.The first two are the tallest and therefore the most challenging; Angel Wings drops about 80 feet and runs almost directly into The Dome, which is 85 feet.\u201cThey\u2019re very uniquely-shaped,\u201d says Jackson, \u201cparticularly those first two waterfalls \u2013 they\u2019re very close together, which means from that first big, more challenging waterfall to the next, there\u2019s almost no time.\u201cYou have to really make sure you\u2019re on line, which is why we really prioritized getting as much safety around that particular waterfall.\u201dAs part of those safety precautions, Jackson and his team checked the water levels and studied the surrounding area, then fitted ropes on either side of the river to help with any extraction if anything went awry.The whole section is high-risk, especially as the nearest hospital is nearly two hours away by car. With one waterfall running straight into another, even a small mistake at the top of the descent can create problems later on.Jackson and his friend Bren Orton became only the fourth and fifth people to ever complete the entire sequence, according to Jackson\u2019s representative, due to the potentially dangerous nature of having such big waterfalls so close together.Rush Struges, Rafa Ortiz, and Evan Garcia were the first people to run the waterfalls from top to bottom in 2013.\u201cIt is a very remote spot,\u201d says Jackson, \u201cso you really have to make sure you trust your decision to run it and also the people there to help you.\u201dThe 29-year-old Jackson is as comfortable kayaking down an isolated gorge as he is competing internationally, having won four freestyle world championship titles since 2013.Three years ago, he descended the 134-foot Salto del Maule waterfall in Chile, the second-highest waterfall descent in history and an experience he likened to \u201cfalling off the face of the earth.\u201dJackson\u2019s achievements in the sport are perhaps not wholly surprising give his family background. His father, Eric, was an Olympic kayaker and freestyle world champion, while his sister, Emily, has also won world titles.But that doesn\u2019t stop Jackson\u2019s family getting anxious when he embarks on a big project, including his descent in the Santo Domingo Gorge.\u201cMy dad\u2019s a pro kayaker, my sister\u2019s a pro kayaker, my mom has been there every step of the way,\u201d says Jackson. \u201cI think especially my mom and my sister in particular, they don\u2019t love when I do the big stuff like this.\u201cI usually just let them know after the fact what\u2019s happened, what I\u2019m doing \u2026 They\u2019re always stoked to hear when it goes well.\u201dAmid the dangers presented by Jackson\u2019s latest challenge in the Santo Domingo Gorge was also a reminder of why he fell in love with kayaking in the first place.\u201cTo do it well and safely and be at the bottom with your friends?\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing like it.\u201d"

        "text": "There\u2019s a lot you can do in just under three minutes.You can listen to \u201cSpeed of Life\u201d by David Bowie, you can re-live Usain Bolt\u2019s 100m world record run 18 times, and, if you are an exceptionally talented Premier League footballer, you can evenAlternatively, you can watch ahit a single ball.That was the situation one fan found himself in at thelast month, as he fired up the stopwatch on his iPhone to time Patrick Cantlay lining up a shot during the final round of the PGA Tour event.This is getting out of control\u23f0When the American eventually swung, the clock was ticking past two minutes and 50 seconds.In Cantlay\u2019s defense, the video wasn\u2019t without caveats. It was an awkward looking lie, the ball lodged in the rough behind a tree, and \u2013 with the timer at 90 seconds when first shown \u2013 it is impossible to know exactly how long the world No. 4 spent over his shot.The problem for Cantlay, however, is that it was not an isolated incident \u2013 nor the most disgruntled reaction.Footage of the golfer spending close to a minute standing over a four-foot putt that same day quickly found its way to the satirical side of the sport\u2019s Twitter community, which spliced the pictures with the closing scenes of the golf comedy classic \u201cHappy Gilmore.\u201dThe titular character calculated and sunk his winning championship putt \u2013 one that bounced off the windshield of a car and careened leisurely around the debris of a collapsed tower \u2013 before Cantlay holed his effort, afrom parody account Tour Golf showed.A week prior during the deciding round of The Masters, Cantlay had been playing ahead of the leading group, Brooks Koepka andKoepka, whose frustrations with slow playwith rival Bryson DeChambeau in 2019, made no secret of his grievances.\u201cThe group in front of us were brutally slow,\u201d Koepka told reporters.\u201cJon went to the bathroom like seven times during the round, and we were still waiting.\u201dYet Koepka\u2019s comments paled in comparison to those made by one of Cantlay\u2019s playing partners during that decisive round at the RBC Heritage, Matt Fitzpatrick. The Englishman, seeing off Jordan Spieth in a playoff, but did not leave Hilton Head fully satisfied.For Fitzpatrick, regarded as one of the fastest players on the tour, a three-ball round should never take longer than four and a half hours. To get near that is a \u201cdisgrace,\u201d to go well past it is \u201ctruly appalling.\u201d\u201cThe problem is this conversation has gone on for years and years and years, and no one has ever done anything, so I feel it\u2019s almost a waste of time talking about it,\u201d Fitzpatrick told Sky Sports.\u201cI have strong opinions, but no one\u2019s going to do anything about it. It\u2019s like hitting your head against a brick wall. No one ever gets penalized.\u201cI think it\u2019s a real issue, way more needs to be done. The thing is I really like referees over here, they are great people, but I did not see a single ref all day. There were a few shots we were waiting and I don\u2019t understand where they are all hiding. It does become frustrating when you are waiting so long.\u201dFurther complaints came from beyond the confines of the PGA Tour.Responding to the video of the fan timing Cantlay on, former LPGA pro Anya Alvarez labeled it \u201catrocious.\u201d\u201cWhat is the point of having a pace of play rule if you\u2019re going to allow this? I was penalized on LPGA for slow play \u2026 and it forced me to speed up,\u201d Alvarez said.And even the game\u2019s greatest are weighing in, with Jack Nicklaus and Annika S\u00f6renstam both admitting that the PGA Tour have a problem on their hands.\u201cIt\u2019s got to be equitable, but they need to make an example and stay with it,\u201d Nicklaus toldahead of the PGA Tour of Champions\u2019 Greats of Golf event on Saturday.\u201cIt\u2019s not very pleasant to watch somebody stand over the ball for half an hour.\u201dS\u00f6renstam added: \u201cNobody enjoys it and it\u2019s not fair, we\u2019re running out of time. Time is a precious commodity, so I think start at the very beginning and teach them to hit when you\u2019re ready and go.\u201cThe more we think, the more complicated it gets, so just hit and go.\u201dFor Golf Digest analysts Joel Beall, Alex Myers and Luke Kerr-Dineen, there was a general consensus for Fitzpatrick\u2019s outburst: blunt, but true.As well as having a negative \u201cripple effect\u201d on groups behind the slow player \u2013 akin to the chain reaction of braking causing traffic jams on a highway \u2013 it could also lead to the Tour losing valuable eyes.\u201cPace of play is an issue and has been for years,\u201d Beall told.\u201cWhat\u2019s changed is that sports leagues are recognizing their consumers don\u2019t have an infinite amount of time to devote to their fandoms and are adjusting accordingly. That golf hasn\u2019t has amplified the existing problem.\u201dHowever, Cantlay seems unfazed. After dropping in a sensational hole-in-one during the second round of the RBC Heritage, the Americanvideo of his effort with the caption: \u201cPlaying faster!\u201dQuizzed on Fitzpatrick\u2019s criticisms ahead of the following week\u2019s Zurich Classic, Cantlay said his tenure on the PGA Tour\u2019s Player Advisory Council (PAC) had shown him that round times had been relatively similar across the last decade.\u201cSo trying to speed it up, I\u2019d be curious to know how they\u2019d want to do that,\u201d Cantlay told reporters.\u201cI played the last two tournaments, and my group hasn\u2019t been warned at all \u2026 I don\u2019t know how you would want the groups that I\u2019ve been in to play faster when our groups are in position and can\u2019t go faster because the group in front of us is right in front of us.\u201cI\u2019m definitely slower than average, have been my whole career. I definitely take my time \u2026 I haven\u2019t had anybody come up to me or talk to me, but I\u2019d be perfectly happy to talk to them about it.\u201dCantlay was speaking alongside fellow American Xander Schauffele, who defended his compatriot.\u201cAll the things that have happened as of late have all been within the guidelines of the Tour and what\u2019s supposed to happen,\u201d Schauffele said.\u201cNo one\u2019s been penalized for slow play or anything of that nature, so we\u2019re all operating within the framework of what the Tour gives us. If enough people complain or if enough Tour pros complain, that\u2019s something the Tour needs to address to either make it faster or change the time par.\u201cWe\u2019re not playing like the local muni [municipal course] that the average Joe compares our time par to \u2013 we\u2019re playing for a couple million. If you\u2019re going to spend an extra minute to make sure you put yourself in the right spot, we\u2019re going to do it.\u201dIronically, the PGA Tour\u2019s Tournament Regulationsspends a lot of time on pace of play guidelines.An entire chapter dedicated to the issue begins by citing the R&A and USGA\u2019s Rules of Golf guidance that \u201ca round of golf is meant to be played at a prompt pace.\u201d That pace is set at 40 seconds to play a stroke, with an extra 10 seconds afforded under various circumstances, such as the first player to play a shot on a par-3 hole or on the green respectively.\u201cThe player should usually be able to play more quickly than that and is encouraged to do so,\u201d the guidelines state, with golfers that exceed 40 seconds \u2013 AKA \u201cbad time\u201d \u2013 \u201cinformed as soon as practicable\u201d by a tournament official.While the first \u201cbad time\u201d offense goes unpunished, one- and two-stroke penalties are awarded for second and third violations respectively. A fourth offense during a round warrants disqualification. A second \u201cbad time\u201d equals a fine of $50,000, with a $20,000 fine for each subsequent offense.Players that average more than 45 seconds a stroke over a 10-tournament rolling period are notified that they have been put on The Observation List, putting them under direct scrutiny from the Rules Committee. Observed golfers must play each stroke in under 60 seconds.Should a player spend more than two minutes on a shot without a valid excuse, they are hit with an Excessive Shot Time. While the first offense goes unpunished, subsequent breaks put the golfer on The Observation List and are penalized by a monetary fine, starting at $10,000.Both The Observation List and Excessive Shot Time were introduced by the PGA Tour in April 2020 to help speed up the pace of the game.\u201cYou talk to players, read articles, hear from fans and what gets people, what gnaws at them, are these individual habits that people have,\u201d then-PGA Tour chief of operations Tyler DennisSky Sports.\u201cIt\u2019s seen as bad etiquette. It\u2019s seen as a distraction, and we\u2019re targeting those individual moments to help their fellow competitors and assist our media partners with presentation.\u201cWe want to keep the focus where it should be: on world-class shot-making.\u201dSo how do you solve a problem like slow play?One idea,by PGA Tour golfer Michael Kim, is to name and shame via a monthly report of the slowest players.Y\u2019all think Cantlay is slow\u2026 you should see some others\u2026 \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2642\ufe0f I think there should be a monthly report of the slowest players on. Public shaming won\u2019t work on Cantlay but might work on others.This was a strategy tested by 2010 Ryder Cup winner Edoardo Molinari in 2019, as the Italian \u2013 having voiced his frustration with the pace of play on the European Tour \u2013 fulfilled his promise of sharing a spreadsheet documenting the slowest golfers on the Tour via.Arguably the most commonly suggested solution, however, is the adoption of a shot clock, akin to those used in both the NBA and Major League Baseball ().How the MLB pitch clock became a batter's problemThe European Tour trialed the move at The Shot Clock Masters in 2018, dishing out red cards and one-shot penalties for violations, with players afforded two \u201ctime-outs\u201d during each round.However, Kerr-Dineen believes a golfing shot clock would be \u201ctoo messy\u201d to enforce. Instead, he says the PGA Tour should take inspiration from the American Junior Golf Association, where the introduction of \u201ctime par\u201d checkpoints every three holes has helped speed up the youngsters\u2019 game.\u201cEach group has to reach the next checkpoint in a specified amount of time. A slow group gets two warnings, then players get a one-stroke penalty for each bad time after that,\u201d Kerr-Dineen explained.\u201cIt\u2019s a simple to understand, proven system \u2013 and it works.\u201dGolf Digest\u2019s Beall sees some value in shot clocks and public calling outs, but squares responsibility with those that decide where to position the hole.\u201cThose in charge of setting up the course on a weekly basis continue to put pin locations in tough spots on greens that are faster than they\u2019ve ever been,\u201d Beall said.\u201cPut the pins in less severe spots and slow the greens down just a touch could go a ways in alleviating the issue.\u201dAnd for Myers, the answer has been staring the PGA Tour in the face all this time: simply enforce the existing rules.It has been 28 years since the last slow play penalty was issued to an individual at a PGA Tour regular event, when Glen Daly received a one-stroke penalty at the 1995 Honda Classic.\u201cWe hear all the time about so-and-so being put on the clock. What\u2019s the point of doing that if you\u2019re not going to take the next step?\u201d Myers asked.\u201cStart adding strokes to players\u2019 scores and you\u2019ll quickly see those guys taking time off their pre-shot routines.\u201dTony Finau caddies for young sons, just hours after Mexico Open winSuch a change would be music to the ears of Koepka, who in 2019 was so frustrated that he offered himself up to play the role of martyr.\u201cI\u2019ve tried to get put on the clock, but it doesn\u2019t seem to work because nobody will penalize anybody. Even if I take over 40 seconds, penalize me,\u201d Koepka said.\u201cI\u2019ll be the guinea pig, it doesn\u2019t matter. It needs to happen.\u201d"

        "text": "Arthur Webber made history this year. On the rainy evening of March 31, 2023, he captained what he says is the first ever all trans masculine soccer team in Europe in a match. Players stepped out onto the pitch in blue and pink patterned kits \u2013 the same colors that adorn the trans pride flag.Trans masculine is a term used for people that were assigned female at birth and whose gender identity or expression (or both) is masculine. The umbrella definition includes trans men, non-binary and gender-fluid people.The game was played in front of 500 supporters, fittingly, onand for the 25-year-old Webber \u2013 as someone who gave up football at the age of 13 and only started playing again in 2022 \u2013 it was a night he couldn\u2019t have dreamt of as a teenager.\u201cI was quite nervous before the match,\u201d Webber told CNN. \u201cI\u2019ve never been captain before, so it was a responsibility I wasn\u2019t used to. I also knew it was likely that the eyes of transphobes online would be on us when we walked out.\u201cI wanted to make sure we got a decent result and that the guys playing had fun \u2013 especially because lots of them hadn\u2019t played football since school. I had to explain the offside rule to a few of them in the changing rooms!\u201dWebber himself didn\u2019t play soccer for 11 years. When he came out as trans as a teenager, he gave the sport up \u2013 although he never stopped loving the game.\u201cOnce we walked onto the pitch, there was a real sense of pride that we were there and we were doing something special.\u201dThe team that played that historic match are part of a club called\u2013 which was formed in January 2021 with the initial goal of raising money for their namesake, Trans Radio UK. They now also aim to make soccer a more inclusive sport and connect the trans community.After a regulation change for transgender athletes, CeC\u00e9 Telfer is determined to 'keep pursuing her dreams'The manager is\u2013 who thesays became English soccer\u2019s first trans referee in 2018 \u2013 and organized the first ever all trans feminine team in the world, also for TRUK, in 2022.Clark, as manager, has overseen the history-making feats of TRUK United and Webber says it was her that encouraged him to captain the all trans masculine team last month.is an umbrella term that refers to people that were assigned male at birth but identify with femininity.includes trans women, non-binary and gender-fluid people.\u201cAfter the all trans feminine team played their game and once I\u2019d played with the all-gender team, she took me aside and said she\u2019d been thinking about what we could do next and asked if I\u2019d be interested in captaining an all trans masc team,\u201d Webber said.\u201cI thought it was a great idea because in the all-gender team, I was the only trans masc player in that side and there was a need for greater representation for trans men.\u201dWebber put out a call on social media, namely on Twitter, for trans men who want to play soccer and was delighted by the response.Soon, a full 11-a-side team had assembled and it even included a British TV star \u2013 Ash Palmisciano plays the first trans character in the long-running soap opera \u201cEmmerdale\u201d and even drove down from Leeds to London just to play the match.The match and the positive reception to it has given Webber hope for the future of trans representation in soccer \u2013 at grassroots levels and beyond. Right now though, Webber doesn\u2019t think the sport is doing enough.At the moment, Webber says, soccer is not trans inclusive. \u201cEven in amateur LGBTQ leagues, the teams are mostly made up of cisgender gay men \u2013 there is a lack of trans people. I can count on one hand the number of trans people I know that play in LGBTQ clubs,\u201d he said.Webber says consideration for trans people can often be an afterthought in soccer.\u201cFor example, sometimes clubs will book venues where there are only two changing rooms \u2013 one for each team that\u2019s playing but if you have people of multiple genders on one team, [such as on mixed gender soccer teams] they might not want to get changed in the same room as everyone else in the squad,\u201d explained Webber.He feels that grassroots soccer, including LGBTQ clubs, still has a lot to learn, and so do the top clubs \u2013 such as those in the Premier League.Cycling governing body defends transgender policy after Austin Killips wins Tour of the GilaWhen Webber stopped playing soccer after coming out as trans, he also stopped following the sport \u2013 which meant, for many years, he did not keep up with his beloved Arsenal. He said it simply \u201churt too much\u201d to watch soccer while he felt like he couldn\u2019t play.Now, he is involved with the North London club\u2019s LGBTQ fan group \u2013 Gay Gooners \u2013 and attends games at the Emirates stadium. But he stresses that there is still more to be done by top clubs for their trans supporters:\u201cThey are trying. I\u2019ve done a lot of work with Arsenal over the years and the big clubs have come some way in including their trans fans,\u201d Webber said to CNN.\u201cBut what we really need is trans people in the rooms where decisions are made. There has to be someone there that\u2019s actually affected by these issues to tell you what\u2019s needed.\u201dreads: \u201cOver the years, Arsenal in the Community has taken an active role in providing LGBTQ+ education and tackling homophobia. Our community team are trained by Stonewall to deliver LGBTQ+ awareness sessions to staff and community groups.\u201dThe historic all trans masc match that took place on March 31st came at a particularly difficult time for trans athletes.World Athletics recently banned some trans women from competing in female track and field events, pending a new review of their rules. In June 2022, the global governing body forransgender women from playing in women\u2019s international matches.In the same month, the International Swimming Federation (FINA) voted to approve a new policy thatfrom competing in elite women\u2019s aquatics competitions.In April 2022,from competition.Many trans people feel excluded from sport at the moment.In asaid she felt \u201cdevastation\u201d for herself and \u201cfor many around the world\u201d when World Athletics made its announcement in March. But Telfer made clear that she wouldn\u2019t be deterred from running.\u201cThere\u2019s a place for each and every one of us and I know where I belong,\u201d Telfer told CNN\u2019s Amanda Davies. \u201cI just want the world to know that.\u201dAnd as things are getting tougher for trans athletes around the world, daily life, too, is getting harder for trans people \u2013 especially in the UK.Will swimming's transgender ruling lead to wider change in sports?In January,passed by the devolved Scottish Parliament and intended to allow trans people in Scotland to change their legal gender without a medical diagnosis.The then First Minister of Scotland, Nicola Sturgeon, subsequently called the intervention \u201ca full-frontal attack on our democratically elected Scottish Parliament and its ability to make its own decisions on devolved matters,\u201d in a post on Twitter.During the race for the Conservative Party leadership,in a Twitter post, and attached a link to an article in which an unnamed Sunak ally was quoted as saying the lawmaker was \u201ccritical of recent trends to erase women via the use of clumsy, gender-neutral language,\u201d in reference to language that is meant to be inclusive of trans and non-binary people in addition to cisgender women.Just weeks ago,on whether teachers should inform parents when a child questions their own gender identity.In April,andreported that Equalities Minister Kemi Badenoch is considering amending the 2010 UK Equality Act to redefine \u201csex\u201d to refer specifically to a person\u2019s sex assigned at birth \u2013 a move that would make it legal to ban transgender people from \u201csingle-sex\u201d spaces that match a trans person\u2019s gender identity.Inthe Equalities and Human Rights Commissionsaid the UK government should \u201cconsider the potential implications of this change\u201d and recommended detailed policy and legal analysis be undertaken \u201cin compliance with the Public Sector Equality Duty and with due regard to any possible disadvantages for trans men and trans women.\u201dWhen it comes to trans representation in English soccer, Webber hopes that thewon\u2019t follow suit with other sport governing bodies and ban trans people from competing: \u201cI hope the FA won\u2019t cave to pressure from internet trolls and transphobes. I just hope they do what\u2019s right.\u201dIn a statement, the FA told CNN: \u201cOur transgender policy has enabled many positive outcomes for people who wish to enjoy and play football either in their affirmed gender or in a safe and inclusive environment.\u201cThis important subject is complex and is constantly evolving, and as a result, like many other national governing bodies in sport, we are currently reviewing our transgender policy for English football.\u201dWhat Webber hopes the future of soccer holds is a space for visible trans players. Whether that\u2019s in the National League, League One, the Championship or even the Premier League.\u201cI hope that young trans people playing football right now know there\u2019s a place for them in the sport and, so, they won\u2019t give it up,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd maybe in the next generation, there will be a trans player at the top level. Maybe, in ten years or so, we\u2019ll get there and that would be just amazing to see.\u201dWorld Athletics regulations on transgender women athletes risk human rights violations, rights groups sayWebber thinks his young self would have barely been able to believe the achievement TRUK made just last month: \u201cTo play in an all trans masc team, in a match against a team of cisgender people, that just wouldn\u2019t have been conceivable to me at 13.\u201d\u201cI am becoming the visibility I didn\u2019t have when I was a kid.\u201dWebber knows it is going to take time for soccer to be completely trans inclusive and expressed his admiration for TRUK manager Lucy Clark for being a visible driving force in trans representation in the game.\u201cShe puts her head above the parapet time and time again,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that is incredibly brave. It really sucks that, in order to push for greater trans inclusivity in sport, someone has to make themselves visible to everyone and know that they might face abuse because of that. But she is willing to take that risk just to ensure trans people are being considered in football.\u201dWebber, above all, is determined to ensure that no one feels excluded from soccer: \u201cI want trans people who\u2019ve never played football to know that this is a sport for them.\u201d\u201cThis is just the start,\u201d he said. \u201cOne day, there\u2019ll be hundreds of trans people playing football all over the country at all levels.\u201d"

        "text": "To, the final few seconds felt like they would never end, pain overwhelming his body as he lurched towards the finish line.But when he did break the tape, gratefully falling into the arms of bystanders shortly after, the famed middle-distance runner knew immediately what he had achieved.As Bannister gasped for breath, the announcer tasked with declaring the finishing time got as a far as \u201cthree \u2026\u201d before the noise of the crowd drowned out the rest, for the exact time now seemed irrelevant.It was 69 years ago on Saturday that Bannister became the first man ever to run a mile inside four minutes, gaining sporting immortality in three minutes, 59.4 seconds at Iffley Road track in Oxford, England.The achievement, thought by some at the time to be impossible, had been dubbed running\u2019s Everest in the years leading up to that day in 1954, though it didn\u2019t take long for the record to be lowered even more.Australian John Landy, one of Bannister\u2019s rivals also gunning to break the four-minute barrier, took more than a second off the Briton\u2019s time in Turku, Finland, a few weeks later.But it\u2019s Bannister\u2019s landmark record that remains history\u2019s most famous mile effort. In the years that followed, male athletes treated their first sub-four-minute mile as a watershed moment \u2013 a rite of passage on the way to becoming a top middle-distance runner.\u201cI was on cloud nine for two weeks \u2026 I remember I\u2019d be sitting in the car driving and I\u2019d get this big smile just thinking about that sub-four-minute mile,\u201d former American track runner, who first dipped under four minutes in 1970, toldlast year.\u201cIt was just something that takes you right to the core of how important it was.\u201dWottle was the 39th American man to break four minutes in the mile, an achievement he ranks on par with equaling the 800-meter world record and winning Olympic gold.\u201cBack then, getting under that four-minute mile was a big thing, especially for milers,\u201d he added.The four-minute mile captured the imagination of the general public partly because it was easily quantifiable \u2013 four laps of a running track, each lap run in under a minute \u2013 but also because of the appetite for discovery at the time of Bannister\u2019s record.Edmund Hilary and Sherpa Tenzing Norgay had becomethe year before, and the first four-minute mile duly became running\u2019s own Everest summit, expanding perceptions of human potential.As well as Bannister and Landy, American Wes Santee was also bidding to break four minutes at the same time, though he fell short of the mark on several occasions throughout his career.\u201cThis kind of combination of factors I think came together and made it this mythical undertaking,\u201d author and performance coach Steve Magness tells CNN Sport. \u201cIt became this almost Western, country battle to see who could get there first.\u201dToday, the four-minute mile is still recognized as a notable achievement for male runners, though the frequency with which athletes break the barrier has become a topic of contention.Earlier this year,magazine announced it would no longer update its list of Americans to break four minutes in the mile, explaining in a statement how advances in shoe technology \u201cbombarded the 4:00 barrier into something no longer relevant for tracking.\u201dHowever, the publication reversed the decision after criticism from readers, who still deemed the four-minute mile an accomplishment worth recognizing.It was common for fewer than 10 new runners to enter the Track and Field News annals each year in the 1970s, 80s, and 90s, but today the record books tell a different story.According to\u2019 records, 63 American men have run a sub-four-minute mile for the first time this year \u2013 and that number is likely to rise in the coming months \u2013 while 64 did last year.\u201cIt still has some mystique,\u201d Magness says about the status of the four-minute mile today. \u201cI think where it differs is it\u2019s not that insurmountable mystique \u2013 especially after the last couple of years when we\u2019ve seen a rapid uptick in performance and the number of athletes who have gone under four.\u201dFor long-time track and field coach Peter Thompson, recent developments in shoe technology have been central to increasingly fast times over the mile \u2013 especially since middle-distance running spikes with carbon fiber plates in the soles became widely available in 2021.\u201cFour minutes was the Everest,\u201d Thompson tells CNN Sport, \u201cand somebody said to me recently it\u2019s like they\u2019ve put a chairlift up Everest now.\u201dThompson has previously worked with running brand Hoka to develop carbon-fiber-plated shoes and delivered a workshop on the performance-enhancing effect ofand \u201csuper spikes\u201d \u2013 as they are now ubiquitously known \u2013 at the World Athletics Championships in Eugene, Oregon, last year.Unbeaten in 13 races, Athing Mu is the future of athletics in AmericaThe carbon plates, Thompson says, function as \u201cspring-like devices\u201d and give runners more energy return compared to traditional shoe models.According to data he collated, between 30 and 38 athletes competing in NCAA Division I indoor track races ran sub-four-minute miles each year between 2015 and 2021; that figure has increased about three-fold over the past two years to 90 in 2022 and 97 in 2023, he says.Thompson believes current performances are skewed by modern shoe technology and prefers to focus on the competitive aspect of races, rather than the time.\u201cAthletics is a simple sport,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s about who can jump the highest, who can run the fastest over whatever distance, who can throw the furthest. And the technology behind it doesn\u2019t really matter.\u201dSieg Lindstrom, the editor of Track and Field News, said the outlet stopped updating its list of four-minute-mile debutantes in January but relented a few weeks later after \u201ca raft of negative commentary on social media.\u201d\u201cGive the audience what they want,\u201d Lindstrom tells CNN Sport.He adds, though, that modern shoe technology has \u201cchanged the game\u201d \u2013 thanks to the spikes mile runners wear in races, as well as the road shoes they wear for training.\u201cWorkout performances are faster and recovery is quicker, allowing athletes to pack in more hard training with less risk of injury or overtraining,\u201d says Lindstrom.\u201cFrom coaches and other long-time observers, I\u2019m hearing estimates of four to five seconds of aid over a mile \u2026 I also believe some athletes are \u2018super adapters\u2019 to the shoes and due to stride mechanics get more help from the shoes than do others.\u201dAcknowledging that shoes are \u201ca huge factor\u201d in the assault on the four-minute barrier, Lindstrom also points to modern indoor tracks, many of which are engineered specifically to stage big races and produce fast times.Take, for example, New Balance\u2019s recently-opened indoor track facility in Boston, which has banked lanes to encourage fast running.and The Armoury in New York City, popular hunting grounds for four-minute-mile hopefuls, also lay claim to being some of the fastest tracks in the world.Tom Jordan, who spent 37 years as the race director of the Prefontaine Classic track meet in Eugene, says track surfaces make an \u201cincremental\u201d difference to running times compared with modern shoe technology, which he sees as \u201calmost entirely responsible for the huge improvement in times.\u201d\u201cI think that what you have is a situation where the value of the sub-four-minute mile will be so diminished,\u201d Jordan tells CNN Sport. \u201cIt\u2019ll take 10 years, but it won\u2019t rate a mention in meet summaries or meet stories.\u201dToday, judging by the online response to Track and Field News\u2019 decision to no longer chronicle four-minute miles, the marker is still worth recognizing for many observers.That\u2019s perhaps testament to the mile\u2019s enduring legacy \u2013 even if a sub-four-minute time is unlikely ever to be met with the same fanfare as when Bannister collapsed across the finish line in Oxford nearly 70 years ago. It\u2019s also a sign of the way athletic disciplines develop \u2013 just as the introduction of fiberglass or carbon fiber poles enabled pole vaulters to jump greater heights.\u201cEverything moves on,\u201d1,500-meter world champion Jake Wightman toldin a 2021 interview. \u201cIf you\u2019re arguing we shouldn\u2019t wear these spikes, are you arguing we should never have changed from leather spikes with nails in the bottom running on cinder tracks?\u201d\u201cThere are always going to be developments in technology across the sport \u2026 It\u2019s always going to keep moving forward.\u201dAccording to Jordan, the Prefontaine Classic had more sub-four-minute miles than any other track meet in the world \u2013 something he looks back on with pride. However, he predicts it won\u2019t be too long before we revise what\u2019s considered a \u201cfast\u201d time in the distance.\u201cWhat may well happen is that it will become so common that eventually the athletics public will catch up and say, \u2018Okay, well, four minutes doesn\u2019t really mean that much, but 3:50 is still a very good goal,\u2019\u201d says Jordan.\u201cThere may be new benchmarks that are established in terms of what constitutes the supreme challenge.\u201d"

        "text": "On April 29, 1990, \u2018Nothing Compares 2 U\u2019 by Sinead O\u2019Connor topped the charts in the US, the Detroit Pistons had just begun their road to a second successive NBA title and cranes began pulling down the Berlin Wall at the Brandenburg Gate.In Naples, Marco Baroni was leaping into the Italian spring air to head a ball past a diving goalkeeper to putoneahead against Lazio.One seemingly small event sent a fandom and a city crazy with joy.The defender\u2019s powerful header was the decisive goal in a 1-0 victory and those three points assured Napoli\u2019s position atop Serie A, two points ahead of AC Milan who also won that day.In doing so, Baroni clinched the club\u2019s second ever Italian league title, cementing its golden era into Napoli folklore \u2013 an era spearheaded by the great Diego Maradona.The joy of those two Scudetto title successes didn\u2019t last that long though: Napoli suffered relegations, financial difficulties, near misses and the coming and going of superstars \u2013 all without reclaiming that elusive third title.That was until this year. Led by the towering Nigerian Victor Osimhen, the enigmatic Georgian Khvicha Kvaratskhelia and coach Luciano Spalletti,has romped to the Serie A title, ending 33 years in the wilderness. A fandom and a city, again, rejoice.\u201cThe city is special. For example, it\u2019s very difficult for others to understand what we do for our club,\u201d Daniele \u2018Decibel\u2019 Bellini, Napoli\u2019s stadium announcer, told CNN Sport.In recent years, Bellini has gone viral for his videos announcing Napoli\u2019s goalscorers during games. His \u2018call and response\u2019 style with the fans leaves viewers with goosebumps, such is the enthusiasm displayed from both parties.One YouTube video of Bellini calling out the name of former Napoli striker Gonzalo Higua\u00edn has been viewed over six million times. In the video, Bellini calls out the Argentine\u2019s first name nine times, with the Napoli faithful roaring back the player\u2019s surname in response.\u201cEvery time, I tell them the club is like a girlfriend, is like a mother, is something special for us. And this is the reason for all this passionate, all this incredible love for the team and maybe this is the reason when I go to the stadium and I do my job, the people wait for me for pictures and signatures and videos.\u201dBut, after years of heartache, the title victory is important for so much more than just on field success; it is a victory for southern Italy against its northern rivals, not least because there has long been economic tension between those two parts of the country.\u201cIt will be not just the first time Napoli has won the title since Maradona, but the first time the true south has won, if you\u2019re not counting Rome\u201d Kirsten Schlewitz \u2013 Napoli fan and author of the upcoming book \u2018More Than Maradona: The Birth, Death and Rebirth of SSC Napoli\u2019 \u2013 told CNN.\u201cIt is a big deal for the city as a whole to have that pride and to be able to say: \u2018Look, we can do it too. You don\u2019t need to be the rich northerners. We assembled a smart squad.\u2019\u201cIt\u2019s not a club where teams can just come in and pick off their players and there\u2019s an incredible pride in Napoli developing, Napoli finding the good players, not so much for the youth squad, but being able to be that smart team that can build a competitive squad without \u2026  spending big money on players who are over the hill.\u201cSo there\u2019s that pride in being able to say: \u2018Yeah, but yeah the south did this and the south did this in a different way.\u2019\u201dFootball is in Naples\u2019 DNA.Whether it is the fanatical supporters crammed into the Diego Armando Maradona Stadium on matchdays or the hordes of fans who race through the streets after a Napoli victory, not much gets done on the day of a home game.Bellini says the vice-like grip that the club has on the city is down to Naples only playing host to one major team, Napoli \u2013 a phenomenon unlike most other Serie A cities.\u201cMilan has two, Turin have two, Rome have two and Genoa also have two,\u201d he explains. \u201cNaples is the only big, big, big city in Italy where we have just one club. And this is very important for us and all the people here support Naples.\u201dAs a result, every home game is like a festival of football, with fans reveling in the displays of brilliance their favorite Napoli players \u2013 dressed in the sky-blue shirts and white shorts \u2013 produce.Over the years, they\u2019ve had their fair share of awe-inspiring players who have dazzled and astonished \u2013 most notably, the diminutive genius, Maradona.The Argentine arrived in the south of Italy in 1984, joining from Barcelona for a then world-record fee of $10.5 million.With Maradona\u2019s arrival came a level of success Napoli had previously never seen, culminating in a 1987 title victory; the club\u2019s first ever Scudetto.Bellini remembers how he celebrated the victory as a six-year-old whose fandom for Napoli was burgeoning.\u201cI stayed on the balcony in my house with my flag, and you can find the picture on Instagram. With my flag on the balcony without possibility to do something or do fiesta or with the supporters, because I was very, very little. But very happy. Very proud. When I was born, I was born with Maradona and that Napoli and, always in my life, I support Naples.\u201dThree years later, Napoli reclaimed the title, once again with Maradona at the forefront.For a city and football club that had often been looked down upon by its northern rivals, that run of success was an opportunity for the region to proudly express its time on top.When Napoli won its first Serie A title in 1987, the Gentleman Ultra website notes: \u201cIn the city, mock funerals were held for Juventus. Naples finally had a riposte to their overweening Northern foes: \u2018May 1987, the other Italy has been defeated, a new empire is born.\u2019\u201dBut that four-year stretch proved to be an abnormality rather than a trend.A year after the 1990 title success, the Napoli team began to unwind with players departing, leading to a drop in performances.The headline departure came when Maradona failed a drug test and he left Italy in disgrace after being handed a 15-month ban.Following years of steady decline, the club was relegated from Serie A after claiming a miserly 14 points from 34 games. Only eight years after being crowned Italian champion, Napoli found itself in the second tier.The disappointment didn\u2019t end there though for Napoli. Despite a small respite back in the top-flight in the 2000/01 season, the club was immediately relegated after their first season back in Serie A before the club was declared bankrupt for the second year in a row, which saw it relegated to the third tier of Italian football.Although the club had fallen to its lowest league position in its history dating back to the 1920s, Bellini says the fanatical support around the club never suffered.\u201cYou can find on the Internet or in a YouTube the video when we are in Serie C with 60,000 people at the stadium and the opposing team are a very tiny team and they are not able to play in San Paolo stadium [what is now the Diego Maradona stadium] in front of 60,000 people. And this is the big passion, big passion of Neapolitan people and big love for this club.\u201dBut like a phoenix, Naples rose from the ashes; spearheaded by the most unlikely of saviors.When the club was at its most vulnerable financially, in swooped Italian film giant Aurelio De Laurentiis to rescue the club with the aim of establishing stability and a return to former glories.And De Laurentiis made good on his promises, bringing Napoli back into the Italian top-flight in three years and into European competitions in the second year back in Serie A.De Laurentiis\u2019 no-nonsense approach to running the club has brought success but has also brought tension. Fans and De Laurentiis have been at loggerheads about new proposed ticket prices although a picture posted on the owner\u2019s Twitter account suggests that that tension has been resolved for now.Schlewitz says that despite any friction against the owner, \u201ca whole lot is going to be forgiven\u201d with the title victory.Behind savvy transfer dealings and shrewd coaching appointments, the club established itself as one of Italy\u2019s elite.Khvicha Kvaratskhelia: Napoli's Georgian sensation billed 'Kvaradona'In the 16 years since the club\u2019s return to Serie A, Napoli fans have seen some of Europe\u2019s best players grace the Diego Armando Maradona Stadium pitch \u2013 from Edinson Cavani and Higua\u00edn to Dries Mertens and Marek Ham\u0161\u00edk \u2013 as well as rotating cast of elite managers \u2013 Walter Mazzarri, Rafael Ben\u00edtez, Maurizio Sarri and Carlo Ancelotti have all had stints in the Naples dugout.However, beyond cup success, Napoli was never able to reclaim that elusive Scudetto behind the dominance of Italy\u2019s northern clubs.\u201cIt\u2019s very, very hard to win in Italy because the north of Italy has a high representative of teams as Juventus, as Milan, as Inter and, in the south, it\u2019s very difficult to (win),\u201d Bellini said.\u201cFor example, Roma or Lazio in the center of Italy have only two or three times won the title because it is very, very difficult to win against the north; against the money, power of those clubs. And when we had Maradona in our club, we did this. We win against the against Juventus, against Milan, against Inter.\u201dThe 2022/23 season has been different though.Behind a previously unheralded squad \u2013 Kvaratskhelia was signed from Georgia for little fanfare, the midfielder trio of Stanislav Lobotka, Andr\u00e9-Frank Zambo Anguissa and Piotr Zieli\u0144ski have all flattered to deceive before and Kim Min-jae arrived from Turkey in the summer to transform the defense into one of the league\u2019s most formidable \u2013 Napoli has blown away the domestic competition.The team\u2019s unheralded star though, according to Schlewitz, is left back M\u00e1rio Rui. Rui signed for the club in 2017 under Sarri but has undergone a transformation this season.\u201cI have to say that I intensely disliked Mario Rui. And he just used to make all kinds of mistakes,\u201d Schlewitz said. \u201cHe came in 2017 and he would either go into tackles too hard or he would turn the ball over too quickly or just be in the wrong place at the wrong time.\u201cAnd now he is 31, and it\u2019s like he\u2019s finally grown into the player that he was always supposed to be. And I\u2019m just glad that the squad had faith to keep him around because he\u2019s kind of the anchor point. And he\u2019s not our captain in name, but he\u2019s kind of our captain in spirit.\u201dEven the team\u2019s manager, Spalletti, came to Naples with a reputation of producing beautiful footballing teams but ones that falter at the crucial moments.Whereas in previous seasons where fans would avoid talking about title challenges out of a fear of jinxing the team, Bellini says the huge lead the team established after last year\u2019s World Cup break allowed fans to dream before Thursday\u2019s draw sealed the title victory.Over 30 years after Maradona led Napoli to its last Serie A title, Osimhen, Kvaratskhelia and company have done the same to end the heartache of some of Italy\u2019s most passionate fans.And for someone who has been working inside the Napoli stadium and around the team for approximately 14 years \u2013 and as a fervent fan himself \u2013 Bellini said this moment had been a long time coming and that he has an idea of how he\u2019ll announce the team\u2019s title success to the stadium when they play at home for the first time as champions.\u201cI have something in my mind, but I don\u2019t know very well what my heart suggests to me because I don\u2019t want to prepare something special or special words for that moment because I think my heart can suggest the best word in that moment,\u201d he said.Bellini added: \u201cI\u2019ve dreamed of this moment since when I was young, and especially since when I start to do this job with Naples, I dreamed this whole night.\u201cThis is special.\u201d"

But there was a time when his life wasn\u2019t quite as.In an interview with\u2019s Coy Wire, Hamilton recollected some of his first jobs: from washing cars and selling sneakers, to serving drinks () in a bar.While the Englishman\u2019s CV has changed somewhat since his teenage days, the 38-year-old said he valued the lessons he learned from balancing college work and part-time employment with trying to fulfill his dream of becoming an.\u201cI tried a bunch of different things, but when I was at work, all I was thinking of was how I\u2019m going to win the next race,\u201d Hamilton said, looking relaxed ahead of this weekend\u2019s Miami Grand Prix.\u201cI think people do see successful people on social media and it\u2019s hard to understand how much grafting it takes to get to a good place.\u201cThe crazy thing is I\u2019m in my 17th year of this sport [\u2026] I\u2019m still grafting. I\u2019m still having to chip away. I\u2019m still having to work like never before to be able to excel in a sport that\u2019s constantly evolving.\u201cThe competition is constantly rising. It\u2019s getting tougher and tougher by the year. You just have to have the winning mindset and belief in yourself that you will get there no matter how many times you fall.\u201dLewis Hamilton on being 'the greatest you can be' and the lessons he learned from Tom BradyWinning races has come naturally to Hamilton throughout his career. In fact, no one in the history of the sport has won more.But success has been harder to come by of late, with his Mercedes car struggling to compete with the speed of.Despite becoming an underdog in the past two seasons \u2013 Hamilton has not won a race since 2021 \u2013 he believes he could one day secure a record eighth world championship title.\u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m working towards,\u201d he said.Hamilton spoke to CNN Sport at an International Watch Company (IWC) event in Miami, where he participated in basketball challenges alongside other famous faces.While Hamilton, a IWC ambassador, was not particularly impressed with his own skills on the court, he was happy to be competing in an event organized in collaboration with non-profit charity, Dibia DREAM.The US-based charity aims to bring about social change through STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) and recreational education for underserved communities, a cause which matches Hamilton\u2019s own ambitions.In addition to being a voice on issues such as climate change, Hamilton has put pressure on his sport, and wider society, to become more equal and inclusive.It\u2019s a mission perhaps born out of his own experiences \u2013 Hamiltonthat the education system in the UK \u201cfailed\u201d him after he was kicked out of school for something he said he didn\u2019t do.'I still can't put it into words': Stephanie Travers on the 'surreal' moment she became the first Black woman on an F1 podiumBlack Caribbean students were around 1.7 times more likely to be permanently expelled from UK schools compared with White British students, according to the Hamilton Commission \u2013 a report led by the driver which looked to address the underrepresentation of Black people in UK motorsport and the STEM sector.He has since channeled his own setbacks into a cause for good, setting up\u2013 a foundation that looks to support, promote and empower underrepresented young people in the UK.\u201cIt\u2019s just showing career choices, showing what STEM can lead to and encouraging young kids,\u201d he said.\u201cEducation is so key, so important. The foundation, STEM, is so important to growth and opportunity.\u201dHamilton has recently become a part owner of the NFL\u2019s. He said he spends much of his time off in Colorado and was persuaded to invest in the team after conversations he had around making positive change.\u201cIt\u2019s been quite an overwhelming experience. The opportunity came up and I leaped at it,\u201d he said.\u201cThere\u2019s not a lot of Black equity and Black leadership within sports in general, so that\u2019s something I\u2019m really passionate about being a part of changing. The further you go up the pyramid, the less diverse it is.\u201dHe added: \u201cWhen we were talking, [the Broncos] were talking about how we can really have an impact and create more diversity within the organization. That for me was the selling point.\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of work to do within the community. They already have a huge, diverse fan base, but I think internally we can also improve that.\u201dThe Miami leg of the F1 season was introduced to the calendar for the first time last year and promises to yet again attract famous faces from across the worlds of music, fashion and sport.It\u2019s a space that Hamilton feels more than comfortable in.\u201cI never really fully understood why the sport wasn\u2019t as loved here and just to finally see the growth, the amount of love the American fans have been giving our sport,\u201d he said.\u201cThere\u2019s so much warmth and excitement.

Loud boos and jeering from the crowd could be heard, as well as chants of \u201cLiverpool.\u201dAfterwards, Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp told reporters that he respected it was \u201ca big day for England\u201d but added: \u201cIt was clear that something like (the booing) would happen.\u201cThat\u2019s allowed, nothing else happened,\u201d he said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t any kind of chants or anything. People just showed \u2026 they were not always happy in the past with how the people of Liverpool, the city or the club, were dealt with.\u201dLiverpool fans have a history of booing the national anthem, most recently doing so before last season\u2019s FA Cup final at Wembley. Many also booed Prince William when he appeared on the pitch that day.The club confirmed it would play \u201cGod Save the King\u201d ahead of its match against Brentford on Saturday to respect the coronation of King Charles III, despite admitting thathold \u201cstrong views\u201d on the issue.The decision came after thethat the national anthem be played ahead of every match this weekend to celebrate the coronation services of the King and the Queen Consort, which took place on Saturday.\u201cBefore kick-off and in recognition of the Premier League\u2019s request to mark the coronation, players and officials will congregate around the centre circle when the national anthem will be played,\u201d Liverpool said in aFriday.\u201cIt is, of course, a personal choice how those at Anfield on Saturday mark this occasion and we know some supporters have strong views on it.\u201dSo why exactly do Liverpool fans have a history of booing the British national anthem? The answer has everything to do with the history of the city itself.Liverpool suffered during the deindustrialization of the UK economy in the 1970s and 1980s. In 1981, appalling economic conditions, combined with tensions between the police and the African-Caribbean community, resulted in nine days of riots in the city.Tragedy chanting: 'Vile' soccer songs about deaths fueled by 'need to hurt' opposing fansIn the aftermath of the unrest, Margaret Thatcher\u2019s government talked of a \u201cmanaged decline\u201d of the city.During this decade of Conservative rule, Liverpudlians came to see themselves as outsiders, separate from the rest of the country, and the state\u2019s handling of the Hillsborough disaster in 1989 further entrenched those anti-establishment feelings.Booing of the national anthem at football matches when the team played at Wembley \u2013 which was frequent given Liverpool\u2019s dominance of English football in this era \u2013 became widespread and remains so today.Many fans had the same reaction at the Carabao Cup final in February 2022 and at the FA Cup final in 2012.Booing the anthem is a way for some of the club\u2019s supporters to voice their opposition towards the establishment, and it\u2019s a chance to do so before a worldwide audience.The King\u2019s coronation on Saturday also comes at a time when many are feeling the devastating effects of the severe cost of living crisis that is now impacting the whole of the UK.'It's not a good look.' As cost of living crisis bites, some Brits are questioning spending money on glitzy coronationand the sudden and steep rise in energy prices have left millions of Brits on the brink of poverty.At the same time, the UK government is spending tens of millions of taxpayers\u2019 money on a glitzy celebration.Social and economic inequality is something that continues to anger many in the left-leaning city of Liverpool.Significantly, it was Liverpool and Everton supporters who started Fans\u2019 Supporting Foodbanks in 2015, an initiative which aims to tackle food poverty in the UK.When previously asked about the club\u2019s decision to play the national anthem, Klopp said \u201cthe club\u2019s position is my position.\u201d\u201cThis is definitely a subject I cannot have a proper opinion about it. I am from Germany, we don\u2019t have a king, or a queen, or these kind of things,\u201d he told reporters on Friday.\u201cI am pretty sure a lot of people in this country will enjoy the coronation, some will maybe not really be interested, and some will not like it. That\u2019s it. That\u2019s all over the country.\u201dMany feared Liverpool fans might disrupt a minute\u2019s silence for Queen Elizabeth II after her death last year but, on that occasion, only a few isolated boos were heard.CNN\u2019s Ivana Kottasov\u00e1 and Aimee Lewis contributed reporting."

        "link": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/formula1/65522015",
        "text": "Max Verstappen arrived at the Miami Grand Prix determined to make amends for his defeat in Azerbaijan the previous weekend, and he left having made an emphatic statement of his superiority over Red Bull team-mate Sergio Perez.The Mexican, by contrast, started the weekend in Florida expressing his confidence that he could keep up his unexpected title challenge against Verstappen for the entire season. He ended the race chastened, unable to explain how his team-mate had shown such crushing superiority.This was a statement victory by Verstappen, who won from ninth place on the grid with almost disdainful ease.It was not so much that the Dutchman was able to carve through the field with ease after a difficult qualifying session; it was what he did to Perez in the process.It took Verstappen just 14 laps to ease his way into second place. Perez needed to use those early laps to extend an advantage, but he was just 3.3 seconds ahead when Verstappen passed Fernando Alonso's Aston Martin.Already, Perez said, he \"knew the race was looking difficult\". And when, after his pit stop, he was unable to close on Verstappen despite having tyres that were 20 laps fresher, he knew it was over.Remarkably, by the time Verstappen made his pit stop with 12 laps to go, he was extending his advantage over Perez. He came out just a second behind and was past and gone within not much more than a lap.It was, as Red Bull team principal Christian Horner put it, \"an absolutely outstanding performance\".It was quite a statement from Verstappen, who had been flat beaten by Perez around the streets of Baku the previous weekend.\"He came out of Baku disappointed,\" Horner said. \"Checo was the faster guy there, particularly on Sunday, and Max came here really wanting to reassert himself.\"Verstappen was stunning in Miami from the off, consistently 0.5secs or so a lap faster than Perez. But things went off the rails briefly in qualifying on Saturday.Verstappen made an error on his first lap in the final session and aborted it. And when Charles Leclerc crashed his Ferrari having gone out early on the final runs, that was the session over. Ninth place it would be for Verstappen.It felt at the time as though he had handed Perez a present. As it turned out, it simply provided Verstappen a chance to demonstrate his superiority.Perez was struggling with the medium tyres in the opening stint, saying they felt \"quite fragile\". But he was barely any faster than Alonso's second placed Aston Martin, which is a considerably slower car, even if driven by an outstanding driver doing another stellar race.Either Perez was over-cautious, or he was too hard on his tyres. Whichever it was, he failed to build the advantage he needed. Then, having seen Verstappen behind him before his pit stop, he sealed his own fate by pushing too hard early in his second stint and cooking his tyres.\"Max deserves the victory,\" he said. \"He was the strongest car out there. I have to understand what went wrong. It's really simple. When you don't have the race pace, it is really hard to win the race.\"Verstappen's win had it all. He was way faster than Perez. He looked after his tyres far better, despite his pace advantage coming from the high-speed section through Turns Two to Six. And he drove more intelligently.It was a champion's drive, one that suggested Perez's title challenge will turn out to be the illusion most in F1 expect it always was.The only negative point of the day was that Verstappen was booed both during the razzmatazz, showbiz build-up to the race, when the drivers were introduced to the crowd one by one by LL Cool J, and on the podium. Verstappen shrugged it off.\"If I would be driving in the back nobody would be doing anything in terms of reaction,\" he said. \"It is normal when you are winning and they don't like who is winning. It is fine for me. I get to stand on the top. I take the trophy home and they go back to their houses and they can have a nice evening.\"Red Bull's performance underlined their superiority this season. It was their fourth one-two in five races, and the only reason they don't have a full house is that Perez had a difficult Saturday in Australia last month and started the race last.Alonso, who is having an outstanding season in the most improved team of the year, has his hopes that he might win a race this year but accepts that for it to happen Red Bull will have to hit trouble.\"Our main focus is looking behind and keeping Mercedes and Ferrari behind in the constructors' championship,\" he said. \"We have to accept Red Bull is ahead and doing a better job.\"He is a deserved third in the drivers' championship and his Aston Martin team second in the constructors'. But they are only six points ahead of Mercedes, whose drivers George Russell and Lewis Hamilton finished fourth and sixth respectively.Mercedes hope the next race in Imola in two weeks' time will be the start of what Hamilton calls a \"new path\" as they introduce a major upgrade which marks a change of design direction for their car.The hope is that this will eventually lead to them catching Red Bull. But team principal Toto Wolff is urging caution.\"We need to manage our own expectations,\" Wolff said, \"I have never in my 15 years in F1 seen a silver bullet being introduced where you suddenly unlock 0.5 seconds of performance. So I very much doubt this is going to happen here.\"What I am looking for is for us to take certain variables off the table where we believe we could have introduced something we don't understand in the car. And to go more to, let's say, a stable platform. We shall see where the baseline is and what we can do from there.\"We are chasing downforce and we are trying to do the best possible job in terms of the mechanical platform. We are introducing new bodywork and a new floor and new front suspension and that's pretty large operation, large surgery, and so it's going to be a lot of learning. In the virtual world it is good lap time.\"Elsewhere, the impression is that changes are looming at senior management level at Alpine.The team started the season, having finished fourth last year, aiming to close on the top three. But they have had a torrid time, lie sixth overall and have scored only 14 points, even with a double points finish for Pierre Gasly and Esteban Ocon in Miami, their eighth and ninth places equalling their best result of the year.Before the race, chief executive officer Laurent Rossi gave an interview to French TV station Canal Plus in Miami that underlined his unhappiness.\"This year we have started with a performance deficit, on one hand, and also an execution deficit,\" he said. \"That's a lot - and it shows. We are in a position that is not at all worthy of the resources invested, and we are far - very far - from the final objective of the year.\"What I see is, there's certainly a lack of performance, a lack of rigour in the execution, but also potentially a frame of mind that is not at the level of what had been accomplished by this same team in the past.\"Rossi used the word \"dilettantism\" to describe the first race of the season, where Ocon received three separate penalties in one grand prix as a result of a series of errors by team and driver. He said: \"The last race in Baku looked an awful lot like the one in Bahrain.\"The right to make mistakes, it is a basic principle. Mistakes are what we learn from. However, when you make the same mistakes twice, it means you haven't learned and that you aren't taking responsibility. And that is not acceptable.\"The remarks emerged on Sunday morning and somewhat blind-sided the team. What Rossi intended to achieve by them is unclear, but they are the sort of comments that tend to come before someone loses their job, or at least presage major changes.These are nervous times at Alpine."

        "link": "https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/08/sport/sebastian-steudtner-big-wave-surfing-spt-intl/index.html",
        "text": "holds the world record for the biggest wave ever surfed. At 26.21 meters (86 feet), it is equivalent to surfing an eight-story building.The record was set in the picturesque Portuguese fishing village of Nazar\u00e9, whose north beach has been hailed as the Mount Everest of big-wave surfing having been home to seven of the tallest 10 waves ever surfed.The German is a central figure in an international community of surfers who relocate to the west coast of Portugal each year for the season, which spans from October to March.But there is a method behind the 37-year-old\u2019s apparent madness \u2013 he\u2019s something of a surfing scientist in his approach to tackling the world\u2019s roughest seas.He employs a military doctor and a trained lifeguard among his team and repeatedly thinks outside the box in his approach to catch the so far mythical 100-foot wave.Steudtner is also a central figure in a new book, \u201c,\u201d a first-hand insight into a season with this mercurial bunch of sportsmen and women.The below extract from the book sees how Steudtner\u2019s alternative approach works from stepping inside a cutting-edge wind tunnel to helping inspire English Premier League football team Liverpool to past glories.\u2014When Liverpool, their manager J\u00fcrgen Klopp was left trying to uncover new ways to inspire his players and reinvigorate them after they\u2019d already achieved the pinnacle of European football.In his quest to give them an additional psychological edge against their domestic rivals and to avoid his star-studded squad turning stale after their continental triumph, he reached out to Sebastian Steudtner, of all people.How Maya Gabeira overcame a life-threatening accident to surf two record-breaking wavesOn the final day of the team\u2019s preseason training camp in Evian, in southeastern France, and just days out from the start of the 2019/20 season, he asked his countryman to both give a team talk and also teach the footballers the sort of breathing techniques Steudtner himself uses in his pool training sessions and out in the big waves to stay alive.As well as teaching them aerobic exercises and breath control for when you\u2019re in a state of panic, he also spoke about the whole mantra of staying calm under pressure.Klopp and captain Jordan Henderson have since paid tribute to the German surfer for the impact the exchange had on the players. Steudtner, for his part, brushes it all aside, in particular some articles that pushed the parameters of the story\u2019s retelling to suggest the surfer was the mastermind of thethat would subsequently follow.In the opening session in the pool that day, the breath-holding ranged from just 10 to 90 seconds at best. By the end of it, there was a straight duel for underwater supremacy between defender Dejan Lovren, who has since moved away from Anfield, and striker Mo Salah, with the pair nearing the four-minute mark by the end of it; Lovren was the last to surface.It was a session that clearly resonated with those there. For another defender, Virgil van Dijk, Steudtner\u2019s messaging of dealing with pressure particularly had meaning. Comparing Steudtner\u2019s experience of big-wave surfing to the relative triviality of his own big-game pressure, the Dutchman said, \u201cHe was like \u2018One slight mistake and life could be over.\u2019\u201dMuch like Klopp and Liverpool, in his own quest for self-improvement, Steudtner is always looking at avenues outside surfing, often casting his eye to methods from other sports and athletes in order to achieve even the most marginal of gains. Being injured and out of the water has given him even more time to do so.is probably the sport he turns to most, continually drawn back to it because of the parallels he sees between that sport and his own \u2013 and not just the poundings he takes.\u201cIt\u2019s the same thing \u2013 you have to be prepared to die. That\u2019s the first thing, at a certain level, and that\u2019s not because boxers or surfers die left and right, but it\u2019s the mentality you have to bring into the ring that has to be \u2018I am going to kill you or you\u2019ll kill me\u2019 \u2013 full stop.\u201dBut the analogy goes beyond that. \u201cIt\u2019s a dance, a strategy. It\u2019s the most beautiful sport, nothing is more technical than boxing, nothing. I love boxing. If I didn\u2019t get into surfing, for sure it would have been boxing.\u201dAt his height and weight, he would probably be in the lightweight division. You could comfortably envisage him being in the ring and, with his muscular frame, more than capable of holding his own, whomever the opponent.Russian and Mexican boxers are the fighters he most admires \u2013 the manner in which they strip their lives down to the most basic terms, taking themselves to a forest hideaway or some other Spartan existence for the most simplistic of pre-fight training camps.But the businessman in him also looks up to the British boxerperhaps more for the commercial acumen, which has seen the Briton accrue a net worth in the region of \u00a3200 million (around $250 million) and rising, than for what actually plays out between the ropes.Steudtner\u2019s own business partnerships are partly financially driven, but they are also a symbiotic relationship aimed at improving the technical side of his surfing operation. No stone is left unturned during the course of the season; everything is aimed at him improving, even when not in the water.'Mad Dog' surfer dies riding giant waves in Nazar\u00e9, PortugalAt the Porsche Development Centre in Weissach, just outside Stuttgart, he briefly takes over a wind tunnel. In place of the usual sports car stands his surfboard, with him on top of it. The German manufacturer uses its cutting-edge science from decades in the car industry to refine the aerodynamics of his body position, board and wetsuit.As the company\u2019s scientists pore over the relevant data, they ascertain that even the slightest change of Steudtner\u2019s position on the board can greatly improve the aerodynamics. It is an approach to the sport that no other surfer is currently undertaking. \u201cIt\u2019s cool,\u201d he says of the experiment. \u201cThey treat me like a car. And it\u2019s an exciting process to test all these things and see what\u2019s possible.\u201dBy his own admission, he is driven to pushing the limits of what might be achievable, even if much of his testing and tinkering fails to reach fruition. He admits, \u201cOK, maybe 80 or even 90 per cent of new things don\u2019t work \u2013 but that\u2019s just how it is, always trying and trying. It\u2019s the same with surfing. You try all the time and most of the time you fail.\u201dOn top of the wind tunnel operation, he is also partnering with Siemens as part of a research project on the biomechanics of big-wave surfing. It is a study that is not expected to be completed until some time in 2025.Steudtner ponders whether his unusual drive to push boundaries unlike his peers might be partly down to his own early influences and his adventurous nature growing up.As a child, his favorite place to go was his aunt and uncle\u2019s farm, recollections of which bring an immediate smile to his face. There was fishing in the river \u2013 he and his sister catching them with sticks, like a real-life Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn \u2013 and they would kill their own chickens for the evening meal by chopping off the animals\u2019 heads. For a then impressionable youngster, it was the ultimate adventure playground.The farming couple made a big impression on Steudtner too, and it still resonates today. He recalls the time his uncle accidentally cut his hand open, to the extent that blood was pouring out of a massive gaping wound. He simply sat down and stitched himself up. And his uncle\u2019s motto of \u201cIf it\u2019s my time, it\u2019s my time\u201d could just as easily apply to his nephew in his choice of profession.For Steudtner\u2019s uncle, that day finally came at 64, when he dropped dead from a heart attack. The surfer\u2019s aunt, meanwhile, lived on and was diagnosed with cancer at age 70. After undergoing initial treatment, she essentially said \u201cSod it,\u201d defied regular medicine and pursued her own approach and has continued to confound medical expectation to live a decade beyond the doctors\u2019 expectations.Aussie surfer sets record with mammoth 30-hour surfing session, then goes back for moreThe family were originally very wealthy in the early 20th century, owning a large farm with hundreds of acres in a picturesque valley. His great-grandfather fought in World War I, and his grandfather in World War II, posted to Italy; the job of his battalion was to destroy any resources that remained in the area and ensure there was nothing left for the enemy to employ when they arrived.That largely involved him killing animals, a part of his life that perpetually haunted him for his remaining days and from which he never fully recovered, according to the family.As his grandson puts it, \u201cHe was never the same again.\u201d In addition, it became known in the locality that he was no fan of Adolf Hitler. Word got out and, as the family story goes, someone snitched, which left the family on a deportation list. They avoided that fate when the war finished shortly afterward, he forgave his accuser and, like much of the rest of Germany, life simply moved on.The sleek lines of Steudtner\u2019s glass-fronted new home in Nazar\u00e9, with its view overlooking the ocean, is in stark contrast to that old family farm. His roots, at least for much of the season, are here in Portugal, although it is only his seasonal home.His spell injured on the sidelines has given him plenty of moments of reflection on both his past and future \u2013 and yet he has no idea when that time will run out, when the drive to be in the big waves will diminish.As much as he itches to get back in the water, he seems to thrive in the face of adversity \u2013 right now, it\u2019s the injury plight that drags on and on with still no end in sight. But in some ways, he likes it like that. Perpetually being at the top without a care in the world, he insists, would simply not suit him.He draws on another sporting parallel to highlight it. \u201cIt\u2019s a constant chase, right? At a certain point, you have to run out of performance. It\u2019s natural; it happens to everyone. Win, win, win or perform, perform, perform.Unless you\u2019re someone likethat\u2019s so obsessed, at a certain point, you\u2019re done. If I was Lewis Hamilton, I\u2019d be as bored as hell. How boring is it to win and win and win? Now things might have just got a bit more interesting for me.\u201dFor all his comments, there are still likenesses between him and the seven-time Formula One world champion. Only a year separates them in age, they have similarly spent a lifetime in their respective high-octane endeavors and both have railed against their sports. In Hamilton\u2019s case, it is in terms of the lack of diversity in Formula One and wider motorsport.For Steudtner, safety remains his fight. But there is also the shared sense that whatever they achieve in their respective disciplines, it will never ever be enough.Complete fulfillment is hard for him to attain. His familiar refrain is, \u201cI\u2019m not satisfied\u201d \u2013 and not just because of the current injury, the broken foot which put an end to.He winds the clock back to his early days in Nazar\u00e9, only his second season, and one of the biggest days he can remember. The date is not important to him, just the recollection that both he andhad surfed some of the best waves of his life, with the military doctor Axel Haber also in situ.was bouncing off the walls in ecstasy as they began to pack up at the end of the day, while Haber was equally pleased for his two friends.For Steudtner, the sensation was different. Instead of celebrating the rush of that day\u2019s water work, he was dissecting what he could have done better, lines he should have taken, how the session could have been improved, with half an eye on next time.Occasionally, it can gnaw away at him, but it is also the thing that has made him improve above all else. \u201cIt means you don\u2019t enjoy the thing so much, but that\u2019s why I improved a lot. I have friends in business and they say the same thing.\u201dButler\u2019s absence still leaves a void in his life. Close friends and long-time surf partners, Steudtner would dearly love to have him back at his side. Finding a partnership that inexplicably clicks \u2013 as his with Butler did from the very outset \u2013 is hard to attain, but the Cornishman\u2019s reappearance does not seem imminent at any point.While they are opposites \u2013 what Steudtner calls fire and ice \u2013 which equated to fighting like crazy at points, it somehow still clicked. Some relationships in Nazar\u00e9 that shouldn\u2019t work just do. \u201cTom is and will always be my brother. He\u2019s genuine, he\u2019s honest,\u201d a facet he thinks there is not enough of in the town. Theirs is and always has been an unwavering loyalty to one another.And yet loyalty is not always a buzzword here in Nazar\u00e9. Steudtner is quick to point out that some \u201cwould stab each other in the back in a second\u201d if it served their purposes, and he laughs at the nonsense of it all. It is not necessarily a criticism, just a reality of the sport and the waves that they all pursue in a perpetual quest for one-upmanship.He says of his profession: \u201cIt\u2019s not like a basketball court, where it\u2019s your turn. If there\u2019s more surfers, that means less waves \u2013 and it\u2019s a greedy sport. If I want to catch waves, I don\u2019t think about you because you\u2019re in my way, so you\u2019re naturally competitive. There are all these vibes that happen in surfing, a localism like, \u2018I was here first.\u2019 You have to be a hunter and be competitive naturally.\u201cIt\u2019s a myth that surfers are all chilled, smoke weed and help push each other into the waves. If you catch the biggest wave, you\u2019ll get famous quickly. You\u2019ve examples of Garrett [McNamara], Maya [Gabeira], me. It\u2019s whatever you need to do or feel you need to do.\u201d"

I think this is a big step for us, a young team coming here and doing all the things we did. It shows we\u2019ve come a long way.\u201dSunday\u2019s game got off to a frantic start as Jacob Murphy hit the post for Newcastle in the second minute before the home side also had a penalty \u2013 initially awarded for handball against Jakub Kiwior \u2013 ruled out following a video assistant referee review.Despite Newcastle\u2019s bright start, Arsenal took the lead through \u00d8degaard\u2019s brilliant shot from outside the box \u2013 the Norwegian\u2019s 15th league goal of the season.Both teams had chances later in the first half \u2013 Arsenal when Gabriel Martinelli and then Bukayo Saka were denied by Nick Pope and Newcastle when Joe Willock forced a good save from Aaron Ramsdale.The two goalkeepers produced excellent saves throughout the match, notably when Pope used his feet to stop \u00d8degaard getting a second right at the end of the first half and also when Sch\u00e4r\u2019s close-range header was palmed away by Ramsdale.Martinelli nearly extended Arsenal\u2019s lead when he hit the bar before playing a crucial role as his side did go 2-0 ahead, driving into the Newcastle box before seeing his cross deflected in by Sch\u00e4r\u2019s attempted interception.With that own goal, Arsenal could see out the remainder of the game in a more comfortable fashion.Mikel Arteta\u2019s side has another tough test against Brighton on Sunday before finishing the season with games against Nottingham Forest and Wolves \u2013 all of which Arsenal realistically has to win in order to boost its slim chances of overtaking City at the top of the table.\u201cThe desire to keep digging, keep believing \u2013 that reward is so big,\u201d Arteta told Sky Sports. \u201cToday, we had to do it here and we did everything we had to do to win the game.\u201d"

See what you think, then pick the order you would rank them in.: Manchester City (2010-2018)11Yaya Toure could do it all. Whether it was a powerful run the length of the pitch or curling a shot into the top corner from distance, Toure was wonderful technician. And, when he set the ball down on the penalty spot, the keeper had no chance.: Southampton (1986-2002)24Matt le Tissier was a superb midfielder, dubbed 'Le God' by Southampton supporters. But it wasn't just his mesmerising feet and effortless play that made him so dangerous - his precision from the spot was phenomenal. He only missed one penalty during his career, which was saved by Nottingham Forest goalkeeper Mark Crossley.: Liverpool (1997-2004), Charlton (2004-2006), Tottenham (2006-2007), Fulham (2007-2012)18Danny Murphy epitomised the all-action captain - leading by example, making crunching tackles, putting in maximum effort and shouldering the responsibility of taking important penalties.: West Ham (1988-1993 and 1994-1999), Liverpool (1993-1994)15A no-nonsense defender, Julian Dicks was often entrusted with taking spot-kicks wherever he played. He scored 15 penalties in the Premier League, enjoying a successful career - most notably at Liverpool and West Ham.: Arsenal (1999-2007 and 2012)23Scintillating pace, clinical finishing and the ability to take the game by the scruff of the neck, Thierry Henry is widely regarded as one of the Premier League's greatest players. He could take a penalty as well as anyone, too.: Southampton (1988-1992), Blackburn Rovers (1992-1996), Newcastle United (1996-2006)56The Premier League's all-time top scorer with 260 goals, Alan Shearer has converted the most penalties in the competition's history. No-one has come close to Shearer's 56 goals from the spot, and his no-nonsense approach to spot-kicks served him well over the years.: Tottenham (2009-present)32Harry Kane is another serial goalscorer on this list, and he is closing in on Shearer's all-time record, as well as his penalty tally. When Spurs' number 10 steps up to the spot, the ball is likely to hit the back of the net.: Chelsea (2018-2023), Arsenal (2023-present)19Jorginho's unique technique and success from the spot is well known for Chelsea and Italy. Now at Arsenal, the midfielder will hope to add to his tally of penalties, with 19 of his 21 goals in the Premier League being from spot-kicks.: Chelsea (2014-16), Liverpool (2017-present)18Another relentless goalscorer, Mohamed Salah finds the back of the net from almost anywhere. This includes from 12 yards out, with Liverpool safe in the knowledge the Egyptian's run-up usually results in the keeper being beaten.: Newcastle (2015-2018), Brentford (2020-present)11Until Ivan Toney's penalty miss in Brentford's 2-1 loss to Newcastle in April, he had not missed from 12 yards for five years. The Bees striker is calm every time he steps up, and mostly guides his efforts with enough power and precision to beat the keeper.Who do you rate as the best Premier League penalty takers?"

        "text": "Walking up the finalat Quail Hollow on Sunday, victory all but assured, Wyndham Clark made a conscious effort to soak up all the sights and sounds around him. Moments later, the American tapped home to clinch the Wells Fargo Championship and his first evertitle.\u201cYou only can win your first tournament once,\u201d Clark reflected, but this was a victory played out in his imagination countless times.\u201cIt\u2019s surreal, I\u2019ve dreamt about this since I was probably six years old,\u201d Clark told reporters in Charlotte, North Carolina.\u201cSince I\u2019ve been on the PGA Tour, you fantasize about it all the time, and I\u2019ve done it multiple times this year where I catch myself daydreaming about winning.\u201cTo do it at this golf course against this competition is better than I could ever have imagined.\u201dThe manner of victory was the stuff of dreams too, as Clark carded 19-under to seal a four-shot victory over compatriot Xander Schauffele, ranked 75 places above him at world No. 5. It marked the second-lowest score in relation to par in the event\u2019s history, second only to21-under in 2015, according to the PGA Tour.McIlroy, making his first start since missing the cut at The Masters, finished 31st in a star-studded field featuring six of the world\u2019s top 10.A final round three-under 68 sealed the 29-year-old Clark\u2019s fourth consecutive round in the 60\u2019s, a composed closer after a scintillating 63 on Saturday had given him a two-shot lead over Schauffele heading into the closing round.Having turned pro in 2017, Clark was five years and 133 PGA Tour starts without a win. After finishing sixth at the Corales Puntacana Championship in the Dominican Republic in March, the American began to think that he might never taste victory.\u201cI know that sounds crazy because I\u2019ve only been out here five years, but I had a lot of chances to where I was within two or three shots either going into the back nine or starting on a Sunday and I always seem to fall short, and not only that, but seem like I fell back in positions,\u201d Clark admitted.\u201cThere was multiple texts and calls and times when I was so frustrated with people in my camp where I didn\u2019t think I would ever win and I was like, \u2018Let\u2019s just stop talking about it,\u2019 because I didn\u2019t want to think about it. I said maybe that\u2019s just not in the cards for me.\u201cSo being in the position this time, I was like, \u2018Well, we know what not to do.\u2019\u201dTee-k Tock: The 'appalling' slow play controversy riling golf's biggest starsThose lessons were tested immediately Sunday, as Clark opened with a bogey and remained at one-over approaching the eighth tee. However, a subsequent birdie, followed by four more across the first six holes of the back nine, saw him cruise home.When he rolled home his closing bogey, Clark looked overcome with emotion. After embracing his caddie and Schauffele, he looked to be holding back tears as he saluted the crowd gathered at the 18th.Victory secured Clark the $3.6 million winner\u2019s prize \u2013 dwarfing his previous-best payday of $485,000 \u2013 and stamped his ticket to the 151st Open Championship at Royal Liverpool in July. It also saw his world ranking soar 49 places to No. 31.It fulfilled a dream that almost never got off the ground. When a 19-year-old Clark was establishing himself as a talented player at Oklahoma State University, his mother died of breast cancer.Clark lost his \u201crock\u201d and seriously considered walking away from the sport entirely.\u201cI was playing terribly,\u201d Clark recalled. \u201cThere\u2019s many times when I stormed off the golf course in qualifying or in tournaments and just drove as fast as I could, I didn\u2019t know where I was going.\u201cThe pressure of golf and then not having my mom there and someone that I could call was really tough for me. Then professionally, I\u2019ve had multiple moments like that where you just, you miss multiple cuts in a row or you feel like your game is good and you\u2019re not getting much out of it and you just contemplate doing it [walking away].\u201cMax Homa has a great quote: \u2018Every golfer\u2019s one shot away from thinking they can win the Masters or one shot away from quitting golf.\u2019 It really is a great quote because that\u2019s the truth. I\u2019m glad I stuck it out and am here now.\u201d"

The Suns owner then appeared to put his hand on Joki\u0107 who pushed back \u2013 resulting in the 43-year-old flailing back into his seat.The two-time MVP received a technical foul for his part in the kerfuffle and could now face a suspension from Game 5 of the tightly contested series.Joki\u0107 spoke on the incident postgame, saying Ishbia initiated the contact.\u201cHe (crew chief Tony Brothers) told me I was elbowing the fan, but the fan put his hands on me first,\u201d Joki\u0107 argued. \u201cI thought the league is supposed to protect us \u2013 but, maybe, I\u2019m wrong.\u201dThe two-time MVP was then asked if he knew who it was on holding on to the ball and retorted: \u201cHe\u2019s a fan, isn\u2019t he? He cannot influence the game by holding the ball.\u201dNuggets coach Michael Malone was equally as nonplussed by whether it was a fan or an owner.\u201cI think it\u2019s crazy that Nikola got a technical foul in that situation,\u201d Malone added. \u201cHe is going to get the ball, and some fan is holding on to the ball like he wants to be a part of the game. Just give the ball up, man.\u201dMalone was then told who the fan was and replied: \u201cI don\u2019t give a sh*t. I really don\u2019t care.\u201dIshbia has since taken to Twitter to share his thoughts following the altercation, saying that he does not want the two-time MVP to be suspended for the incident.The Suns owner: \u201cSuspending or fining anyone over last nights incident would not be right. I have alot of respect for Joki\u0107 and don\u2019t want to see anything like that.\u201dThis incident has only added fuel to the fire in an incredibly tightly contested series and Denver fans will be sweating over Joki\u0107\u2019s availability in what will be a crucial Game 5 clash.The two teams head back to Colorado to play again Tuesday looking to take an important 3-2 advantage into Game 6."

        "link": "https://edition.cnn.com/2023/04/29/sport/courtney-dauwalter-ultramarathon-spt-intl/index.html",
        "text": "Most people\u2019s idea of fun wouldn\u2019t involveon end through brutal, undulating terrain \u2013 butsensation Courtney Dauwalter is no ordinary person.While an ultra-marathon is technically defined as any race longer than 26.2 miles, Dauwalter\u2019s exploits tend to take place at distances far greater than that, usually between 100 to 250 miles.The 38-year-old\u2019s list of achievements is almost interminable. Dauwalter, a four-time \u2018Ultra Running Magazine Ultrarunner of the year,\u2019 holds multiple course records for the obscenely long races around the US and abroad.Dauwalter\u2019s breakout moment came at the Moab 240 \u2013 an annual 240-mile race in Utah. At the 2017 edition, shortly after making the decision to become a full-time ultra-runner, Dauwalter completed the course a scarcely believable 10 hours ahead of all other competitors \u2013 male and female.The Transgrancanaria event on February 24 \u2013 Dauwalter\u2019s most recent escapade - resulted in her 15th straight race win by gender dating back to March 2021, according to results database Ultrasignup.The Minnesota native completed the grueling 128km course (79.5 miles) \u2013 including over 7000 meters of elevation gain - around the Canary Island in a course record 14 hours 40 minutes: over 90 minutes ahead of her closest competitor.What makes Dauwalter\u2019s success even more remarkable is her approach to the sport. Given the extraordinary distances covered, you might expect her to have a forensic outlook on the craft, with rigorous training schedules, extreme diets, and advanced technology galore.In fact, the opposite is true.\u201cPre-race I\u2019ll usually go with pizza,\u201d Dauwalter tells CNN Sport. \u201cPizza is easy to find almost anywhere, it\u2019s predictable, and it\u2019s delicious.\u201cAfterwards I\u2019m often craving a beer and just a huge pile of nachos.\u201dWith regards to coaching, Dauwalter believes there is no replacement for intuition. Indeed, she doesn\u2019t even wear a heart rate monitor.\u201cThe best way for me to train right now is no coach, no plan, and really just tuning into those signals \u2013 physical, mental, emotional,\u201d she says. \u201cThen every day I can assess myself and see where I\u2019m at for the day.\u201cOne of the cool parts of this sport is that there\u2019s so many ways people go about training for these races \u2013 there is no right or wrong path to completing a 100 or 200-mile race.\u201dOn the face of it, Dauwalter\u2019s ultra-marathon supremacy is confusing. Personable, modest, and bearing a disarming grin, it is hardly the image that leaps to mind when one envisages an extreme sport phenomenon.Underneath that smile, however, lies a resolute commitment to mental strength, aided by a particular visualization exercise she created for when the going gets tough: The Pain Cave.\u201cThe Pain Cave is the place I go to in my head when it feels like I physically can\u2019t take another step,\u201d Dauwalter explains. \u201cI\u2019m a very visual person, so I\u2019ll picture actually grabbing a chisel and entering this cave in my mind, because oftentimes our bodies are wanting to tap out before we\u2019ve actually reached our limits.\u201dThe idea is that, in using the imaginary tool to extend the cave\u2019s depth, Dauwalter is extending her mental capacity to push her boundaries and turning the bodily pain into a productive exercise.\u201cIf we can just stay strong in our heads and change our mindset to something useful and positive, we can usually achieve way more than what we initially thought,\u201d she adds.That is not to say that the mind-over-matter approach comes without risk in ultra-marathons.Dauwalter says she once lost her sight completely in the closing phases of a race in 2017 \u2013 telling the Rich Roll podcast that for the final 10 miles of a 100-mile race, it was \u201cpure white\u201d in her field of vision.Hallucinations can be a common occurrence when testing human resolve to the limit in ultra-marathons. Andrew Mojica, a former psychology student at the University of Texas, toldin 2017 that \u201cat least a third\u201d of the competitors he studied in 2003\u2019s 135-mile Badwater Race in Death Valley, California, experienced hallucinations.True to character, Dauwalter has a positive and novel method of coping with the unexpected visions.\u201cAt first I didn\u2019t know that these hallucinations happened during races \u2013 I distinctly remember I was doing a race in Colorado and there were flying eels like bombing towards my head,\u201d she laughs. \u201cAnd there was a giraffe standing right next to the trail on this, like, Colorado mountain.\u201cNow that I know those things happen, and I might make some friends out there, I\u2019ve just grown to appreciate it \u2013 like, \u2018what friends might I make on this race?\u2019\u201dA former science teacher herself, Dauwalter\u2019s ongoing success against men and women has catalyzed discussions around the science of biological sex and how it contributes to performance as distance increases.\u201cThere\u2019s a lot to learn about what people are capable of in this sport \u2013 and specifically a lot to learn about what people are capable of in those races that are 200-plus miles,\u201d Dauwalter explains.\u201cEndurance and strength are factors in running a race, but suddenly in the mix you\u2019ve got the ability to problem solve, mental strength, like, stubbornness is a factor in there or the ability to stay awake.\u201dThese less tangible talents are where Dauwalter excels, and the Colorado resident is animated by the prospect of participating in the ongoing learning process around race length.\u201cAll these other skills that have nothing to do with muscle size and are skills that really anyone could develop or be naturally good at,\u201d she continues.\u201cSo, it will be interesting to see how our understanding of what\u2019s possible develops as we get more and more people doing them (longer races) \u2026 and to be a part of that is really exciting.\u201dIt feels remiss to describe someone as impressive as Dauwalter as happy-go-lucky given the breadth of her achievements, but she herself is adamant that her enjoyment of the exploits and the problem solving that comes with absurd distance is fundamental to her triumphs.\u201cFor me, training, racing and exploring what\u2019s possible with these ultra-races, the really long trail ones, is fun,\u201d Dauwalter says.\u201cAnd I love pushing my limits and seeing what\u2019s possible \u2013 so keeping that as fun as we can is top of the list of importance.\u201dUltra-marathons\u2019 inbuilt relationship with nature keeps the enjoyment fresh for Dauwalter.\u201cIt feels really special to be able to explore in that way, to appreciate how silent it can be in some of those moments and some of those places and not really know what\u2019s coming,\u201d she says.\u201cWhen you come around a corner on a trail and you have no idea of the huge view you\u2019re going to be rewarded with \u2013 it\u2019s such a cool surprise to have.\u201dThe ultra-marathon circuit is truly global. In the last year alone, Dauwalter won races in Texas, Cape Town, and the Indian Ocean island of R\u00e9union, and the runner is grateful for the travel opportunities afforded to her by the sport.\u201cI really appreciate exploring these places with my feet,\u201d she says.Dauwalter is too humble to consider ideas of legacy and achievement. She herself is \u201cdefinitely not keeping track\u201d of her winning run, she says. However, her fame and fanbase continue to grow (at the time of writing, she has 420,000 followers on Instagram).Pressed to contemplate what she would like her impact to be on the sport and beyond, her message is clear: we should all seek to push ourselves more.\u201cIn general, I think everyone\u2019s bars are just a little bit too low, and that we should raise the bar for ourselves,\u201d she says. \u201cWe should go after the thing that sounds a little bit crazy or sounds a little bit too difficult and just see, because, why not?\u201dWhether that extra exertion comes via her beloved sport is secondary, as far as Dauwalter is concerned.\u201cYes, I want more people to experience ultrarunning,\u201d she concludes. \u201cI would love people to choose that as their thing that sounds crazy that they want to try. But also, I think people can just do that with anything in their life and see what happens with it.\u201d"

        "text": "With the Sudanese capital, Khartoum, transformed from tranquil city to war zone, Saudi Arabia and the US have called the warring parties to Jeddah to seek agreement on a ceasefire. But as Sudan expert Alex de Waal says, it will just be a short-term, emergency step.There is a dilemma for mediators: whatever decision they take on the format and agenda for emergency talks will determine the path of peace-making in Sudan through to its conclusion.To silence the guns, the American and Saudi diplomats will deal only with the rival generals who have each sent a three-person negotiating team to Jeddah.The agenda is a humanitarian ceasefire, a monitoring mechanism and corridors for aid. Neither side wants to open negotiations towards a political agreement.The civilian parties and neighbourhood resistance committees, whose non-violent protests brought down the authoritarian regime of long-time leader Omar al-Bashir four years ago, will be onlookers.It will not be easy to get the two generals to agree to any kind of ceasefire.The army chief, Gen Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, will insist that he represents the legitimate government. He will label Gen Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, better known as \"Hemedti\", as a rebel.But Hemedti, his de facto deputy until the clashes, will demand equal status for the two sides.He will want a freeze-in-place, leaving his paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) fighters in control of much of Khartoum. Gen Burhan will require a return to the positions in the days before the clashes began.Getting a compromise means hard bargaining with the generals.The mediators need to gain their confidence and assure them that, if they make concessions now, that will not leave them exposed and vulnerable.The downside is that the two warring parties will then demand the dominant role in political talks and an agenda that suits their interests.One thing on which Burhan and Hemedti - and the Arab neighbours - agree is that they do not want a democratic government, which had been on the cards before the fighting began. The two military men had run the country since the 2019 which ousted Bashir, refusing to hand power to civilians.Another point of agreement will be amnesty for war crimes.Negotiations dominated by the generals are likely to end in a peace agreement in which they share the spoils, setting back the prospects for democracy for many more years.But if the fighting is not stopped soon, Sudan faces state collapse.Abdalla Hamdok - prime minister of the joint military-civilian government ousted by the generals in 2021 - has said the country's new war threatened to be worse than Syria or Yemen.He might have added, worse than Darfur.There is a grim predictability about how Sudan's civil wars unfold.In the opening days, the military commanders - army generals and rebel leaders - are driven by an angry resolve to land a knockout blow on the other side.Combat is fierce as each side focuses its attacks, and it is easy to identify who is on which side - and who is staying neutral.We saw this when the Sudanese civil war broke out in 1983, again in Darfur 20 years later, and in the conflicts in Abyei, Heglig and the Nuba Mountains close to the north-south border at the time when South Sudan separated in 2011.The first clashes in South Sudan's own civil war in 2013 also looked like this.On 15 April, when fighting erupted between the army and the RSF, each side vowed to destroy the other.They concentrated their firepower on each other's strategic positions in the capital, regardless of the massive destruction inflicted on the city and its residents.Past wars show that if the fighting is not quickly halted, it escalates.Each side brings reinforcements to the frontline, bids to win over local armed groups that are not yet involved, and solicits help from friendly foreign backers.We are in that phase now.The regular conflict script tells us the adversaries will not be able to sustain their cohesion for long. They will run low on weapons, logistics and money, and cut deals to get more.The fissures within each fighting coalition will begin to show. Other armed groups will join the fray.Local communities will arm themselves for self-defence. Outsiders will become entangled.All of this is already happening. It is most advanced in Darfur, Hemedti's homeland,.Up to now, we have not seen civilians being systematically targeted because of their ethnic identity.But that is a major risk, and as soon as fighters on one side commit mass atrocities, the antagonism will escalate.The next stage would be conflict spreading across the country, igniting local disputes as it goes.Armed groups will fragment and coalesce, fighting for control over the lucrative locations such as roads, airports, gold mines and aid distribution centres.In Darfur, after the fierce battles and massacres of 2003-04, the region collapsed into anarchy.The head of the joint African Union-United Nations mission called it \"a war of all against all\".This was the lawless political marketplace in which Hemedti thrived,.There is an all-too-real scenario in which the whole of Sudan comes to resemble Darfur.The US and Saudi mediators are high-level and even-handed. Unlike other Arab neighbours - Egypt backs Burhan and the United Arab Emirates has ties to Hemedti - Riyadh does not have a favourite.The US is threatening sanctions. That  is unlikely to deter the generals - Sudan has been under American sanctions since 1989, and military-owned businesses thrived nonetheless.Effective pressure needs international consensus. Everyone - including China and Russia - agrees that the fighting is a disaster.Protocol at the UN puts the responsibility on its African members to raise the issue at the Security Council. Up to now, they have not acted on this. The African Union convened its Peace and Security Council the day after the fighting to demand a ceasefire but has not been part of the US-Saudi mediation effort.In the meantime, every passing day risks the war becoming intractable.Silencing the guns today is a hard-enough task. It would be far harder if there were dozens of fissile armed groups claiming a seat at the table.What is unprecedented about today's armed conflict is that the battleground is in Khartoum.It is generating a humanitarian crisis quite different to the rural displacement and hunger that the country's aid workers have dealt with over the decades.Civilians trapped in urban neighbourhoods may benefit from old-style food convoys, but they also need utilities - electricity, water, and telecoms. And they desperately need cash.With the central bank burned and local commercial bank branches closed, some people rely on mobile phone banking services. Others are penniless.With the UN and most foreign aid workers evacuated,, organising essential aid and safe passage for civilians to escape.Many Sudanese feel that the international community abandoned them in their moment of need, and ask that such local, civilian efforts become the lynchpin of an aid effort.There is a danger that hunger will become a weapon of war, and aid will be a resource manipulated by warlords.Aid agencies will need to find ways to bypass them and directly help civilians.There are no simple solutions to Sudan's escalating war. The situation may yet get much worse before it gets better.And it is likely that whatever decisions are taken in the ceasefire talks - who is represented, on what terms, and with what agenda - will shape the country's future for years to come.The Sudanese forced to flee Arab militias - againHow unsung heroes are keeping Sudanese aliveThe two generals fighting over Sudan's futureWhy Sudan's descent into violence mattersWhat is going on in Sudan?

        "text": "The aroma of burning wax wafts up the tree-lined slope of Svetozar Markovic Street in Belgrade's central Vracar district. Eventually, the source of the scent comes into view: votive candles, set against a wall of white flowers.The illuminated tributes stretch around much of the perimeter of Vladislav Ribnikar Primary School and the neighbouring high school.On the barriers in front of the main entrance, there are pictures of the, along with handwritten messages from friends and family.Three girls sit on the pavement, silently holding each other. A little way down the road, a father talks quietly to his three daughters as they lay flowers. There are scores of people at the scene, with a steady flow of arrivals and departures, but there is no buzz - only a hush.The contrast to my last visit to Vladislav Ribnikar could hardly be greater. In 2013, I filmed traditional slava celebrations at the school, a joyous occasion paying tribute to St Sava through song, dance and drama.Now on the weekend of one of Serbia's biggest celebrations - the slava for St George - the country is in mourning. Not just for those who died on Wednesday, but the victims ofThere is also a sense of mourning for Serbia as people had understood it. In this country, schools had been safe and gun crime rare. Now, the two mass shootings have rocked Serbians' long-held beliefs about their society.\"Part of the shock is because no-one believed it could happen here,\" says graphic designer Ana Djordjevic. She has a 14-year-old son, and her niece is a pupil at Vladislav Ribnikar.\"My son told me he doesn't feel safe in school or on the street anymore, and that he cannot fall asleep. We need to give them time and space to process it and heal - and the teachers too.\"For most Serbians, business as usual has been out of the question. \"Belgrade never sleeps\" is usually a proud boast about the city's proclivity for partying. This weekend, the mood is palpably subdued.\"You can feel the strange atmosphere - people are sitting with no music or laughter. If it wasn't for foreign customers, we would have very little business,\" says Voja Cekic, a waiter at a popular bar and restaurant in Belgrade's Old Town.Voja then reveals that he has a gun at home - a legally licensed Beretta pistol that his grandfather carried when he fought with the Partisans in World War Two.\"I keep it as a memento of my grandfather,\" he says. \"Perhaps it could be deactivated, so I could just have it as a souvenir. But many people in Serbia have illegal guns.\"The question of whether Serbia has a gun problem has been a hot topic following the shootings. A 2018 survey by the Switzerland-based Small Arms Survey suggested that Serbia had the third-highest rate of civilian gun ownership in the world, behind only Yemen and the United States.The Belgrade Centre for Security Policy's deputy director, Bojan Elek, describes the Survey's figure of 39 guns per 100 residents as \"a wild overestimate\". But he believes the government's proposals for \"disarmament\" in the wake of the shootings will be well-received - initially, at least.\"People are still shocked and they want the government to do something. But eventually, people who legally own weapons will be angry because they will feel they didn't do anything wrong.\"Some official reactions to the shootings have caused unease, such as Education Minister Branko Ruzic identifying \"Western values\" as an underlying cause. This seems at odds with Serbia's long-stated ambition to join the European Union.\"Accusing Western values was very shocking,\" says Zvezdana Kovac, Secretary General of the European Movement in Serbia, which campaigns for EU membership.\"If one honestly wants to join the EU, one cannot say such words,\" she says. \"It is unacceptable for a serious government to misuse such an event for political purposes.\"Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic has responded swiftly to the shootings. As well as proposing a crackdown on weapons, he also suggests ensuring that a police officer is on duty at every school, and the lowering of the age of criminal responsibility from 14 to 12.But opposition parties are unimpressed. They will march through Belgrade on Monday, protesting against what they view as an attempt by the government to bring in oppressive measures while people are still stunned by the shootings.\"We don't need more police in schools,\" says Dobrica Veselinovic from the green-left movement, Ne Davimo Beograd.\"We need more psychologists, more education and an honest talk with ourselves about our position in the world and our relationship with the past. Without that, we will be stuck - we have 30 years of violent history and wars, which we have not processed.\"For the moment, processing the events of the past few days is challenge enough.

        "text": "Three-month-old Tayabullah is quiet and motionless. His mother Nigar moves the oxygen pipe away from his nose and puts a finger below his nostrils to check if she can feel him breathing.She begins to cry as she realises her son is fading.At this hospital in Afghanistan, there is not a single working ventilator.Mothers hold oxygen tubes near their babies' noses because masks designed to fit their small faces are not available, and the women are trying to fill in for what trained staff or medical equipment should do.Every day, 167 children die in Afghanistan from preventable diseases, according to the UN children's fund Unicef - illnesses that could and should be cured with the right medication.It is a staggering number. But it's an estimate.And when you step inside the paediatric ward of the main hospital in the western province of Ghor, you will be left wondering if that estimate is too low.Multiple rooms are full of sick children, at least two in each bed, their little bodies ravaged by pneumonia.\u00a0Just two nurses look after 60 children.In one room, we saw at least two dozen babies who appeared to be in a serious condition. The children should have been continuously monitored in critical care - impossible at this hospital.Yet, for the million people who live in Ghor, this basic facility is still the best equipped public hospital they can access.Public healthcare in Afghanistan has never been adequate, and foreign money which almost entirely funded it was frozen in August 2021 when the Taliban seized power. Over the past 20 months, we have visited hospitals and clinics across this country, and witnessed them collapsing.Now the Taliban's recent ban on women working for NGOs means it's becoming harder for humanitarian agencies to operate, putting even more children and babies at risk.Already defeated by a lack of resources, medics at the Ghor hospital used whatever little they had to try to revive Tayabullah.Dr Ahmad Samadi was called in to check his condition, fatigue and stress visible on his face. He put a stethoscope to Tayabullah's chest - there was a faint heartbeat.Nurse Edima Sultani rushed in with an oxygen pump. She put it over Tayabullah's mouth, blowing air into it. Then Dr Samadi used his thumbs to perform compressions on the boy's tiny chest.Watching on looking stricken was Tayabullah's grandfather Ghawsaddin. He told us his grandson was suffering from pneumonia and malnutrition.\"It took eight hours on rubble roads to bring him here from our district Charsadda,\" Ghawsaddin said. The family, who can only afford to eat dry bread for meals, scraped together money to pay for the ride.For half an hour, the efforts to revive his grandson continued. Nurse Sultani then turned towards Nigar and told her Tayabullah had died.The sudden silence which had enveloped the room was broken by Nigar's sobs. Her baby boy was wrapped in a blanket and handed over to Ghawsaddin. The family carried him home.Tayabullah should be alive - every disease he had was curable.\"I'm also a mother and when I saw the baby die, I felt like I've lost my own child. When I saw his mother weeping, it broke my heart. It hurt my conscience,\" said Nurse Sultani, who frequently does 24-hour shifts.\"We don't have equipment and there is a lack of trained staff, especially female staff. When we are looking after so many in serious conditions, which child should we check on first? There's nothing we can do but watch babies die.\"Minutes later, in the room next door, we saw another child in severe distress, with an oxygen mask on her face, struggling to breathe.Two-year-old Gulbadan was born with a heart defect, a condition called patent ductus arteriosus. It was diagnosed six months ago at this hospital.Doctors have told us the condition is not uncommon or hard to treat. But Ghor's main hospital is not equipped to perform routine surgery that could fix it. It also doesn't have the medicines she needs.Gulbadan's grandmother Afwa Gul held down her small arms, to try to prevent the little girl from pulling down her mask.\"We borrowed money to take her to Kabul, but we couldn't afford surgery, so we had to bring her back,\" she said. They approached an NGO to get financial help. Their details were registered but there's been no response since then.Gulbadan's father Nawroze stroked her forehead, trying to soothe his daughter who winced with every breath she took. Stress etched on his face, he pursed his lips and let out a sigh of resignation. He told us Gulbadan had recently begun to talk, forming her first words, calling out to him and other members of their family.This video can not be playedInside hospital where oxygen runs out\"I'm a labourer. I don't have a stable income. If I had money, she would never have suffered this way. At this moment, I can't even afford to buy one cup of tea,\" he said.I asked Dr Samadi how much oxygen Gulbadan needs.\"Two litres every minute,\" he said. \"When this cylinder gets empty, if we don't find another one, she will die.\"When we went back later to check on Gulbadan, we were told that's exactly what had happened. The oxygen cylinder had run out, and she died.The oxygen production unit at the hospital isn't able to produce sufficient oxygen because it only has power at night, and there isn't a steady supply of raw material.In a matter of a few hours, two children died of diseases that could have been prevented or cured. It's a crushing but all too familiar blow for Dr Samadi and his colleagues.\"I feel exhaustion and agony. Every day we lose one or two beloved children of Ghor. We have almost got accustomed to it now,\" he said.Walking around the rooms, we saw an overwhelming number of children in distress. One-year-old Sajad's breathing was raspy. He's suffering from pneumonia and meningitis.In another bed is Irfan. When his breathing became more laboured, his mother Zia-rah was given another oxygen pipe to hold near his nose.Wiping tears that rolled down her cheeks with her upper arm, she carefully held both pipes as steady as she could. She told us she would have brought Irfan to the hospital at least four or five days earlier if the roads had not been blocked by snow.So many simply can't make it to hospital, and others choose not to stay once they get there.\"Ten days ago a child was brought here in a very critical condition,\" Nurse Sultani said. \"We gave him an injection, but we didn't have the medicines to cure him.\"So his father decided to take him home. 'If he has to die, let him die at home',\" he told me.What we saw in Ghor raises serious questions about why public healthcare in Afghanistan is crumbling so quickly, when billions of dollars were poured into it by the international community for 20 years until 2021.Where was that money spent, if a provincial hospital doesn't have a single ventilator for its patients?Currently there is a stop-gap arrangement in place. Because money can't be given directly to the internationally unrecognised Taliban government, humanitarian agencies have stepped in to fund salaries of medical staff and the cost of medicines and food, that are just about keeping hospitals like the one in Ghor running.Now, that funding, already sorely inefficient, could also be at risk. Aid agencies warn that their donors might cut back because the Taliban's restrictions on women, including its ban on Afghan women working for the UN and NGOs, violates international laws.Only 5% of the UN's appeal for Afghanistan has been funded so far.We drove up one of the hills near the Ghor hospital to a burial ground. There are no records or registers here, not even a caretaker. So it's not possible to find out who the graves belong to, but it's easy to distinguish big graves from small ones.From what we saw, a disproportionate number - at least half - of the new graves belong to children. A man who lives in a house close by also told us most of those they are burying these days are children.There may be no way to count how many children are dying, but there is evidence everywhere of the scale of the crisis.'When I see the boys going to school, it hurts'Parks become latest no-go areas for women in KabulAfghanistan: 'Not a country but a cage for women'Who are the Taliban?"

        "text": "Carne asada, as many people know it, is grilled marinated steak, often eaten in a taco or burrito. But in Mexico and Los Angeles, carne asada is also a social event. The asada is in essence a barbecue, where a smoking grill serves as the focal point for anywhere from six to 60 people gathered on a warm night in a back garden or at the local park. The meal includes sizzling marinated meats, seafood, rice, beans, salsas and ice-cold beer cocktails.For the Mexican communities living in Los Angeles, asadas are a joyful nod to their heritage and a time to gather. \"Asadas are about love, friendship,\u00a0family and community,\" said Bricia Lopez, author of the new cookbook.\u00a0\"Every Mexican household has a big asada. It's a moment for us to get together with family.\"Lopez was born in Oaxaca but moved to Los Angeles when she was 10. In 1994, her family opened a Oaxacan restaurant called, which she currently runs with her three siblings. In 2019, Lopez wrote her first book,, celebrating her family history and the vibrant food of the region.Her inspiration for the second book stemmed from an article onthat featured the components of her asada. \"I saw the pictures in the article, and I realised how much I missed doing the asadas in 2020 and 2021 [during the pandemic],\" she said. \"I realised there are plenty of Mexican cookbooks, but not one about the meaning of asada.\" The book offers dozens of recipes for anyone looking for asada cooking guidance.According to Lopez in her book, the Mexican tradition of carne asada (as a dish) stems to the 16th Century, when Spanish Jesuit colonisers settled in northern and north-eastern Mexico, developing the cattle industry and making beef a mainstay of the local diet.It was in the early 20th Century when asadas first started smoking in American backyards and parks. \"When immigrants from Mexico started to come to the US in the 1900s, they brought along with them their love of grilled carne asada,\" Lopez wrote in her book. \"The earliest mention of a(markets that sell marinated meats) in the US in print publications goes back to 1930.\"The most common meat at an asada is(flap steak, also known as bavette steak or sirloin butt), but other meats like chorizo, lamb, pork and chicken are typically in rotation. For the poultry eaters in her group, Lopez makes: crispy chilli-marinated chicken thighs. The cinnamon and guajillo chilli (\"a very safe, well-balanced chilli that's a pantry staple in Mexico,\" she noted) are reminiscent of Oaxaca, but the vinegar in the marinade is an LA touch, inspired by the vinegary-marinated meats common in, which is popular in LA. \"The chicken is a perfect combo of smoky and sweet,\" she said.It's not a proper asada without beer, and Lopez is a very big proponent of the(she sells ain retail stores), a drink made with cold beer, lime juice, hot sauce, Worcestershire and spices. It's sometimes made with tomato juice as well. \"It is one of the most delicious drinks that Mexico ever gave the world, but it'sa Bloody Mary'' Lopez emphasised. \"It's a drink in its own right. The goal is to uplift the beer and make it spicy, tangy and salty, so you want to have three, four, five beers.\"The morita chilli in the michelada is a unique touch. \"Because this is a grilling book,\" she said, \"I wanted to bring a smoky flavour to the drink\".Lopez said that any grill can be used for an asada, but the most common one is a simple charcoal grill because it provides the requisite smoky flavour.No matter what grill you use, what meat you cook, or where you are, Lopez reminds us: \"Throwing a carne asada is an act of love.\"Bricia Lopez's Pollo in Guajillo (Credit: Quentin Bacon)Serves 412 guajillo chillies (50g/1\u00beoz), stems and seeds removed\u00bd large white onion (150g/5\u00bcoz), roughly chopped8 cloves garlic, peeled\u00bc tsp black peppercorns (about 12 peppercorns)1 whole clove1 tbsp dried Mexican oregano2 tbsp grapeseed oil\u00bc cup (60ml) orange juice2 tbsp seasoned rice vinegar2 tbsp fresh lime juice\u00bc tsp ground cinnamon1\u00bd tbsp sea salt910g (2lb) bone-in chicken thighsIn a cast-iron skillet over medium heat, lightly toast the chillies, about 2 to 3 minutes on each side.

Ice's team have bought cheap bicycles, and for weeks now they have been using them, in brutally hot weather, to reach out to residents in the smallest alleys of Bang Bon.Ice is one of a slate of young, idealistic candidates for Move Forward who have joined mainstream politics in the hope that this election allows Thailand to break the cycle of military coups, street protests and broken democratic promises in which the country has been trapped for two decades.Move Forward is the successor party to Future Forward, which exploded onto the political stage in Thailand five years ago.It contested the first election permitted since a coup in 2014 deposed the then-elected government. Future Forward was something new, promising sweeping changes to Thailand's political structures, including limiting the power of the armed forces, and, more quietly, suggesting changes to the monarchy, then a strictly taboo topic.\"Their agenda was basically about taking Thailand's future back from the powers-that-be,\" says Thitinan Pongsudhirak, from the Institute of Security and International Studies at Chulalongkorn University. \"In this century young people have had to live in a country that has been lost to an endless cycle - we had two coups, two new constitutions, a series of judicial dissolutions of parties. I think the younger demographic got sick and tired of it. And Future Forward tapped into that sentiment.\"It stunned conservatives by winning the third largest share of seats in the 2019 election. Thailand's royalist establishment, a network of military officers, senior bureaucrats and judges, responded as it has to similar threats in the past - it hadby the Constitutional Court, and banned its leaders from politics. The party lost about one-third of its MPs, and its replacement, Move Forward, became a lonely opposition voice in parliament.Yet in recent weeks the party's popularity in opinion polls has been surging again, alarming rivals. Many polls put its leader, the telegenic and articulate Pita Limjaroenrat, as the preferred candidate for prime minister.That popularity is changing the reception Ice and her bicycling volunteers are getting in Bang Bon, traditionally the fiefdom of a powerful family from a rival party. People are genuinely interested in what these youngsters have to offer. Even older residents talk about the need for big changes in Thailand.Ice herself epitomises this shifting political landscape. She admits she used to be a die-hard royalist, who cheered on the military coup and admired the man who led it,, who is still prime minister today.\"I think that I'm doing this partly out of feeling guilty that I was part of a movement that encouraged the coup, a crime against 70 million people,\" she says. \"At that time, I agreed with it and thought it was the right answer for the country. But later I asked myself, how could that happen? How could this nation support a freaking coup? And that's when I became taa sawang.\"\"Taa Sawang\" - literally, \"bright eyes\" - is the phrase adopted by younger Thais to describe their being enlightened about previously taboo topics, in particular the monarchy. It was a watchword of thethat erupted after Future Forward was banned in 2020, at a stroke disenfranchising millions of younger voters who were hungry for change.This video can not be playedThailand\u2019s youth rebellion: Mass Protests demand monarchy reformAnd that movement, while it was eventually crushed through the extensive use of the draconian lese majeste law, shattered the taboo, by calling openly, for the first time, for the powers and financing of the monarchy to be accountable. Three years later, Move Forward's support for royal reform no longer seems so shocking. And more Thais seem willing to back the party's broader agenda for change.Chonticha \"Kate\" Jangrew's journey has been from the opposite direction. Her \"taa sawang\" moment was much earlier, when she was still a student.She was among awilling to risk arrest by protesting against the 2014 coup that Ice was still cheering. She also joined the much bigger, monarchy-focused protests of 2020. But now she has decided to give up her activist life, and run as a candidate for parliament, also for Move Forward. \"I believe to achieve the changes we want we have to work in parliament as well as on the streets,\" she says.Her pitch to voters in Pathum Thani, another district outside Bangkok, is unusual. \"I have 28 criminal charges against me,\" she tells them - two are under the lese majeste law, which carries a penalty of 15 years in prison for each. \"But that shows you I am brave enough to speak out when I see something that needs to happen for our country.\"Even older voters seem charmed by her youthful sincerity. Almost everyone at the market where she appeared said they liked Move Forward, because they represented change, and would stick to their promises.For all the buzz generated by Move Forward, few believe they can win enough seats to form a government. The revised electoral system is less favourable to them than last time. And Thailand is an aging society, so voters under 26 years old - Move Forward's natural supporters - make up less than 15% of the electorate.But if the party's current surge in support holds until polling day, they could do well enough to be part of a coalition government, or a strong opposition voice. Then the inevitable question arises - will the establishment reach into its arsenal of extra-parliamentary schemes to disable the reformists once again?\"The Move Forward party's agenda is an existential challenge to the established centres of power - the military, monarchy, judiciary, the institutions and players that have run Thailand for decades,\" says Thitinan Pongsudhirak.\"Right now, they will probably wait for the poll results. But after that, the conservative establishment will have to ask themselves, what else they can do? They dissolve parties, but they come back, even stronger. They have military coups, but eventually they have to go back to a constitution. And even though they rewrite the electoral rules in their favour, their parties still lose the election.\"Why Hunger Games salute is Asia's latest protest symbol"

        "text": "During her 9-to-5, Tolu Frimpong is a marketing manager based in south-east London. But in addition to her corporate role, she is a content creator and financial coach, earning income from freelance writing, brand partnerships, affiliate marketing and one-to-one financial coaching. She\u2019s on a mission to make \u00a325,000 ($31,423) each year from her side hustles \u2013 and she wants everyone to know.Through her YouTube channel, Frimpong, 35, openly shares her financial journey. She believes talking about side income could help others meet their financial goals. However, she has never publicly disclosed her corporate salary: even though she\u2019s transparent about her side-hustle earnings and \u00a336,000 debt elimination, she still believes discussing pay with full-time colleagues is taboo.\u201cIt was only maybe a few years ago I even realised that it wasn\u2019t illegal to mention how much you earned to colleagues,\u201d she says. \u201cI've always grown up just assuming that you're not allowed to discuss salaries with your colleagues \u2026 I've just never questioned it because no one ever discusses it.\u201dYet she feels entirely differently about discussing earnings around her secondary career. She says it\u2019s because she has creative freedom and control over her work, unlike in a corporate job where she has a fixed role, and must meet the company\u2019s expectations and operate within the parameters set by them.As the, especially among young workers, so has the trend of earnings transparency among some of them. It\u2019s not just Gen Z participating in this \u2013 people across different age groups now have the platforms to publicly disclose their income, and advocate for pay transparency as well. On TikTok, the hashtag \"pay transparency\" has amassed 511.1m views and \u201cside hustle income\u201d 7.6m views, respectively, as of this writing. Many of these people report disclosing their entrepreneurial incomes to inspire others to grow their own ventures, or encourage them to build long-term wealth.Yet there\u2019s a flip side \u2013 as open as these side hustlers are about their off-hours income, many still stay tight-lipped about how much they earn from their 9-to-5 jobs. What\u2019s driving the difference \u2013 and will it change?Tolu Frimpong, 35, is hoping to make a \u00a325,000 ($31,423) from her side-hustles this year, and shares her journey online (Credit: Courtesy of Tolu Frimpong)In Spain, remote-worker Sira Masetti, 34, a quality auditor at Amazon, maintains an online side hustle publishing websites about niche topics such as self-improvement and relationships. She started the venture as a hobby in the pandemic, and saw the potential of turning it into a lucrative income stream. She posts on Twitter about how she grows her websites and makes money from them through ad revenues, which average to \u00a33,500 ($4,365) per month.\u201cSide-hustles release the \u2018inner entrepreneur\u2019 in individuals \u2013 so talking about their earnings is one way to demonstrate their success,\u201d says Jennifer Nahrgang, a professor of management and entrepreneurship at the University of Iowa, US. \u201cIn short, individuals are proud of what they are accomplishing. Individuals view side hustles as new opportunities that they can share with others to entice others to join them in their success.\u201dMasetti\u2019s intention with being open about her side income is to inspire other people to build long-term wealth. \u201cI think that having a side hustle and then transforming it in a business, if it works, is probably the best and easiest way to make money and build wealth in the long term. So, I started to share insights about my side hustle journey, because I genuinely want people to see that they can achieve financial freedom, exactly as I did, and how they can do it.\u201dBut, like Frimpong, Masetti keeps her corporate salary quiet, believing it to be much lower than what people would expect from a large company like Amazon. She\u2019s worried others will assume she\u2019s worth what she earns at her corporate job, and label her unfairly, even though the job is what she needs right now. \"People may think that in more than five years I wasn't able to make more, or that I wasn't able to grow in the company.\"34-year-old Sira Masetti makes about \u00a33,500 ($4,365) per month off her side hustles (Credit: Courtesy of Sira Masetti)Another reason these creators may keep their full-time earnings close to their chests, says Nahrgang, is that colleagues at the same company may feel like they are competing for pay or that salary disclosures might create tension.This rings true for Matt Brighton, 30, a senior product manager in financial services with multiple side hustles as a content creator and property investor. Based in Sheffield, he earns what he calls a \u201chigher than UK average\u201d salary in his corporate role at Remote, an HR solutions start-up, but prefers to keep the exact amount private. He believes sharing corporate earnings could potentially expose him to rumours, or make it awkward with any of his current co-workers who might be earning less.However, Brighton is transparent about his side-hustle earnings. Last year, he made more than \u00a330,000 from those projects, and he has already earned more than that in the first quarter of this year. \u201cLet\u2019s say I share my side income this year and it\u2019s more than someone at Remote makes on their full-time salary. I\u2019d still feel fine because it\u2019s my outside business that has nothing to do with the workplace. They can only look at it with inspiration because that\u2019s not something they can control.\u201dLast year, Matt Brighton, 30, made more than \u00a330,000 from side-hustle projects (Credit: Courtesy of Matt Brighton)While discussions of pay in the corporate world has long-standing rules and unspoken practises that tend to protect the employers, experts say the emergence of side hustles \u2013 and the transparency around them \u2013 has the potential to shake up norms around pay transparency.Gabriela Serpa Royo, an analyst at Canvas8, a global behavioural insights practice, explains, \u201cFor many, the act of publicising side hustles feels a bit like speaking into a void. There\u2019s no boss, or colleague to measure yourself up to.\u201d She adds, \u201cThe creator economy is fairly new, which is why it\u2019s fertile playing ground for new work rules. Through side hustles, people are playing with taboos to reinvent norms for a more transparent, inclusive workforce.\u201dAdditionally, says Serpa Royo, there\u2019s no guidance set by HR or clear career paths laid out in the world of side hustles; instead, people have to turn to each other for information about the steps they take and how much they make, which is often encouraged on social media.It remains to be seen whether sharing side-hustle earnings will trickle down into more transparency around full-time pay. However, experts including Rameez Kaleem, founder and director of 3R strategy, a London-based independent HR consultancy, say they\u2019ve seen a push for increased pay transparency among young workers. Even if the progress is slow, this evolving attitude, combined with movements such as side-hustle income sharing, could pave the path for a new era of salary disclosure."

        "text": "On Friday 2 April 1982, Argentina invaded the British overseas territory of the Falkland Islands.It had claimed sovereignty over the islands for many years. The country's ruling military junta did not believe that Britain would attempt to regain the islands by force.The ruling military junta was wrong.Britain, under Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, assembled warships, refitted merchant ships and sent a task force 8,000 miles (12,900 km) across the globe to the South Atlantic.Over the next 10 weeks, 649 Argentine military personnel, 255 British military personnel, and three Falkland Islanders were killed.Forty years on, Tamsin McLeod, an islander who grew up in the shadow of the conflict and now lives in London, tells the BBC what her homeland means to her - and how the island families coped with their peaceful lives being thrust into the arena of war.\"Our nickname is 'Kelper' because of all the seaweed and kelp surrounding the islands, so I'm a Kelper or Falklander first and British second, and on the islands we are so, so eternally grateful for what the British did. I probably wouldn't be here today if that task force had not been sent.\"My parents didn't really talk about it to me much as I grew up.\"It was something that happened, where you have the Liberation Day and the parades and the receptions, and you attend them and everything. And it's very personal.\"But the older I've become the more my parents have opened up about it. My parents would say in passing, 'oh, yeah, your aunt and uncle were locked in the Goose Green town hall for 30 days'.\"During the war more than 100 islanders were held at gunpoint and imprisoned in the community hall at Goose Green. They had been summoned to a meeting there by Argentine officials. They were kept at the hall, in appalling conditions, for nearly a month.In just two months of hostilities in the Falklands, 891 men died, 132 aircraft were lost, and 11 ships were sunk.\"It was always there. It's always in the background. It's the legacy of the conflict - especially with the landmines. It was completely normal to be surrounded by bits of land you couldn't go on, fenced off because there were landmines and if you step on one you could die.\"So going on a walk, it was like, 'oh, yeah, here's wreckage from a helicopter or something from the war'.\"When the invasion happened, my mum was completing her O-levels. Imagine these being interrupted for three months, because you're being occupied and you're being told you have to learn everything in Spanish.\"All of a sudden, you have to drive on the opposite side of the road, you've got a curfew.\"My mum really, really vividly remembers Argentine soldiers turning up at her doorstep because my granddad was the local butcher at the time, and they were like, 'you need to kill mutton and feed us'.\"And my granddad - he was born in England, he vaguely remembers the Second World War, and he did his national service before moving to the islands. And so he's like, 'I'm not putting my family at risk'. So he shipped his whole family out to Horseshoe Bay, which is another farming settlement in the middle of nowhere.\"And that's my mum's main experience of the war - her dad being genuinely fearful.\"Margaret Thatcher addressed the House of Commons on 3 April:\"My dad is slightly older. He turned 18 in April during the conflict, he and his brother were helping feed and cook for the British soldiers. They gave their car, their motorbike, the jeep. People stayed on their floor. They were trying to do as much as they could.\"My dad was a young man at that time and there were people his age dying, soldiers dying.\"You couldn't really escape it. But then in a positive way, you appreciate how lucky you are, how privileged you are. To call yourself a Falkland Islander, to be six generations to grow up here, to have a childhood surrounded by penguins and beaches, to have insanely good fresh air.\"\"The way I grew up, it was 'appreciate what you've got, because we could have really not had this'.\"When I came to the UK, people knew nothing about the Falklands, genuinely nothing. Especially people my age.\"Occasionally some mention penguins - and sometimes you meet a friend's parents in their 40s or 50s and they remember the conflict.\"It's like, 'I remember hearing about it on the radio or seeing it on the television. Wasn't there a war in the 80s? Wasn't Margaret Thatcher involved?'\"That's all they knew.\"\"I grew up there, it's my home. So it was completely normal. I didn't know anything different until I moved away and then went, 'oh, hang on a second, there's a whole wide world here'.\"There's still such a strong, strong feeling. My parents are still really close with lots of veterans. They're genuinely family friends.\"My godmother lost her son on the Sir Galahad. She came to the Falklands to see where he lost his life. And it's terrible, terrible circumstances. I don't think a mother should ever have to do that. And she stayed with my family and returned to the island several times since that original visit.\"And because of that relationship, she became a really important part of my life.\"On 8 June, while preparing to unload soldiers from the Welsh Guards in Port Pleasant, RFA Sir Galahad was attacked by the Argentine Air Force, each carrying three Mk 82 500lb (227kg) bombs.Sir Galahad was hit by two or three bombs, which exploded and started fires. The explosions and subsequent fire caused the deaths of 48 crew and soldiers.\"People should care about the war. People lost their lives.\"We are very resilient. We fight for what we believe in and we really want to continue to fight to be British.\"The island has moved on from the war. We have made the most of the sacrifices lost. We still remember the past and we appreciate everything that's happened. But we're looking to the future now.\"We do not have a positive relationship with Argentina at all. It's not civil at all.\"We are not just statistics and geography - we have heritage, we have history, we have lived experiences that are very valuable to us.\"We're becoming the gateway to Antarctica on that entire side of the world, which is amazing. We're the scientific hub of the South Atlantic. We have more than 60 different nationalities, including a growing population from Zimbabwe due to the de-miners coming and removing the landmines, so we are really cosmopolitan. And we're really proud of that.\"I probably will go back. It's home. It's where my family are. I love going home and visiting them and seeing friends. It's a lot slower.\"That soil is my home. So I carry a piece of it with me wherever I go. My necklace has Falklands sand in it and I promise you, it does not come off. Ever.\"The Falklands are a part of me and I'm a part of them.\"Tamsin's story is taken from- a BBC Local Radio podcast focusing on people whose lives have been affected by the Falklands War.Follow BBC London on,and.

        "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-60836892",
        "text": "Some British farmers are calling for a ban on the UK production of toxic weedkiller Paraquat, saying studies suggest it could be a factor in the onset of Parkinson's Disease. It comes as hundreds of US farm workers pursue a legal case against its manufacturer, alleging it knew the risk and failed to warn them.Andy Pollard was once a farm manager who could leap into his tractor cab. But now his limbs are rigid and his body contorts with spasms. He has advanced Parkinson's Disease, and can no longer control his own movements.He spent decades spraying herbicides on his land and, unaware of any danger, didn't use protective equipment.\"Paraquat was a really good thing to use - or so we thought,\" his wife Sue says. \"Andy would be driving around the fields and the spray would be going everywhere.\"She had thought it was a coincidence that the only people she knew with Parkinson's were farm workers, then read about the potential connection with the chemical.\"Why hasn't it been regulated and stopped?\" she asks. \"We've got a lot of people in the same situation.\"Paraquat was first manufactured in the UK in the early 1960s and is sold globally - 377 companies have registered it for sale.It is one of the world's most popular and effective herbicides, millions of farmers have used it to kill weeds. But it is also one of the most dangerous and has caused thousands of poisoning deaths.Its manufacturer Syngenta says claims of a link between Paraquat and Parkinson's are not supported by scientific evidence, stating it has undergone more than 1,200 safety studies.Andy regularly visits a Dorset farm run by charity Countrymen UK, founded by Julie Plumley after her father John was diagnosed with Parkinson's.The 30-acre working farm sells beef and lamb. In the yard, instead of tractors is a fleet of mobility scooters. \"The farmers come here not because they're ill,\" Julie explains, \"but because they want to get on with living.\"Parkinson's Disease is believed to be the world's fastest-growing neurological condition. It affects neurons in a specific area of the brain called the substantia nigra.It is degenerative, gradually leading to tremors and stiffness in the limbs. Global studies show rural, agricultural areas often have higher rates of the disease.Julie explains her childhood farm was owned by the local council, so her father had to meet certain conditions. \"He had to use chemicals, because if you got too many dock leaves or thistles, they could take money away from you. Paraquat was the pesticide all the farmers used.\"He would carry a backpack filled with the chemical and spend hours hand-spraying the fields. \"He would have his sleeves rolled up, his arms bare, the liquid dripping down.\"John developed the disease in his 40s and always believed there was a connection to the chemicals. His suspicion deepened when his neighbour Ken Barnes was diagnosed around the same time - he was also in his 40s and had also been using Paraquat for years.Ken now visits Julie's farm. He has a twinkle in his eye, but his clarity of speech has gone. \"It's a horrible disease,\" says his wife Sue. \"It's taken his life away.\"She says its manufacture in the UK and export should be stopped. \"I wouldn't want my son, who's got farming qualifications, ending up like his father.\"Paraquat has not been authorised for use in the EU since a court ruling in 2007. That is still the case in the UK after Brexit but it is still made - under the brand name Gramoxone - at Syngenta's plant in Huddersfield. It is exported to countries such as the US, Japan and Australia, with a fifth of exports going to the developing world.In the US, nearly 900 farmers and field workers have joined forces to sue the manufacturer, claiming not only is there a link between Paraquat and Parkinson's, but that Syngenta has deliberately hidden the health risks from the authorities.Syngenta rejects the claims made in the remaining multidistrict litigation case, which is due to come to court later this year.The company's most recent financial statement shows that the company has already paid $187.5m into a settlement fund. But it said the company believes that all of these claims are without merit and the payment is simply to keep the claims from going any further.Toxicologist Prof Jon Heylings worked for Syngenta and its predecessor companies for more than 20 years. After retiring, he turned whistleblower, and has given evidence as an expert witness in the US legal action.He said farmers who used it without protective equipment, damaging their skin, should be worried. \"If they went out the next day and actually used it again, and the next day, you could absorb more Paraquat through the skin, into the blood and then into the brain,\" he says.\"The issue is really does it actually cause Parkinson's when it gets into the brain? That's one of the key issues around the whole exposure. And if this chemical does cause Parkinson's, who is responsible?\"There is no scientific consensus and many conflicting studies on any possible association between Paraquat and Parkinson's.In the UK, research charity Cure Parkinson's said exposure was \"a well-recognised environmental risk factor\" but Parkinson's UK said studies show \"a small increased risk\" at most.In the US, a 17-year-long study found Paraquat contributed to Parkinson's onset and progression. And research by the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences - part of the US Department of Health - found people who used Paraquat developed Parkinson's two-and-a-half times more often than non-users.But the US regulator, the Environmental Protection Agency, says an updated study couldn't replicate those results and no clear link was found.But there are scientists who believe Syngenta is putting profit before product safety and public health.Prof Heylings has a Syngenta regulatory strategy document from 2003 written while Paraquat was still being used by UK farmers. Its author acknowledges a growing number of studies \"citing a correlation between incidence of Parkinson's Disease and herbicide use, including Paraquat\".He explains: \"Syngenta are trying to influence researchers who are working on Paraquat and also influence the direction of the research because the last thing Syngenta wants is a big blow up on Parkinson's. So the strategy was to downplay anything to do with the potential neurotoxicity of Paraquat that could lead to Parkinson's.\"It said: \"In our view, Jon Heylings is technically not qualified to comment on Paraquat and Parkinson's Disease. He is certainly not aware of Syngenta's research on the issue, which was mostly conducted from 2008 onwards, after he left the company. We spent tens of millions of dollars investigating Paraquat and Parkinson's disease - and this figure doesn't include the monetary value of internal expert time.\"In a statement, Syngenta said it had invested hundreds of millions of dollars over the product lifetime to ensure its safety.\"Paraquat has been the subject of more than 1,200 safety studies submitted to, and reviewed by, regulatory authorities around the world. Recent thorough reviews performed by the most advanced and science-based regulatory authorities including the United States and Australia continue to support the view that Paraquat is safe.\"Photos bySee the full story on Countryfile on BBC1 at 17:30 BST on 3 April and afterwards on the iPlayer."

        "name": "The guitarist who saved hundreds of people on a sinking cruise liner",
        "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-60841291",
        "text": "When the luxury liner Oceanos started taking on water in rough seas during a voyage around the coast of South Africa in 1991, musician Moss Hills and his colleagues suddenly found themselves responsible for everyone on board.It was during dinner that Moss Hills began to realise just how severe the storm was. The ship's waiters, normally completely adept at carrying drinks and food without spilling anything, were struggling. Moss, a guitarist from Zimbabwe working on board the cruise liner alongside his wife Tracy, a bass player, had never seen the waiters dropping trays before.Earlier that day, gale-force winds and heavy rains had delayed sailing for the final leg of the cruise towards Durban several times. But with no sign of conditions improving, the captain eventually decided to lift anchor and the Oceanos, with 581 guests and crew on board, sailed off into 40-knot winds and 9m-high (30ft) waves.Moss and Tracy, both in their 30s, would usually host parties up on the pool deck as the ship sailed away from port. But that day the party had been moved indoors, and Moss braced his body while he played his guitar, trying to keep his balance as the ship pitched and rolled.\"The storm just got worse and worse,\" Moss says.At dinner, Tracy - who her husband describes as unflappable - decided to go to their cabin to organise an emergency bag, just in case.\"Off she went,\" Moss says, \"and suddenly - boom - all the lights went out.\"When none of the ship's officers appeared to issue instructions, Moss, who was not easily frightened, began to feel uneasy.\"You're on a ship in the middle of the ocean, in the dark of night, in a terrible storm,\" he says, \"I felt this tightening in my stomach.\"When small, dim emergency lights came on, Moss went up to the lounge to check on the musical instruments on stage. Microphone and cymbal stands were strewn about. Then he suddenly realised he couldn't hear the constant, throbbing, background noise of the engines. The ship had lost power and was slowing down.Soon the 153m (502ft) Oceanos was drifting sideways onto the crashing waves.The ship, says Moss, was getting hammered.Anxious guests began pouring into the lounge. Pot plants, ashtrays, and chairs were sliding around, and people had to move from their seats to sit on the floor as the ship lurched wildly from one side to the other, port to starboard.About an hour passed, and the mood in the lounge grew tense. Moss grabbed an acoustic guitar and began singing with some of the other entertainers to try to keep people calm. But as time stretched on, Moss noticed that the ship was heeling - no longer coming back to a level position when it was being thrown about in the storm.\"Something bad is happening,\" Moss said to Tracy, \"I'm going to try and find out what's going on.\"Hear Moss tell his story in a new series ofon 6 April 2022 at 0900 on BBC Radio 4 - or listen to the.More from Life Changing:Hanging on to the handrails, Moss and another entertainer, Julian, a magician from Yorkshire, made their way through the darkness below deck. They could hear excited voices speaking many different languages. Officers were running around, some were carrying bags, some had life jackets on, and some were wet.\"Everyone was pretty wild-eyed and panicked-looking,\" Moss says. \"We were trying to ask, 'What's happening?' but it was like we didn't exist.\"Julian and Moss continued down to the engine room - the lowest part of the ship.\"We were way below the waterline, in the dark, on our own, and there was no-one there,\" Moss says. \"That would never, ever happen, even when you're docked.\"The thick, metal doors which acted as a safety barrier by preventing water moving from one compartment of a ship to another in the event of flooding, were tightly closed.\"But it sounded like there was a large body of water sloshing about behind those watertight doors,\" Moss says.The Oceanos was sinking.Back up in the lounge, there had still not been any announcements about what was going on. Moss found the cruise director who said the captain had told her they were going to have to abandon the ship.\"Then we found out that one lifeboat had already gone with a lot of the crew and senior officers on it,\" he says.Moss and the others had no idea how to evacuate a cruise ship, nor how to launch the lifeboats which hung high above the deck along each of the ship's sides, but there was nobody more qualified around to do it.One by one, they began lowering the starboard side lifeboats down to the deck. They didn't know how to keep them steady as people got on, so Moss improvised by standing with one leg on the deck of the ship and the other on a lifeboat.But each time the ship rolled to starboard, Moss would have to jump back onto the Oceanos before the lifeboat swung away, opening up a gap of a couple of metres, and then swung back, smashing with such force against the ship's hull that bits of it came splintering off.Each heaving lifeboat, now with as many as 90 people in it, many screaming in fear, would then be lowered down to the sea on cables. But Moss had no idea how to start the engines or even where the keys were.\"We'd let them go, off into the night, and they would just drift away into the pounding waves,\" he says. \"The people in the lifeboats had a torturous time - they were getting deluged in spray, it was cold and completely dark, but we just had to carry on until all of the starboard side lifeboats were launched.\"By now the Oceanos was taking in more and more water and heeling markedly to its starboard side. Launching the remaining lifeboats on the port side safely was near impossible.Instead of being lowered down to the water once loaded up with people, the lifeboats would cling to the side of the ship until the next big wave rolled in, tipping the ship enough to let them dangle freely.\"And then gravity would suddenly drop the lifeboat three or four metres (13 ft) in one go, almost tipping people out into the open water, it was horrific,\" Moss says.Eventually, he realised it was too dangerous to continue.\"In the effort to try and rescue people we were possibly going to kill them,\" Moss says.And time was running out.Unable to launch any more lifeboats, but with hundreds of people still in need of rescue, Moss and others made their way up to the ship's bridge - where they assumed they would find the captain and the remaining senior officers - to ask what to do next.\"We looked inside, but there was no one there,\" Moss says. \"That's when we realised - it's just us.\"Orangey-red lights blinked in the darkness, but Moss had no idea what most of the equipment was for, never mind how it worked. They took turns trying to use the radio to send an SOS.\"I was calling, 'Mayday! Mayday! Mayday!' and just waiting for somebody to answer,\" Moss says.A big, deep, rich voice eventually replied. \"Yes, what is your Mayday?\"Relieved, Moss explained that he was on the cruise ship Oceanos and that it was sinking.\"OK. How long have you got left to float?\"\"I don't know - we've got the starboard railings in the water, we're rolling around, we've taken on a huge amount of water,\" Moss said. \"We still have at least 200 people on board.\"\"OK. What is your position?\"\"We're probably about halfway between the port of East London and Durban.\"\"No, no, no, what are your coordinates?\"Moss had no idea what their coordinates were.\"What rank are you?\"\"Well, I'm not a rank - I'm a guitarist.\"A moment's silence.\"What are you doing on the bridge?\"\"Well, there's nobody else here.\"\"Who's on the bridge with you?\"\"So I said, 'It's me, my wife - the bass player, we've got a magician here\u2026'\"Moss was put in contact with two small ships that were close to the Oceanos. They told Moss to find the captain and get him onto the bridge. But Moss had no idea where he was.\"I knew he wouldn't be down below because we were sinking,\" he says. \"I was making regular checks to see where the water level was, and one deck below us was flooded.\"Eventually, Moss found the captain, right at the back of the ship, smoking in the darkness. Moss explained that they needed his help - urgently.\"He was just looking at me, wide-eyed and vacant, saying, 'It's not necessary, it's not necessary,'\" Moss says.\"I think he was in deep, deep shock.\"The two ships close to the Oceanos had only one lifeboat each, so there was little they could do to help. They shared the sinking vessel's coordinates with the South African authorities who began to organise an air rescue mission.As the storm continued to batter the ship, Moss and Tracy sat together in the near darkness, praying that help would arrive before it was too late.\"I think the ship is going to go down and it's very likely we're going to go down with it,\" Moss said to his wife.He and Tracy had a 15-year-old daughter, Amber, who'd been on board the Oceanos for the holidays and disembarked just days earlier. Amber was now back at boarding school in South Africa.\"She can't lose both parents,\" Moss remembers saying. \"Whatever we do, we've got to make sure at least one of us gets off.\"More than three hours passed before the first rescue helicopter arrived and hovered above the ship.Two navy divers were winched down to the Oceanos' deck. They said they needed help to get everyone off before the ship sank, and Moss was given a five-minute crash course on how to run a helicopter airlift.\"Remember, the harness needs to be quite tight under people's underarms,\" the navy diver told him. \"Make sure you get it right because otherwise they'll tip upside down and fall out - you'll kill them on the deck. Do two at a time or else we're going to run out of time. OK? Go.\"One navy diver went to organise the helicopter rescue at the rear of the ship and Tracy and Moss were to organise a second at the front. But as the ship sank ever lower beneath the waves, people began jumping off the steeply pitching deck in panic and a rigid inflatable had to be launched into the churning sea to rescue them.Dangling in mid-air from the helicopter cable, people who Moss was trying to save were being blown against parts of the ship by the strong winds as they were winched into the sky. There was no way of knowing how badly hurt they were and Moss momentarily lost his nerve. But with so many people still on board, he realised he had no choice but to keep going.In total, five helicopters joined the rescue mission, shuttling back and forth, carrying 12 people at a time to safety as dawn broke and the darkness lifted.Drained and exhausted, Moss and Tracy were among the last to be strapped into harnesses.\"As we were hovering above the ship it really hit me,\" Moss says, \"I could see the Oceanos was in a critical situation. We could see waves breaking over the bow where we had been rescuing people.\"When the helicopter carrying Moss touched down on the grass, cruise passengers ran towards him singing and cheering, and reaching out to hug him.\"I started to choke up and sob,\" Moss says, \"and then I collapsed.\"On 4 August 1991, about 45 minutes after the last person on board had been airlifted to safety, the Oceanos slipped away below the water. Everyone who had been put into lifeboats was rescued by passing ships and remarkably no lives were lost.Moss and Tracy, who now live in Liverpool, continued working as cruise ship entertainers for many years. Even now, three decades later, Tracy prefers not to talk about the sinking or dwell on how close they all came to losing their lives.But Moss, who's been asked about the Oceanos many, many times, finds it cathartic to talk about. He looks back on what happened with great relief.\"I'm not invincible,\" Moss says, \"but if I can get through that, I can get through anything.\"Listen to Moss Hills on- producer Thomas Harding AssinderDo you have an extraordinary story to tell?

        "text": "The first generation who came to post-war Britain from the Indian subcontinent arrived with as little as \u00a33 in their pockets - all the money they could bring in under strict currency controls. Their descendants, in their millions, are part of the make-up of contemporary Britain, but many of their stories are still to be told - and they reveal so much about the process of migration.Mohammed Ajeeb arrived in Britain in 1957 from Pakistan with a battered suitcase. His first home was in Nottingham with 28 other men from Mirpur, in Pakistani-administered Kashmir. He'd had a clerical job in Pakistan but could only find work in a factory.\"I cried at night in my bed,\" he confesses. \"I wanted to go back but I didn't want to be seen as a failure. I thought, 'I'm a determined young man, I want to succeed by hook or crook in this country,' and that carried me.\"Over the years, he fought many battles for equal pay and against racism - but he stayed and went on to become the mayor of Bradford.The 1948 British Nationality Act meant people who came from the former colonies or the empire automatically became British citizens. Britain needed workers to rebuild the country after World War Two.Many who came in the early years from the Indian subcontinent were single, young men. They mostly worked the difficult shifts in the factories, foundries, and textile mills in places like Birmingham, Bradford, and West London. These men thought they were coming for only a few years: they never imagined generations of their family would one day live here.Gnawing loneliness, and missing family, was part of life for these pioneers, the so-called \u00a33 generation. Many wrote to their family on blue aerogram letters.Gunwant Grewal came over from Ludhiana, Punjab in 1965. Life wasn't what she had imagined. She had been a teacher in India, but could only find factory work when she arrived.She lived in a room in Southall, west London, with her husband and daughter in a shared house, a far cry from her spacious home in India. She desperately missed her father who she wrote to regularly.\"My tears were on my letter as I was writing. My father said, 'Why was your letter damp?' and I said, 'Oh I was having a cup of tea,' when really it was tears. But slowly, slowly it got better.\"One time walking past a bus stop, she saw an elderly Sikh man who reminded her of her father. She spontaneously hugged him.A phone call to hear a loved one's voice was out of the question. Ravi Patel arrived in 1967 with \u00a31, having spent the rest on the journey over to Britain. He recalls that phoning India cost \u00a31.40 per minute, a vast sum then. So Ravi called his family in Ahmedabad, Gujarat, twice a year: once on Diwali and once on his father's birthday.It remained that way until the early 2000s, when communications were revolutionised by companies like Lebara, which was started by three British-Sri Lankan entrepreneurs and offered cheap telephone calling cards.You could now phone the Indian subcontinent for as cheaply as one penny a minute. Decades after Ravi left India, he could now speak to his best friend whenever he wanted.When I started interviewing these pioneers nearly a decade ago, their experiences were not widely documented, but in recent years there has been a growing interest in the stories of people who came from the former empire and made their once colonial ruler home. And the struggles of that generation for equality and against racism are now better known.Each generation has a different attachment to the place left and the place where they now live - but these private, and sometimes delicate, tussles between parents and children are rarely recorded.I have been reporting on the ups and downs of, who came in 1968 as a young bride from Dhaka, East Pakistan, now Bangladesh. Farah was born a year later. Runi's generation often bore and raised their children alone, without the support of their own mothers or any wider family. For the next generation, it was different.In late 2001, Farah was in Liverpool when she called her mother in London to tell her she was about to give birth. Runi says, \"I started to shiver and scream because I'm her mother and I should be near.\" She jumped into the car and drove to Liverpool. She arrived to be told her grandchild had been born. \"That was the happiest moment of my life,\" Runi smiles, \"I am eternal now.\"Waiting in the hospital corridor to see them jogged a memory. She remembered giving birth to Farah and writing a letter to her mother in then East Pakistan, saying she now realised what being a mum meant.Runi recalled lying in the hospital bed with her newborn, in pain, and how she missed her mother who was so far away. She was hungry and wanted to be comforted by her mother's food. So when, decades later, she walked into Farah's room and met her grandson, she remembered that hunger and ache for her own mother.She asked Farah what she wanted to eat. Chicken biryani, she replied. Runi searched Liverpool's halal shops and made that dish for her daughter.Three Pounds in My Pocket Series 5 starts on Friday 8 April at 11:00 BST on. You can hear the previous seriesFarah, after giving birth to her son, had her own revelation. \"Within seconds of becoming a mum, I had a completely different appreciation of what my mum must have gone through. She didn't have any real extended family around, compared to how supported I felt.\"Five years later, in 2006, Farah had another child and decided to return to London, to be near her mother. She had left the family home in 1988 wanting to get away from the burden of her parents' expectations, with a yearning to live her own life, her way.In deciding to come back to be near her parents, she wanted to give her children something she never had - grandparents. Hers had lived in Bangladesh and she barely saw them.Hearing Farah, I realised that there must be many thousands from the second generation, born in Britain, who grew up orphaned from their grandparents. This relationship between our children and their grandparents - the pioneers - has such a precious meaning for us, as it was something we never had.For Farah, life had come full circle. She wanted her children to be immersed in Bengali food, culture and language - things that were so much a part of her parents' home. It was the same home Farah had wanted to escape in the late 1980s. \"When you're young, you want to fit in, and when you're older, you're just confident - fitting in matters less than the things that made you who you are.\"Testimonies like these are an important part of the story of migration and the story of Britain. What began as an empire ended up with former subjects of the Raj settling as citizens, with generations now living here. Each individual making a choice about what to discard from the place left behind and what to hold on to in Britain.Runi's husband died last year. Her voice breaks as she tells me, \"It feels like you build a house and you start with one brick. I built the whole big house over the years with him. We fought, we argued. But we wanted to build that house, and we did.\"He is buried near their home in London. As a young man, he wanted to rest in Bangladesh's earth, in the family plot there.But later, he realised his home was where his children and grandchildren were. His centre of gravity had shifted.There had been many difficult and lonely times, but now three generations were successfully established in Britain. Runi tells me she has reserved a plot next to his. \"I feel that this is a big tree, solidly rooted into a land, and it cannot be pulled out.\"'How I became a secret daytime DJ'"

        "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/world-63727404",
        "text": "Digital travel scams are a growing \"systemic and global\" problem, according to the World Tourism Organization, a branch of the UN. Dozens of Brazilian women have been finding this out the hard way, after paying for luxury holidays from a man whose Instagram account sparkles with opulent hotels and exotic locations.Last December Maria (not her real name) decided to have a break from the heat of the Australian summer, and to take her family on a skiing holiday to Europe.It was her first trip since the pandemic and she wanted it to be special. So she paid $20,000 to a travel agent, Rafael Bessa, a fellow Brazilian who had been recommended by a friend, and made the long flight north.To begin with, everything was perfect, but as Maria checked out of the third hotel the manager told her the room had not been paid for.Two further shocks came in quick succession. When Maria contacted Rafael Bessa to ask for help, she noticed he was unable to talk to the hotel manager in French, despite his claim to have attended an exclusive boarding school in the Alps. Then, when the family boarded a train to their next destination, there was a problem with the tickets: he had provided two tickets with the same purchase number, meaning that only one was valid.At the next hotel it was a similar story: Maria had to settle the bill, even though she had paid in full already.Initially she had assumed Rafael Bessa was simply incompetent. \"Then I said, 'No, this is not a mistake, this is on purpose. This is in bad faith.'\"Altogether, Maria says she lost $30,000 on the holiday - $15,000 of the money she had paid in advance, plus an extra $15,000 for just one of the hotels. Maria says that as well as telling her he'd paid for the room, Rafael Bessa said he'd got her a free upgrade - but he hadn't, and the hotel charged the staggering full price for the super de luxe room.Rafael Bessa's promises of reimbursement came to nothing, Maria says. Although he sent her various \"proofs\" of money transfers, the cash never actually arrived in her account.Then, when she posted about her experiences on social media, she says his lawyer got in touch, offering to reimburse $20,000 as long as she signed a non-disclosure agreement. She refused.The BBC asked Rafael Bessa to comment on Maria's allegations. He replied that there had been an unspecified \"problem\" with the price of one of the hotels, and that the room at this price had not been included in the package. He also sent copies of the train bookings - which, as Maria said, both bore the same purchase number.Another Brazilian woman, Ana Jalenna, booked an Alpine skiing trip and also an Italian summer holiday with Rafael Bessa, after he had organised a \"fantastic\" family holiday for her in Brazil.She paid part of the bill in cash, and the plan was that he would put the rest on her credit card. Some time later, she was surprised to see a payment to British Airways appear on her card account and called him to ask about it.It was the payment for her Italian hotel, he told her. Finding this hard to believe, she emailed the hotel and was told no payment had been made.Ana decided to ask Rafael Bessa for proof that he had at least made the bookings at the ski resort. He gave her two reservation numbers, but the hotel told her they were invalid.\"I lost the money, the dream, the trip. I lost everything,\" she says.She later spoke to other dissatisfied clients of Rafael Bessa's, and noticed a pattern.\"The first trip was fantastic and everything is OK,\" she says. \"And then he does a longer trip, a better trip with expensive hotels, and he does this to people.\"Rafael Bessa insisted to the BBC that he booked the Italian hotel. He said Ana cancelled the skiing trip, and he paid her back the money.But Ana said she didn't cancel it - and wasn't reimbursed.Social media is tempting people to sample the luxury holiday lifestyle, but what happens when it all goes wrong? This is the story of one Brazilian travel agent with a trail of unhappy clients around the world.Maria and Ana were angry and scarred by their experience, but neither suffered financial hardship as a result.For Adriane Trofin, a Brazilian working mother of two who lives in London, the failure of her dream family holiday to Greece this year was more traumatic.She first came across Rafael Bessa on Facebook, captivated by his posts from beautiful locations, and struck up an online friendship.She explained that she couldn't afford that kind of holiday herself, but he replied that there were trips for every budget, and she ended up booking a dream holiday to Greece for 14 people in total - members of her family and a number of friends.They had paid Rafael Bessa in advance for the stay at a four-star Club Med resort, but the cars that should have met them at Athens airport didn't arrive.Adriane messaged Rafael Bessa for help. He reassured her that everything had been booked, and gave her three telephone numbers for the car company, but she couldn't get through on any of them.The group was stranded for hours. Eventually, the airport operations manager for Club Med, David Doepfer, came to their assistance. He quickly established that there was no Club Med booking in Adriane's name. Rafael Bessa had once reserved rooms, he learned, but had not paid for them before the expiry date.David called the travel agent and asked him to book a different hotel in Athens for the group, which he agreed to do. But David says that when he called the new hotel to check Rafael Bessa had stuck to his word he was told the rooms had not been paid for.This video can not be playedAdriane Trofin says her marriage is still badly shakenIn the end Adriane's husband paid for the entire group to stay in another hotel, at a cost of $8,500.\"I spent that week, those seven days, discussing with Rafael day and night on the phone, trying to make him send at least a part of the money. He started to mock me,\" Adriane says. He also harassed other members of the group, she says, convincing some of them that the problem was Adriane's fault and that she owed him money.\"I was in hell. I had never faced a worse situation in my life, I never had anything worse in my life than those seven days in Greece.\"My marriage is still badly shaken by that. For me, it's a lot of money, you see? But it's no longer just about the money.\"She says the experience left her \"emotionally destroyed\".Despite having assured Adriane, as she waited at the airport, that everything would be fine, Rafael Bessa told the BBC he had cancelled the hotel booking because Adriane had failed to pay everything she owed him.But Adriane showed the BBC evidence of money transfers made before the trip covering the full cost of the hotel. She had agreed with Rafael Bessa to pay for three plane tickets in instalments, and was up to date with these payments - which Mr Bessa confirmed in screengrabs of messages he sent to the BBC.The BBC has spoken to 10 other clients of Rafael Bessa. Together with Maria, Ana and Adriane they say they paid him $90,000 for services that were not provided.We also spoke to Brazilian lawyer Victor Penido Machado, who is bringing a case against Rafael Bessa on behalf of nearly 50 clients. They paid a total of $183,000 for hotel bookings and other services that were not delivered, he says.A similar pattern is repeated again and again, the lawyer says. Clients arrive at their destinations, find a hotel has not been paid for, and are unable to get Rafael Bessa to pay them back.Approached by the BBC, Mr Bessa denied the allegations made by his former clients, saying he was \"shocked\".\"I'm really surprised by the amount of errors, 90% of your facts are false,\" he wrote.The UN's World Tourism Organization (UNWTO) says social media is increasingly being used by travel agents to persuade customers to buy a dream holiday - one that they too can look forward to posting on social media.\"Because they are being displayed on social media, tourists may have the perception that these services are more reliable than if they would find them on any regular website,\" says UNWTO legal counsel, Alicia Gomez.At the same time, digital travel scams are on the rise all over the world, Ms Gomez says.\"This has become a global and systemic problem. Many national consumers and authorities are reporting an increase in online scams, and the number may be even higher as the shame and the guilt of tourists that fall for them discourage reporting.\"The UNWTO has developed a code for the protection of tourists, which it says clarifies the responsibilities of social media companies, governments and consumers and describes how governments and private companies can best work together.Seven countries have signed up to the code so far, making it part of their national legislation, while others, including Brazil, are in the process of doing so.Meta, owner of Instagram and Facebook, told the BBC: \"We don't allow fraudulent activity on our platforms and work closely with law enforcement to support investigations and keep scammers out.\"We continue to invest in new technologies and spent approximately $5bn last year alone on safety and security.\""

        "text": "An outcast from birth, Milton Washington is the child of a Korean woman and a black US soldier, who became a \"slickyboy\", or child thief, and dreamed of making it to America. At the age of eight, he seized his chance.When a beautiful car pulled up one day outside St Vincent's orphanage in South Korea, Milton Washington made a split-second decision that would change the course of his life.A black American couple stepped out. The man was in military uniform, the woman had an Afro and wore a beautiful flowing dress, and when Milton realised that they were going to adopt his friend Joseph - who was black and Korean just like him - he ran to the couple's car, jumped inside and locked all the doors.Crying and screaming for his life, he wasn't getting out unless the man and woman took him home with them too.The couple - Captain and Mrs Washington - agreed to take both Joseph and Milton home, but only to see which of them fitted in best with their family. They would give it a few days, they said, and then make their choice.That night, lying in bed in an unfamiliar bedroom, in an unfamiliar house at the Dongducheon American military base, little Milton made his second big decision of the day - and ran away.\"I didn't want to get taken back to the orphanage - maybe they wouldn't choose me,\" he says.\"I was just trying to get to America.\"Before his life in the orphanage, Milton was the only black child in a small village near the border with North Korea. Milton's father, an American soldier, was long gone, but his mother, who worked hard days in the rice fields, loved him and protected him fiercely against the prejudice they encountered.The children in Milton's South Korean village would sing a song about red apples, bananas, a train - and a monkey. \"I remember the part of the song they sang to me the loudest. The part about the black monkey's butt being red. That set the tone,\" he says. It was just an innocent playground song on the face of it - it wasn't racist, or at least, not designed to be. But they turned it into something hurtful: a way to single him out for the colour of his skin.As the son of a black man, he says, he fell \"outside of the limits\" of what it meant to be Korean in the '60s and '70s. And because his father was not Korean, he had no right to a birth certificate.Milton knew that his father was from the US - in his mind a land of flying cars, where the cities were made of gold, with ice-cream mountains.\"I dreamed of going to America because it was full of black people - these magical creatures,\" Milton says, \"and of being accepted.\"Milton's America was a fantasy land that couldn't have been more different from his reality. He and his mother lived in a mud and stone hut, slept on the floor, and washed their clothes in the river.One morning, village elders arrived at the door and told Milton's mother they would no longer accept \"the shame that you're bringing upon this village because of that boy\". Although Milton's mother argued their case, she and Milton left their home and moved to a nearby town attached to an American military base. There were cars there, electricity, and money, all of which were new to Milton - salt had been the currency in their village.Milton also saw black American soldiers for the first time, and felt a step closer to finding his father.Milton Washington spoke toon BBC World ServiceIn the alleys of the red-light district below their tiny apartment, homeless boys begged, picked pockets, and fought with other gangs. The American soldiers called them \"slickyboys\" - slang for little thieves. And when six-year-old Milton shared a packet of Oreos with the boys - given to him by his mum's American boyfriend - he became a slickyboy too. Milton finally felt like he belonged.\"All the black soldiers would give me money - dollar bills, not just change,\" he says. \"It completely changed my life.\"Milton's mother had become a sex worker in a club in town and went out at night to work. Milton was left alone in their apartment - under strict instruction not to leave, instructions he routinely ignored.One night Milton's mum didn't return from work as expected - the club had been raided by the police and she and all the other women who worked there were sent to jail for two weeks.Free of his mother's rules, Milton and his friends ran wild, stealing drinks from bars and having adventures all over town.When his mum returned, she made sure Milton was never left alone again. Each time she got wind of a police raid, she would drop Milton at an orphanage for a couple of weeks so that he was safe.Milton remembers being racially abused by the other, mostly Korean, kids at these orphanages, as he had been in the village growing up. But this time, he didn't let it get to him.\"I would almost laugh it off,\" he says. \"'Yeah, I may be these racial slurs that you're talking about - but you're the orphan. I have a mother, she says she's going to be back in two weeks.' And she was always back in two weeks.\"For a while, this routine continued. Then one morning, Milton and his mum took a taxi to a different orphanage, where many of the children looked like Milton. It was an orphanage for children born to American servicemen and Korean mothers, called the St Vincent's home for Amerasian children.Milton's mum assured him she'd be back the following day and promised him a present - he asked for a train set. But when she returned there was no train set, just a hug that he didn't know meant goodbye.\"She told me, 'I need you to be strong,'\" he says. \"That was the last time I saw her.\"It wasn't long after Milton first arrived at St Vincent's orphanage that Captain and Mrs Washington took him to their home on a military base - from where he decided to run away.He didn't get far. He was still small and the compound fences were high, and a search party found him, hours later, sound asleep in a children's playground.But the incident shook the Washingtons, who decided that both Milton and Joseph could stay with them permanently. The boys were adopted in 1977 and eventually moved to America - becoming part of a noisy, loving family of six children, who rode bikes, played sports, and went to school - all the normal childhood things Milton had longed for.But he worried about what had become of his mother and would cry himself to sleep. He was haunted by dreams of wading through paddy fields looking for her. She had always been his \"island of refuge in a very tough world\", he says.Now in his 50s - he's not sure of his exact age - Milton works as a photographer in New York and is writing a memoir called \"Slickyboy\". He's always remained curious about his biological family, and in recent years began to look for connections via DNA websites. In April 2019, he got a hit. It was a family member on his mother's side, who wanted to speak to him immediately.\"Hello, I'm calling from Seattle,\" the voice - with a strong Korean accent - said.\"This is Milton-ah (little Milton),\" he said, using the name his birth mother had often called him.\"I am your sister, Tong, do you remember me?\"Milton did remember meeting Tong - she was one of his older sisters, and they had met a handful of times in Korea when Milton was a little boy. Tong had lived with their grandparents, from whom Milton's mother was estranged.Speaking to his half-sister, Milton says, was \"an incredible moment\".\"I was just really excited [to be] connected with my past, and to have my memories validated by her.\"Milton had not expected his mother to survive, but Tong told him she'd lived a long life, and had died just a few years previously. His mother and sisters had come to the US in 1998, and though they knew that Milton was living there too, Milton's mum had felt she had no right to contact him.But she had left a keepsake for Milton with Tong - a gold and jade necklace to remember her by.\"It's a beautiful piece,\" he says. \"It's a way to carry my mother with me.\"Milton keeps searching for answers about his father. He believes his dad likely came from Louisiana, but has little more information.\"I want to know what kind of man he is. He's the only missing link,\" Milton says.Despite the sadness he still sometimes feels, Milton is certain his mum made the right decision giving him up all those years ago.\"She knew that if I had a shot at an American life, I would do well at it. I love her for that act,\" he says.\"There is a hole in my heart that's always going to be there. But the benefits of my current life versus what it could have been - there's no argument there.\""

        "name": "Charity research finds that only 1% of disability hate crimes end with a charge",
        "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/disability-63171959",
        "text": "Of the thousands of disability hate crimes reported to the police last year, just 1% resulted in criminal charges, two charities have revealed.Leonard Cheshire and United Response submitted Freedom of Information requests to 43 police forces in England and Wales and 36 responded.It found that out of more than 11,000 reports, 99% of cases went no further.The National Police Chiefs' Council said it wanted \"to understand the reasons\" behind the low number.A hate crime is an offence which targets a victim's protected characteristics, including their race, religion, sexual orientation or disability.PhD student, Cassie Lovelock from London, told theshe has experienced physical and verbal abuse because of her disability many times.She has hereditary neuropathy with a liability for pressure palsies (HNPP), a rare condition with similar symptoms to MS, and often uses a wheelchair.On one occasion, while waiting for her boyfriend outside a shop, two drunk men grabbed her wheelchair and pushed her down the road while making sexual comments.Despite screaming for help, she claims passers-by ignored her. She eventually escaped by rolling her wheelchair into the road., Cassie talks more about her experiences of disability hate crime and the team look at the support available.And a month into Prime Minister Liz Truss's premiership there's still no confirmation about who the new Minister of State for Disabled People will be\u2026or is there?On another occasion, Cassie was pushed out of her wheelchair by a woman who wanted to use the wheelchair space on a London bus for her pushchair.\"It was very humiliating,\" Cassie says. The bus driver witnessed the incident, helped Cassie and refused to let the other woman travel.Cassie says the incidents she has endured - including being shouted at on the street and accused of faking her disability - have all been \"intrinsically tied\" to her disability.But, she admits, she hasn't always reported her experiences immediately because she wasn't sure they would be considered hate crimes.Ali Gunn, policy lead for United Response, which was involved in the research, says Cassie's experience is common.\"A lot of the time victims don't even know they've been a victim of a disability hate crime\" and, as a result, the number of reported incidents could be the \"tip of the iceberg\".She says a disability hate crime is classed as \"any criminal offence that is motivated by a person's disability or perceived disability\".Of those hate crimes that were reported but went no further, Ali says: \"We found that around 50% of the no-charge outcomes were a result of either the victim withdrawing support, evidential difficulties despite there being a named suspect, or that the police were unable to find a suspect.\"She says its \"really important for the victim to capture as much information as possible - what they hear, what they see, or what's happening and the date, the time, the location\".But she adds that the whole community should play its part.\"If you witness a crime you might feel uncomfortable or nervous to go up at the time, but afterwards please support the victim. Give your phone number, give any information that you were able to record at that point in time about what happened.\"The two charities - Leonard Cheshire and United Response - which conducted the research have called for police forces to appoint Disability Liaison Officers.\"They would be able to support a disabled victim from the point of reporting all the way through,\" Ali says, hopefully resulting in a higher charge rate.This week, the Home Office also released its statistics on hate crimes. It reported that 14,242 disability hate crimes had been recorded in the year ending March 2022 - an increase of 43% on the previous year.That figure has doubled since 2017/2018 with stalking and harassment offences the most commonly recorded disability hate crimes.A Home Office spokesperson described hate crime as a \"scourge on communities\" and said that \"while the rise is likely to be largely driven by improvements in police recording, we cannot be complacent.\"They added: \"[We] expect the police to fully investigate these hateful attacks and make sure the cowards who commit them feel the full force of the law.\"After thinking about the incident with the men, Cassie did report it to the police. She received a call from an officer and a case number, but says she never heard from them again, putting Cassie's case in the 99% that result in no charge. The force was unable to corroborate this information.Cassie is getting on with her PhD, but says the \"terrifying\" experiences have stayed with her and she has changed where she shops and which public transport she uses as a result.\"Even now, I get this anxiety - what if something happens?\" she says..Hate crimes recorded by police rise by 26%United ResponseLeonard Cheshire"

        "name": "TikTok profits from livestreams of families begging",
        "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/world-63213567",
        "text": "This video can not be playedWATCH: Mona Ali Al-Karim says she and her daughters beg for money to pay for hospital treatmentDisplaced families in Syrian camps are begging for donations on TikTok while the company takes up to 70% of the proceeds, a BBC investigation found.Children are livestreaming on the social media app for hours, pleading for digital gifts with a cash value.The BBC saw streams earning up to $1,000 (\u00a3900) an hour, but found the people in the camps received only a tiny fraction of that.TikTok said it would take prompt action against \"exploitative begging\".The company said this type of content was not allowed on its platform, and it said its commission from digital gifts was significantly less than 70%. But it declined to confirm the exact amount.Earlier this year, TikTok users saw their feeds fill with livestreams of families in Syrian camps, drawing support from some viewers and concerns about scams from others.In the camps in north-west Syria, the BBC found that the trend was being facilitated by so-called \"TikTok middlemen\", who provided families with the phones and equipment to go live.The middlemen said they worked with agencies affiliated to TikTok in China and the Middle East, who gave the families access to TikTok accounts. These agencies are part of TikTok's global strategy to recruit livestreamers and encourage users to spend more time on the app.Since the TikTok algorithm suggests content based on the geographic origin of a user's phone number, the middlemen said they prefer to use British SIM cards. They say people from the UK are the most generous gifters.Mona Ali Al-Karim and her six daughters are among the families who go live on TikTok every day, sitting on the floor of their tent for hours, repeating the few English phrases they know: \"Please like, please share, please gift.\"Mona's husband was killed in an airstrike and she is using the livestreams to raise money for an operation for her daughter Sharifa, who is blind.The gifts they're asking for are virtual, but they cost the viewers real money and can be withdrawn from the app as cash. Livestream viewers send the gifts - ranging from digital roses, costing a few cents, to virtual lions costing around $500 - to reward or tip creators for content.For five months, the BBC followed 30 TikTok accounts broadcasting live from Syrian camps for displaced people and built a computer program to scrape information from them, showing that viewers were often donating digital gifts worth up to $1,000 an hour to each account.Families in the camps said they were receiving only a tiny fraction of these sums, however.With TikTok declining to say how much it takes from gifts, the BBC ran an experiment to track where the money goes.A reporter in Syria contacted one of the TikTok-affiliated agencies saying he was living in the camps. He obtained an account and went live, while BBC staff in London sent TikTok gifts worth $106 from another account.At the end of the livestream, the balance of the Syrian test account was $33. TikTok had taken 69% of the value of the gifts.TikTok influencer and ex-professional rugby player Keith Mason donated \u00a3300 ($330) during one family's livestream and encouraged his nearly one million followers to do the same.When told by the BBC that most of these funds were taken by the social media company, he said it was \"ridiculous\" and \"unfair\" to families in Syria.\"You've got to have some transparency. To me, that's very greedy. It's greed,\" he said.The $33 remaining from the BBC's $106 gift was reduced by a further 10% when it was withdrawn from the local money transfer shop. TikTok middlemen would take 35% of the remainder, leaving a family with just $19.Hamid, one of the TikTok middlemen in the camps, told the BBC he had sold his livestock to pay for a mobile phone, SIM card and wi-fi connection to work with families on TikTok.He now broadcasts with 12 different families, for several hours a day.Hamid said he uses TikTok to help families make a living. He pays them most of the profits, minus his running costs, he said.Like the other middlemen, Hamid said he was supported by \"live agencies\" in China, who work directly with TikTok.\"They help us if we have any problems with the app. They unlock blocked accounts. We give them the name of the page, the profile picture, and they open the account,\" Hamid said.This video can not be playedHamid helps families go on TikTok live. Watch how the BBC investigated TikTok's commission from digital giftsAgencies like these, known as \"livestreaming guilds\" and based all around the world, are contracted by TikTok to help content creators produce more appealing livestreams.TikTok pays them a commission according to the duration of livestreams and the value of gifts received, the agencies told the BBC.The emphasis on duration means TikTokers, including children in the Syrian camps, go live for hours at a time.Marwa Fatafta, from digital rights organisation Access Now, says these livestreams run contrary to TikTok's own policies to \"prevent the harm, endangerment or exploitation\" of minors on the platform.BBC News investigates a new trend on TikTok - hundreds of families in camps for displaced people in Syria, begging for gifts on TikTok livestreams.\"TikTok clearly states that users are not allowed to explicitly solicit gifts, so this is a clear violation of their own terms of services, as well as the rights of these people,\" she said.She acknowledges that people have the right to share their stories online \"to try to seek support and sympathy\", but she says these livestreams \"lack dignity, and are humiliating\".TikTok's rules say you must have 1,000 followers before you can go live, you must not directly solicit for gifts and must \"prevent the harm, endangerment or exploitation\" of minors on the platform.But when the BBC used the in-app system to report 30 accounts featuring children begging, TikTok said there had been no violation of its policies in any of the cases.After the BBC contacted TikTok directly for comment, the company banned all of the accounts.It said in a statement: \"We are deeply concerned by the information and allegations brought to us by the BBC, and have taken prompt and rigorous action.\"This type of content is not allowed on our platform, and we are further strengthening our global policies around exploitative begging.\"TikTok, the world's fastest-growing social media app, has made more than $6.2bn in gross revenue from in-app spending since its launch in 2017, according to analytics company Sensor Tower.The BBC approached several charities working in Syria to support families in the camps as an alternative to making money on TikTok Live.A local charity Takaful Alsham said it would provide basic supplies to the families for the next three months, helping the children find schools and covering their educational expenses.But for many in the camps, there are few options to make money other than begging online. Hundreds of families continue to go live every day, and most of the money donated is still going to TikTok."

        "name": "Deepfaked: \u2018They put my face on a porn video\u2019",
        "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-62821117",
        "text": "Imagine if your face had been digitally edited into a porn video without your consent and then shared on the internet. One woman reveals the horror of it happening to her.Scrolling through her Twitter feed one evening, Kate Isaacs stumbled across a disturbing video among her notifications.\"This panic just washed over me,\" Kate says, speaking publicly for the first time about what happened. \"Someone had taken my face, put it on to a porn video, and made it look like it was me.\"Kate had been deepfaked. Someone had used artificial intelligence to digitally manipulate her face onto someone else's - in this case a porn actress.The deepfake video on Twitter - with Kate, who campaigns against non-consensual porn, tagged - had been made using footage from TV interviews she had given while campaigning. It appeared to show her having sex.\"My heart sank. I couldn't think clearly,\" she says. \"I remember just feeling like this video was going to go everywhere - it was horrendous.\"In the past, high-profile celebrities and politicians were the most common targets of deepfakes - the videos weren't always porn, some were made for comedic value. But over the years that's changed - according to cybersecurity company Deeptrace, 96% of all deepfakes are non-consensual porn.Like revenge porn, deepfake pornography is what's known as image-based sexual abuse - an umbrella term which encompasses the taking, making and/or sharing of intimate images without consent.It is already an offence in Scotland to share images or videos that show another person in an intimate situation without their consent. But in other parts of the UK, it's only an offence if it can be proved that such actions were intended to cause the victim distress - a loophole which means video creators often don't face legal consequences.Government plans for a long-awaited UK-wide Online Safety Bill have been under endless revision and repeatedly shelved. The new laws would give the regulator, Ofcom, the power to take action against any website deemed to be enabling harm to UK users, no matter where they are based in the world. Earlier this month, however,she and her team were now \"working flat out\" to ensure the bill was delivered.Kate, 30, founded the #NotYourPorn campaign in 2019. A year later, her activism contributed to the adult entertainment website, Pornhub, having to- the majority of its content.Kate therefore assumed that whoever was behind the deepfake of her had been annoyed by her campaigning. She had \"taken away their porn\".But she had no idea who that person was, or who might have seen the video. And while she could see that her face had been overlaid onto footage of a porn actor, the video was convincing enough that she worried others might not spot the deception.\"It was a violation - my identity was used in a way I didn't consent to.\"Underneath the video, people began leaving streams of abusive comments, saying they were going to follow Kate home, rape her, film the attack, and publish the footage on the internet.\"You start thinking about your family,\" she says, holding back tears. \"How would they feel if they saw this content?\"The threat intensified when both Kate's home and work addresses were published below the video - a practice known as doxing.\"I became completely paranoid - 'Who knows my address? Is it someone I know that's done this?'\"I was thinking, 'I'm really in trouble here, this isn't just some people on the internet mouthing off, there's actually a real danger.'\"From her experience supporting others in similar situations, Kate knew exactly what to do if someone becomes a victim - but in that moment she froze.\"I didn't follow any of my own advice,\" she says. \"Kate the campaigner was very strong and didn't show any vulnerability - and then there was me, Kate, who was really scared.\"A colleague reported the video, vicious comments and doxing to Twitter, and they were all taken down from the platform. But once any deepfake has been published and shared online it's difficult to remove it from circulation entirely.\"I just wanted that video off the internet,\" Kate says, \"but there was nothing I could do about it.\"There's a marketplace for deepfakes in online forums. People post requests for videos to be made of their wives, neighbours and co-workers and - unfathomable as it might seem - even their mothers, daughters and cousins.Content creators respond with step-by-step instructions - what source material they'll need, advice on which filming angles work best, and price tags for the work.A deepfake content creator based in south-east England, Gorkem, spoke to the BBC anonymously. He began creating celebrity deepfakes for his own gratification - he says they allow people to \"realise their fantasies in ways that really wasn't [sic] possible before\".Later, Gorkem moved on to deepfaking women he was attracted to, including colleagues at his day job who he barely knew.Harmless images are being turned into hardcore porn and used to harass women. Jess Davies explores the emotional and psychological toll being \"deepfaked\" has on unsuspecting victims.\"One was married, the other in a relationship,\" he says. \"Walking into work after having deepfaked these women - it did feel odd, but I just controlled my nerves. I can act like nothing's wrong - no-one would suspect.\"Realising he could make money from what he refers to as his \"hobby\", Gorkem started taking commissions for custom deepfakes. Gathering footage from women's social media profiles provides him with plenty of source material. He says he even recently deepfaked a woman using a Zoom call recording.\"With a good amount of video, looking straight at the camera, that's good data for me. Then the algorithm can just extrapolate from that and make a good reconstruction of the face on the destination video.\"He accepts \"some women\" could be psychologically harmed by being deepfaked, but seems indifferent about the potential impact of the way he is objectifying them.\"They can just say, 'It's not me - this has been faked.' They should just recognise that and get on with their day.\"From a moral standpoint I don't think there's anything that would stop me,\" he says. \"If I'm going to make money from a commission I would do it, it's a no brainer.\"The standard of deepfakes can vary wildly, and depends both on the expertise of the person who made the video and the sophistication of the technology used.But the man behind the largest deepfake porn website admits it's no longer easy to know for certain whether you're looking at manipulated images or not. His site attracts about 13 million visitors a month and hosts roughly 20,000 videos at any one time. He is based in the US and rarely speaks to the media - but he agreed to talk to the BBC anonymously.Deepfaking \"ordinary\" women is a red line for him, he says, but in his view,  hosting pornographic deepfake videos of celebrities, social media influencers and politicians, is justifiable.\"They're accustomed to negative media, their content is available in the mainstream. They're different to normal citizens,\" he says.\"The way I see it, they are able to deal with it in a different way - they can just brush it off. I don't really feel consent is required - it's a fantasy, it's not real.\"Does he think what he's doing is wrong? Part of him is \"in denial about the impact on women\", he admits - and notably, he reveals that his spouse doesn't know what he does for a living.\"I haven't told my wife. I'm afraid of how it might affect her.\"Until relatively recently, deepfake software wasn't easily available, and the average person wouldn't have had the skills to make them. But now, anyone over the age of 12 can legally download dozens of apps and make convincing deepfakes in a few clicks.For Kate that's worrying and \"really scary\".\"It's not the dark web, it's in the app stores - right in front of our faces.\"She also fears the hoped-for Online Safety Bill won't keep up with technology. Three years ago, when the bill was first drafted, deepfake creation was seen as a professional skill in which someone would need to be trained - not merely download an app.\"We're years down the line and the contents of [the bill] are out of date - there's so much missing,\" she says.But for creator Gorkem, criminalising deepfaking would change things.\"If I could be traced online I would stop there and probably find another hobby,\" he says.Being deepfaked and doxed had an impact on Kate's health and her ability to trust other people. She believes those behind the attacks weren't only trying to intimidate and humiliate her, but also to silence her. For a time, she stepped back from campaigning, questioning whether she could carry on speaking out about misogyny.But now, she is all the more fired-up. She realised she cared too much to walk away.\"I'm not letting them win.\"Deepfakes can be used to control women, and tech firms - including those who make apps that enable face-swapping - should be encouraged to put safeguards in place, she says.\"Any app should be able to detect sexual content.\"\"If companies have not put money, resources and time into ensuring their app isn't being used as a place to create sexual abuse content, they are being deliberately irresponsible. They are culpable.\"Source: #NotYourPorn Campaign"

        "name": "'Claims I had sexsomnia destroyed my rape case'",
        "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-63116989",
        "text": "Jade McCrossen-Nethercott's rape case was dropped by the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) because of claims she had an episode of a rare sleep condition called \"sexsomnia\". As a result, the CPS no longer believed they could secure a conviction. But Jade challenged the decision and spent months reinvestigating.The CPS now admit they were wrong not to take it to trial and have apologised unreservedly to her.But what went wrong? The BBC followed Jade's case as events unfolded.It was a Sunday evening in the spring of 2017 when Jade woke up on a sofa in south London to discover she was half-naked, with her necklace lying broken on the floor.The 24-year-old, originally from St Ives in Cornwall, had the intense feeling she had been penetrated and thought she had been raped while she slept.Three years later - and just days before the man charged with raping her was due to stand trial - lawyers from the CPS called her to an urgent meeting at a police station.Her case was being dropped. The CPS lawyer explained that two sleep experts had given their opinions on her case. They said it was possible Jade had had an episode of sexsomnia and could have appeared to have been awake and consenting.Sexsomnia is a medically-recognised sleep disorder. People with the condition perform sexual acts in their sleep.This video can not be playedJade was allowed to record the CPS meeting where she was told there would not be a trialA person is deemed not to have consented to sex if they are asleep, according to the law in England and Wales. However, it also states that a person is not guilty of rape if they had \"reasonable belief\" in consent.\"It came completely out of the blue, and it was baffling,\" says Jade, who had never heard of sexsomnia until then.\"I've had two long-term relationships spanning 13 years, and I've never had anything like this.\"\u200b\u200bThe decision by the CPS meant they would close the case and the defendant would be formally acquitted.The first time Jade had been asked about her sleep, was in the police station when she went to give a formal statement.In response to a question from a police officer, she explained that she had always been a deep sleeper and had sleepwalked a couple of times as a teenager.It was a passing comment, forgotten about in the whole gruelling process until her case was dropped.It had been Jade's best friend Bel who had dialled 999 and started the whole police process.She remembers the sound of Jade's voice on the other end of the line. \"It was like nothing I've ever heard before. She was hysterical and sobbing, and she said 'I think I've been raped.' When your best friend says that to you, it's just earth-shattering.\"The two had been out the evening before at a bar in south London. They had got ready together, drinking prosecco as they did their makeup and headed out arm-in-arm.It was a fun evening, drinking and chatting. When closing time came, Bel ordered a taxi home. Jade decided to go back to a friend's flat with a few people for a last drink.At around 02:00, with people still chatting around her in the living room, she curled up under a blanket in the corner of the sofa, fully-clothed, and fell asleep.At 05:00 she says she woke up to find her trousers and pants were off and her bra was undone. She says she saw a man on the other side of the sofa she was lying on.\"I confronted him saying, 'What's happened? What have you done?' And he said something a bit odd I guess, but he did say 'I thought you were awake.'\"And he just bolted out basically, and left the door open. And I got my phone and started calling Bel\u2026\"Two male police officers arrived and took Jade straight for forensic tests. Vaginal swabs detected semen which would later be matched to the man on the sofa.The suspect offered no comment when initially questioned by police. The CPS made the decision to charge him with rape. He pleaded not guilty. A date was set for trial.But it never went ahead.Jade was determined to prove the CPS were wrong to drop her case, but she had limited time to appeal.She requested all the evidence - including police interviews, toxicology results, witness statements and the sleep experts' reports - and pored over them.She was shocked by what she read - and in particular the weight given to the sleep experts' theories.When unexpected sleepwalking claims turn a rape case on its head, Jade fights back. Filmed over three years, this is the remarkable story of one woman's battle for justice. Will she win?Neither expert had met her in person, but their opinions had been significant enough to close her case.The first expert, who had been instructed by the defence, concluded there was a \"strong possibility\" that Jade had an attack of sexsomnia, saying \"her behaviour would have been of someone actively engaging in sexual activity with eyes open and showing pleasure\".The CPS then hired their own expert in response. He concluded that \"a history of sleepwalking, even once at the age of 16 years, and ongoing sleep talking or any family history, is entirely adequate to establish a predisposition to sexsomnia\".Jade was speechless. \"I don't see how this can be one isolated incident [of sexsomnia], that just so happens to be the time that somebody I would never have consented to have sex with had sex with me,\" she says.Jade decided to pay for her own expert opinion and approached Dr Irshaad Ebrahim at the London Sleep Centre. He also has experience of giving expert opinions in rape cases.Jade's case was the first he had seen where a complainant victim was purported to have sexsomnia. In all the other rape cases he had encountered, it was the defendant claiming to have had an attack of sexsomnia. The BBC carried out extensive research and could not find any other UK rape case where the defence had argued the complainant had sexsomnia.Dr Ebrahim explained there was limited scientific research and no precise way of diagnosing sexsomnia. But he said people he sees with the disorder are typically male and tend to have a history of the sexual behaviour in their sleep.Jade then underwent a sleep test - a polysomnography, which monitors brainwaves, breathing and movement during sleep.This video can not be playedPolice bodycam footage when officers first spoke to JadeThe test indicated that she snores and has mild sleep apnea, a common condition where breathing stops and starts during sleep. Both were, according to Dr Ebrahim, potential trigger factors for sexsomnia, so he could not rule out that she may have had an isolated episode.Jade wanted to know if he could give her a clear idea of what the chances were that sexsomnia had been to blame for what happened.\"That is the billion dollar question,\" said Dr Ebrahim.\"Wanting a definitive, black and white answer - yes it was or no it wasn't - is not going to happen.\"Jade still believed she didn't have sexsomnia - but was frustrated the sleep experts couldn't rule it out.She turned to a lawyer to find out more about how courts treat the disorder as a defence.Barrister Allison Summers KC has defended in rape cases where the man accused has claimed to have sexsomnia.She told Jade that sleep experts are almost never able to say definitively whether someone has the condition - but saying \"it's possible\" could be enough for a jury to reach a not guilty verdict.\"Do I think, as a result of that, that some guilty people get off or are acquitted? Yes, I do. But I generally come back to the point that I would rather that be the case, than we're convicting people of serious offences that are genuinely not guilty,\" she said.\"The only thing I can say is that you hope the criminal trial process will enable those genuine cases to be pulled out from those less genuine.\"Sexsomnia and other sleepwalking defences should always be robustly challenged in court, according to the CPS guidelines.But Jade's case never made it to court. Armed with her research, she submitted her appeal, known as a victim's right to review.A chief crown prosecutor, independent of the CPS department which made the original decision to close the case, reviewed all the evidence again.He concluded the case should have gone to trial - and that the sleep experts' opinions, and the defendant's account, should have been challenged in court.A jury would have been \"more likely than not\" to convict the defendant, he said - one of the tests a case must meet for the CPS to take it to trial.\"I cannot begin to imagine what you have been through and how you feel. I noted during my review the devastating effect of this case on you,\" he wrote to Jade.\"I apologise unreservedly for this on behalf of the Crown Prosecution Service although I appreciate that is likely to be of little consolation to you.\"If you have been affected by any of the issues raised in this article,For Jade, the acknowledgement that her case should have been put to a jury was bittersweet - because the CPS cannot reopen the case.The defendant was found officially not guilty - and so double jeopardy laws mean he cannot be tried without compelling new evidence.\"There is no hope of any justice for what happened to me,\" says Jade - but she hopes the CPS will learn lessons to prevent others from going through similar ordeals.\"It's just being let down by a system that's there to protect - and they've openly said they messed up,\" she says.In the year to September 2021, just 1.3% of rape cases recorded by police in England and Wales resulted in a suspect being prosecuted, according to Home Office figures.The CPS say they are \"committed to improving every aspect of how life-changing crimes like rape are dealt with and are working closely with the police to transform how they are handled.\"Jade is now suing the CPS for damages."

When you are in a crisis like this, it is really quite simple: it's drinking water and nothing else.\"Climate change is here and now.  We need to get out of our culture of abundance.  We need to show far more restraint in how we use the resources we have.\"Warning lights have been flashing in France after ainherited from 2022.A wet March has provided a welcome partial relief to farmers by moistening soil ahead of planting but underground water levels remain dangerously low, especially around the Mediterranean.  Only Brittany and Aquitaine in the south-west are in a relatively safe position.The Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es-Orientales will become the fourth district where the drought is officially at \"crisis\" level. More than 40 others - amounting to nearly half the country - are already at \"alert\" or \"vigilance\" levels, presaging even worse shortages than last year.In parts of the district, aquifer levels are so low that experts fear saline seepage from the sea, which would make tap water undrinkable. Low aquifer levels also mean a higher concentration of pollutants, which could likewise severely damage water quality.President Emmanuel Macron last month announced a nationwide water programme, with promises of investment to curb leaks and increase recycling. He also outlined a \"progressive water tariff\" under which consumption above a certain quantity - for example, for swimming pools - would be charged at higher rates.Some 2,000 villages and towns are at risk of losing their water supply this year, according to Mr B\u00e9chu.  Last year, 1,000 municipalities had serious problems, of which some 400 had to be provided with bottles or mobile cisterns.\"The war over water triggered by the fall in stocks is a genuine threat to our national cohesion,\" the minister said.French drought alert after driest winter since 1959Catalonia in grip of worst drought in decades"

        "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-63851215",
        "text": "Qatar's human rights record is under scrutiny as the World Cup takes place in Doha. A lot has been written about the treatment of migrant workers who built the stadiums and hotels, but much less about the foreign maids who work for Qatar's ruling classes. On paper their rights have been strengthened in recent years - but the new rules aren't always followed.I make contact with Gladys (not her real name) late at night, after her employers from the Qatari elite have gone to bed.In a brief online conversation she tells me she works from 8am to 11pm every day. She cleans, helps prepare food and looks after the children.She eats what's left from the family's meals, and says she hasn't had a day off since she started 18 months ago.\"Madam is crazy,\" Gladys, a Filipina woman in her 40s, says about her employer. \"She shouts at me every day.\"Before Qatar won the competition to host the 2022 World Cup, foreign workers were unable to change jobs or leave the country without their employer's permission. It's still like this in most Gulf states.Under scrutiny, Qatar began to introduce reforms, but Amnesty International says these have failed to end a pattern of abuses faced by domestic workers.For example, Gladys's employer has held on to her passport, preventing her from leaving without his consent.But Gladys still feels lucky. At least she has been allowed to keep her phone, she says, unlike some other foreign maids. Also, she is not physically abused. In Qatar, this happens all too often, she says.There is another reason she wants to stay in her current job - she thinks it's unlikely at her age that she will get a better one. She earns 1,500 rials a month (just under \u00a3350) and is able to send it all home to support her family.Joanna Concepcion of Migrante International, a grassroots organisation supporting Filipino overseas workers, says that many keep quiet about bad working conditions because earning money for their families is their overriding priority.But when those in Gulf states do feel confident enough to talk freely, she says, they often mention serious abuse. One woman said her employer would push her head into a toilet basin and deny her food and water when he was angry.By contrast, a maid employed by the ruling royal Al Thani family, says she is treated well - but she has no day off, as all workers now should under the new rules.Smiley and animated, Althea (not her real name) video calls the BBC from the basement of a royal residence. She explains that her employers have given her an iPhone, clothes, jewellery and shoes of a kind she couldn't afford back home in the Philippines.As in Gladys's case, it's the difficulty of earning a living wage at home that has brought her here.As we speak, other Filipino domestic workers, who share a large room in Althea's living quarters, say Hi and join the call.They have their own bedrooms and a shared kitchen. This is important. The maids Althea sees on TikTok and Facebook begging for food, and pleading for someone to rescue them, are not as fortunate.\"I see those videos online all the time, which is why I feel so lucky,\" she says. \"For me, every day feels like a fairy tale.\"Nonetheless, it's hard work in these \"Cinderella palaces\" as she refers to them, with their high ceilings and chandeliers, antiques inlaid with gold, mother-of-pearl table tops, and freshly cut flowers.The day generally begins at 6.30am, when staff prepare breakfast for the family. Althea eats once the family has finished. After clearing away, they clean the rooms and set places for lunch.\"It is light work because there are many of us,\" Althea says.Maids rest in their flats between 3pm and 6pm, then prepare for dinner. Once dinner is over, Althea has finished work, and is free to leave the compound if she wants.The royal family doesn't hold on to her passport. But Althea does work every day, including weekends. She doesn't get the day off that Qatari law is now supposed to guarantee. It's a price she pays for providing her family with vital financial support.Mary Grace Morales, a recruiter in Manila who pairs Filipino staff with VIPs in the Gulf, says working for the palace is an \"enviable\" job.\"The family is generous,\" she says. And, in a comment reflecting the hardships the maids may have faced at home, she adds: \"The girls get fatter while they are in the palace. The family feeds them well.\"But the royals have some very specific requirements, she reveals.\"The girls sent to work for the Qatari royal family are between 24 and 35 and very pretty,\" Ms Morales says.She pauses to look at the screen where I stare back at her from the BBC headquarters in London.\"Prettier than you,\" she says, smiling.She later sends a WhatsApp to apologise, as her children overheard and said she had been rude. I assure her I was not offended - and don't mention that hiring people on the basis of their looks would be illegal in many countries.Joanna Concepcion, of Migrante International, says she hopes Althea's account of working as a royal maid is true, but adds: \"It's unlikely that we can know that for certain while she is still in Qatar and working for such a powerful family.\"Some royal staff have complained after leaving the country. In 2019 three British and American workers - a bodyguard, personal trainer and private tutor - sued the emir's sister, Sheikha al Mayassa bint Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani and her husband, in New York, alleging that they had been made to work long hours without overtime. The couple denied the allegations and settled without any admission of liability.\"Reporting and addressing cases of violence and harassment, lack of occupational safety and health, and lack of decent accommodation can be challenging,\" says International Labour Organization (ILO) regional director for Arab states, Ruba Jaradat.The ILO says it is working with Qatar to implement the new rules guaranteeing a minimum wage, a day off each week, sick leave and overtime payments, although this remains \"a challenge\".Althea, in her royal palace, says she is happy despite the long hours.When she goes to bed she will message one of her siblings or parents in the Philippines. She often feels homesick - a fairytale palace is not home.However, it remains a crucial source of income.\"I could never support my family without this job,\" she says.The BBC asked the Qatari royal family and the Qatari embassy in London to comment, but received no reply.How does Qatar treat foreign workers?'I am very afraid', says Qatari transgender womanFamilies seek answers over Qatar building deaths"

        "text": "This video can not be playedWatch: From an uninvited guest to celebs in the same dress (the horror!), here's the Met's unmissable momentsWe were expecting a large number of tributes to Karl Lagerfeld at Monday's Met Gala in New York. What we weren't expecting was to see quite so many tributes to his cat.For this year's theme, the A-list guests were asked to wear outfits which paid homage to the German fashion designer,Lagerfeld served as the creative director of Chanel from 1983 until his death - and many Met Gala attendees chose to wear classic outfits from the French fashion house in his honour.But others preferred to reference the German designer's beloved cat Choupette, who was as synonymous with Lagerfeld's signature look as his sunglasses and white-haired ponytail.Choupette herself sadly did not attend the event, which is the biggest night in the fashion calendar, but sent her apologies\"Many people invited me to walk the red carpet of the Met Gala in tribute to Daddy [Lagerfeld], but we preferred to stay peacefully and cosy at home,\" said the cat.\"We pay tribute to my Daddy every day since his parting and we are very moved to see one more day dedicated to him.\"Here are 17 of the most eye-catching outfits from this year's Met Gala.When your stage name is Doja Cat, and you're asked to pay tribute to a man who loved his cat, your red carpet look really takes care of itself.The US rapper did not disappoint, wearing a gown which featured cat ears, while sporting facial prosthetics to give herself more cat-like features.Her glittering silver dress was designed by Oscar de la Renta and featured a dramatic ruffled train, which she accessorised with some equally dazzling jewellery.We've all experienced one of those awkward moments where you turn up at work and find you're wearing an identical outfit to one of your colleagues.So we sympathise with Irish actor Barry Keoghan and Nigerian singer Burna Boy, who wore strikingly similar chequered blue Burberry outfits to the Met Gala.To be fair, both of them looked brilliant, and we applaud male stars who shun the standard black tuxedo on a red carpet in favour of a splash of colour.The rapper turned up covered in sparkling silver body paint and Swarovski crystals and wearing a matching metallic thong, in one of the most ambitious and unusual outfits of the night.Upon closer inspection, fans spotted that his bejewelled eye mask also featured beaded whiskers - another likely reference to Lagerfeld's cat.To hammer home the point, when Lil Nas X was interviewed by reporters on the red carpet,and waving his claws.While Ortega wore a bright pink Valentino dress to last year's Met Gala, this time around she went with a distinctly spookier and more gothic vibe.Her dark ensemble fitted the Lagerfeld aesthetic, but also reflected Ortega's starring role in Wednesday, Netflix's hugely successful Addams family spin-off.that playing the character had influenced her personal style. \"I do think that Wednesday changed my taste a lot,\" she said. \"I have a hard time getting her off of me, at least clothing-wise.\"OK, back to the cats.Actor Jared Leto can always be relied upon to deliver some of the craziest looks at the Met Gala - but he really outdid himself this year.The Oscar winner turned up literally dressed as a cat. That's it. There really isn't much more we can say.We're lucky he decided to remove his giant cat head while posing for photographs - or we may never have even known it was him.The hottest rising star in music was making her Met Gala debut this year, so she understandably wanted to remember every moment.Perhaps unaware of the invention of the smartphone, the 23-year-old instead brought her own jewel-encrusted camera to take photos (and complement her custom Balmain outfit).the New York rapper was personally invited to the Met Gala by Anna Wintour, who asked her to attend as a guest of Vogue.The singer and actress looked frankly stunning in her mismatched black-and-white Thom Browne coat, which she later took off to reveal a shuttlecock-shaped sheer dress.\"My first Met Gala was in 2011, and I went with Karl [Lagerfeld]. So this is sort of full circle for us to be honouring him,\"Mon\u00e1e accessorised with a white leather quilted cat bag - yet another reference to Choupette.The outfit which perhaps most explicitly referenced Lagerfeld was worn by actor Jeremy Pope.The Hollywood star lit up the Metropolitan Museum of Art's grand staircase in a huge embroidered Balmain cape emblazoned with the recognisable face of the designer.The 30ft cape featured a hand-drawn illustration of Lagerfeld andby 70 seamstresses, with more than 5,000m of silk chiffon.Despite being famous for hits such as Lazy, singer David Byrne was possibly the only guest who turned up looking ready to do some exercise.The Scottish-born star brought his bicycle with him - but wisely decided to walk it up the red carpet, which we imagine was a relief to the Met's health and safety team.Byrne wore an all-white outfit - which must have got muddy when he presumably had to cycle home - with some brightly-coloured trainers.You may recognise the monochromatic suit, as it's the same one Byrne wore when he performed the theme song to Everything Everywhere All At Once at the Oscars in March.We've all been there. You attempt to change your bedsheets by yourself, lose track of which corner is which, and end up in a right old tangle.Actress Glenn Close arrived at the Met Gala looking as if she was still trying to figure it all out, so decided to bring her entire bedspread with her.Her flowing gown was, in fact, a custom Erdem dress. \"Like any great fashion designer, he has a passion to create something beautiful and distinctive,\" the actress said of the designer.The Australian actresses both paid tribute to Lagerfeld with their choice of gowns and shared their memories of the designer.Kidman wore a pale pink dress adorned with 3,000 silver crystals created by Lagerfeld for a Chanel No. 5 commercial she starred in.\"I'm very grateful to wear it,\"\"He was so much a part of my life, as were his whole team. He was the one really sort of shepherded me\u2026 in terms of my love of fashion.\"Robbie, meanwhile, explained she was the last Chanel ambassador to be handpicked by Lagerfeld. She said it was an \"honour\" to wear a 1993 black Chanel gown which Cindy Crawford first wore on a runway.The US theatre producer may not be a household name, but he has consistently served up interesting looks at the Met Gala.This year, Shiaparelli's designer Daniel Roseberry transformed Roth into a human fan for the evening.Roth explained the outfit was an homage to the signature accessory that Lagerfeld often carried around with him.\"The fan is a form that transforms, has function as well as decoration, and it has inherent movement,\" Roth explained. \"It calls to be to be animated and energised, as an extension of your own body.\"The singer wore a black lace gown, embellished with a floral design by Irish designer Simone Rocha.\"I was inspired by Billie herself, her talent, her world and her powerful femininity,\" Rocha said of creating Eilish's custom look. \"I wanted to celebrate her femininity through fragility and strength.\"The star was accompanied by her brother and musical collaborator Finneas, who went for a more casual outfit, wearing a textured brown trench coat tied at the waist.The British actress wore a strapless white custom Valentino Haute Couture gown, but everyone's attention was firmly on her head.Firstly, because Pugh wore a headpiece that looked like it would come in handy clearing cobwebs from a ceiling.But also because Pugh's appearance confirmed recent rumours she had shaved her hair off for a role in a forthcoming film.\"I've actually had it for about three weeks now,\" she told reporters of her shaved head. \"I thought, what is a better way than to release it at The Met?\"The British singer walked the red carpet with her partner, film director Taika Waititi, wearing a reported $90,000 (\u00a372,000) worth of Buccellati jewellery.It included a pearl bracelet and long diamond extensions which hung off the end of her nails.Waititi wore a gun metal blazer by Prabal Gurung which he wore shirtless and paired with smart white trousers.Kendall Jenner wore a sparkly leotard with long sleeves which efficiently doubled as a train. The whole outfit, including the sparkly towering black boots, was designed by Marc Jacobs.But there was also a reference to Lagerfeld in her outfit - Jenner's high white collar was a nod to those worn by the late fashion designer.Tennis star Serena Williams arrived at the Met Gala with her husband, Alexis Ohanian, andwith her second child.Williams showcased her baby bump in along-sleeved dress with a V-neckline, paired with pearl necklaces.Williams said she was \"so excited when Anna Wintour invited the three of us to the Met Gala\".Hers was not the only pregnancy revealed on the red carpet - model Karlie Kloss also announced she is expecting her second child with husband Joshua Kushner.\"I got a plus one, don't tell anybody,\" Kloss joked in an interview with Vogue on the red carpet. \"You know what, this is also the first time I'm sharing my news, so it's very special.\"Cockroach invades Met Ball... plus more unmissable moments.

        "text": "The cost of dying for those already facing financial pressure is the subject of a new photo exhibition.Terminally-ill patients allowed award-winning photographer Margaret Mitchell to chronicle their final weeks alive.The subjects and their loved ones also recorded their struggles as they navigated money worries and illness.The free exhibition, which has just opened at the University of Glasgow, is the culmination of a four-year study into end-of-life financial pressures.The aim was to allow participants to tell their own story in words and images.Stacey, 39,  lived with a rare hereditary genetic condition called Li-Fraumeni syndrome, which makes a person susceptible to developing cancer. She lived with her partner and her mother in a one-bedroom high-rise flat in Glasgow.Taxi fares for medical treatment were a burden. \"I'm in the health centre for blood Monday, that's \u00a320. Then to get injections Tuesday - \u00a325. Then to see my surgeon on Thursday at the hospital - \u00a320,\" she described.Stacey's partner Joost took unpaid leave from his job to care for Stacey and said they struggled financially.He told BBC Scotland: \"In the last month at home, it was three people in one house and that was crowded.\"Stacey's mum had to sleep in the living room on a couch and we had the bed.\"Stacey died recently.A love for fashion and dress-making allowed Liz to create a haven where she felt comfortable.She knew her own flat was not perfect. Her photographs document the black mould in her bedroom and a leaky ceiling. She knew people might see it as \"cluttered\" but it was home to her.Following a diagnosis of terminal lung cancer, Liz struggled to get support. She was estranged from her family and lived alone. She had a partner but they did not live together as she faced her own health issues.She visited charity, vintage clothes shops and the Mitchell library, partly for warmth but also for conversation.Her religious faith also provided solace. \"I've survived with using the radio. When I can't get to church, I listen to this,\" she explained in handwritten notes.In her final days, faced with reductions in her care package due to staff shortages, she accepted a hospice bed.For army veteran Max, remaining at home for the end of his life was a priority. He had experienced homelessness and struggled with institutions. He wanted to be in his local community with friends and his dog, Lily.\"I prefer being at home. No one wants to be in a hospital. I want to do my own thing,\" he said.His home was unfit for his needs, with four sets of stairs and a bath he could not climb into. He was moved into a hospice by concerned carers but before long Max made \"a great escape\", according to his friends.\"He did a runner from the hospice basically to get back to his dog,\" they recalled.With their help and support from his care team, Max was able to stay at home with Lily until the last week of his life.Having grown up in the city, 64-year-old Margaret attributed her cancer diagnosis to pollution. She had lived on a busy road and worked above a bus station for years.She said: \"We went to school in the peasouper. You were all holding onto each other, it was so thick. You couldn't see anything\".Margaret left home aged 16 and worked throughout her life. Following her diagnosis, her main concern was making sure her teenage daughter was financially taken care of when she was gone.With the help of a hospice social worker, Margaret tried to check which benefits she would be eligible for.  She was upset when she discovered she would not be able to access her pension.\"I've never claimed unemployment benefits, ever. Talking about national insurance stamps, I'm fully booked up. I'm going to lose my old-age pension which I never, ever received\".When 53-year-old Andy arrived at the hospice, he was concerned about naming his estranged family in his admission forms in case they were left burdened with his funeral costs.His diagnosis of throat cancer made it hard for him to communicate. He was very sick and \"simply wanted to die\".Hospice staff were able to help Andy reunite with his family - his daughter and a granddaughter he never knew he had.The photos that Andy contributed to the exhibition show bags of food his daughter brought him in the hospice.Photographer Margaret Mitchell noticed a jar with sticky notes by his bedside. Andy explained that he was writing notes to leave to his granddaughter when he was gone.The Cost of Dying exhibition is the culmination of a four-year University of Glasgow study supported by Marie Curie, calledThrough their Glasgow hospice, Marie Curie recruited participants to share their stories in the exhibition.The charity's head of research and innovation Dr Emma Carduff said: \"Financial hardship should never be a barrier to accessing compassionate end of life care and a dignified end of life experience.\"The majority of stories and images included in this exhibition feature people supported by Marie Curie and highlight the systemic issues faced by those who live in poverty.\"This exhibition, which is the first of its kind, aims to bring these issues to the fore, challenge assumptions and promote action.\"By 2040, it is estimated that up to 10,000 more people than now, will be dying with end-of-life support needs in Scotland.Researcher Dr Naomi Richards said: \"We worked very intimately and closely with our research participants to try to get a  sense of their lives - things that give them meaning and the struggles they are having because they are experiencing financial hardship and deprivation.\"Participants told of struggles with income as they were unable to work. Common themes were costs of travel for medical care, utility bills as they spent more time at home and worries about funeral costs.\"The participants were all given cameras and were asked to document through photographs the things that were important to them and the struggles they were having,\" she said.Professional photographer Margaret Mitchell was also asked to create a body of work reflecting their stories and emotions.\"It was a really challenging project but at the same time that's really rewarding because you feel like you're going to perhaps make a form of legacy for them,\" she said.\"When people come along to see it, hopefully it's a way of entering peoples lives and trying to understand the situations that they're in at this time and also some of the issues that are being raised by that.\"The Cost of Dying exhibition runs from 25 April to 5 May, open to visitors from 09:00 to 17:00 and on Saturday from 10:00 to 16:00 at the Advanced Research Centre (ARC) at The University of Glasgow"

        "text": "After spending 10 years as a Buddhist nun in Myanmar, Coral Sunone realised that she needed some fashion help when she returned to the outside world.But with money tight, getting assistance from a professional stylist was simply out of the question. Or was it?Coral, who is based in Malaysia, heard of a website called TimeRepublik, which describes itself as \"a timebank for the internet era\".Time banking is in essence a more sophisticated form of bartering. You don't pay someone in money for a job that they do for you. Instead you give that person time credits that they can then use to get a service without financial payment from someone else.Via the TimeRepublik website, Coral was able to connect with Cherish Cullison, a New York-based professional wardrobe stylist and costume designer.Over Zoom, Cherish was able to help Coral find the modern clothing that best suited her.\"She styled me very well,\" says Coral. \"No money can pay for such a transaction, it is priceless, it is based on trust.\"The two have stayed in touch after they first met on TimeRepublik a few years ago. This has included Coral returning the favour of assistance, and giving Cherish some meditation lessons.Cherish says it is good that \"the expectation of money is out of the way\".\"Instead you really get to the core of things and you discover something, I think, that's greater and sort of priceless.\"TimeRepublik is the brainchild of Swiss co-founders Gabriele Donati and Karim Varini. They launched the first version in Switzerland back in 2012, but international expansion has come in the past couple of years.The website is free to use for members of the public. Users offering a service earn a \"TimeCoin\" credit. This amounts to 15 minutes no matter what job you provide, be it cutting the lawn of a neighbour, or maths tuition via a video call.You simply advertise what you are offering and how long it would take in TimeCoins.\"We wanted to distance ourselves from financial transactions and find something that could create relationships between people,\" says Mr Donati. \"Because we truly believe that only through our relationships, you can gain the trust of another person.\"TimeRepublik is today based in both Lugano, Switzerland and New York, and says it has more than 100,000 users around the world. It makes money by selling the service to companies who then offer it to their staff via their internal websites.The concept of time banking has been around. Mr Donati says that he wanted to bring it to a younger, and more digitally-savvy audience.is a series exploring how technological innovation is set to shape the new emerging economic landscape.Another organisation helping to take time banking online is charity Timebanking UK. This offers assistance and software to help communities and organisations across the UK set up their own time-banking schemes.The platforms allow users to post offers and requests, log hours and leave feedback.Timebanking UK's chief executive Sarah Bird highlights the built-in safeguarding features, such as users being able to flag any problems. \"So if something goes wrong with the local time bank, we can just jump in there and see if we can fix things,\" she says.Ms Bird also explains that while time banking does not replace professional services or government programmes, it can underpin them, and engage people who would not usually do traditional volunteering.She adds that the Department for Work and Pensions allows jobseekers totowards their time spent looking for paid employment.\"Time banking might be the first step that someone will take from long-term unemployment before they go on to maybe volunteer or on a training course, because it's a method of making that person feel more confident about themselves,\" says Ms Bird.Timebanking UK has also set up similar schemes overseas, in countries including China, Russia, India, South Korea and Thailand.At Cardiff-based Tempo Time Credits, its time-sharing model is a bit different. Instead of participants earning credits that they can redeem from someone else doing a job for them, they get credits that they can redeem at affiliated businesses, such as local gyms, cinemas, food shops and tourist attractions.Rachel Gegeshidze, chief executive of Tempo Time Credits, says its online-based system is a way of attracting and rewarding volunteers. It is used by local authorities across the UK to help develop projects aimed at key community improvements, such as addressing loneliness or tackling poverty.\"It really supports people to do new things and try new experiences... but also, we have programmes to engage tenants in their communities and to improve health and wellbeing,\" she says.The charity'sshowed that there were 10,731 active participants and about 1,100 involved organisations. The study also found that 84% of people taking part felt more positive about their future.Back at TimeRepublik, it says it doesn't wish to be seen as a replacement for cash economies, and that instead it was \"built to coexist\" with them.Cherish Cullison says that from her experience \"everyone has been very happy about the exchanges and I've met some really interesting people\"."

        "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-65484552",
        "text": "The government has allowed animal testing for makeup ingredients to resume despite a 25-year ban.It changed a policy on animal testing to align with EU chemical rules, according to a High Court ruling.The High Court said on Friday that the government was acting legally after a case was brought by animal rights activists.they are \"dismayed\" by the government's new position.A Home Office spokesperson told the BBC: \"We are pleased that the High Court has agreed with the Government's position in this case. The government is committed to the protection of animals in science\".Animal testing for makeup or its ingredients had been completely banned in the UK since 1998. Animal testing had only been allowed if the benefits gained from the research outweighed any animal suffering, for example for medicines.But in 2020 the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA), an EU agency which oversees chemical regulation, ruled that companies needed to test some ingredients used in cosmetics on animals to ensure they were safe for workers manufacturing the ingredients.During the case it was revealed that since 2019 the government had been issuing licences for animal testing of cosmetic ingredients in line with EU chemical rules, which it retained despite leaving the EU in 2020.This could include testing chemicals commonly found in foundations and concealers.It is not known how many such licenses were issued or to whom.Cruelty Free International (CFI), which brought the case, argued this was illegal and in breach of the animal testing ban for makeup and its ingredients, which has stood since 1998.Mr Justice Linden ruled in favour of the government, saying that the change in policy still met existing laws, although he said it was \"regrettable\" the public had not been informed.The change in the government's position has been heavily criticised by major beauty and cosmetic brands, including Unilever, Body Shop and Boots. Most major brands have long campaigned to end animal testing.Cruelty Free International said it was \"outrageous\" that the government had effectively lifted the ban.Christopher Davis, director of activism and sustainability at the Body Shop said they would \"campaign vigorously\" against the changes.\"Allowing animal testing for cosmetics would be a devastating blow to the millions of people who have supported campaigns to end this appalling practice,\" he told the BBC after the ruling.The ingredients that may be tested on animals include homosalate  - a common sunscreen ingredient used already in many foundations and skincare products.In low doses homosalate is safe but in higher concentrations the evidence forManufacturers can now apply for licenses to undertake animal testing before production begins, to ensure the safety of workers. But they still cannot undertake any animal testing to check the safety of the makeup for consumers. This should be done using other methods.Mr Justice Linden said that nothing was stopping the government from introducing an absolute ban on animal testing of makeup products if it desired.Cruelty Free International CEO Michelle Thew said: \"The case shows clearly that [the government] was prioritising the interests of contract-testing companies over those of animals and the wishes of the vast majority of British people who are strongly opposed to cosmetics testing.\"CFI said it would appeal the decision made by the court and ask the government to reinstate the complete ban in the UK.Dr Julia Fentem, head of the safety and environmental assurance centre at Unilever - one of the world's largest cosmetic companies - said tests potentially required under the new policy were \"unnecessary\", and that safety tests could be carried out without animal involvement.A new chemicals strategy is expected to be published this year outlining the government's position on the use and testing of chemicals in the UK - which may include further guidance to cosmetic companies.'Forever chemicals' still in use in UK make-upWhich animals are used in UK experiments?"

        "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/business-65328579",
        "text": "On the windy roof of a Burger King in Malm\u00f6, southern Sweden, Maggad Khalidy points to a large metal box attached to a jungle of pipes and wires.From the outside, it's far from an eye-catching innovation, but Mr Khalidy, who owns the fast food franchise that runs this restaurant, says it has saved the branch the equivalent of around $16,000 (\u00a313,000) a year in heating bills.The box contains a new form of heat exchange equipment called Lepido, developed by a Malm\u00f6 start-up called Enjay. It spotted a gap in the market for recovering energy from kitchen fumes, and using it to heat other areas inside restaurant buildings - helping to cut bills for conventional heating, and reduce emissions in the process.\"We were a bit sceptical in the beginning,\" says Mr Khalidy, whose Burger King franchise in the Malm\u00f6 suburb Bulltofta was selected for Enjay's initial pilot project in 2016. \"But we see the savings, and the return on investment is quite fast as well.\"Enjay is one of a handful of companies that can offer profitable energy recovery from kitchen exhaust.Lepido became commercially available in 2018 and has since been installed in around 25 Burger King franchises across Sweden, Norway and Denmark, as well as school and hotel kitchens across the Nordics and the Benelux region.Enjay's co-founder Nils Lekeberg says that an average-sized restaurant using Lepido can cut its heating bills by up to 90% a year, and reduce its annual carbon footprint by 30 tonnes.In the wake of, Enjay says it is now experiencing a surge in requests from restaurateurs from other parts of Europe, Canada and the US, despite doing little marketing outside the Nordics.Trials have recently started in several UK locations including a Burger King in Welwyn Garden City, Hertfordshire, and branches of the Caribbean restaurant chain Turtle Bay in Salford Quays near Manchester, and Brindleyplace in Birmingham.Matt Manfield, facilities manager for Turtle Bay in the UK, says he was \"blown away\" by the concept, after seeing the results of Enjay's trials in Sweden. \"We were looking at ways in which we could reduce our costs and become more sustainable, and this was at the forefront of what we'd found.\"Heat exchange systems that transfer warmth from one part of a building to another are already common in many industries, but recovering energy from industrial kitchens is challenging, explains Arne Speerfork, a professor specialising in thermodynamics at Hamburg University of Technology.The hot air in kitchens is full of grease and soot particles which \"stick on the surface\" of traditional heat exchange technologies and make it difficult to recover heat.As a result, the hot air produced during cooking processes is usually simply vented straight out of restaurant buildings.Enjay's technology is larger than conventional heat exchangers and is designed so that the grease and soot particles flow past the metal coils inside that transfer energy, instead of sticking to them, says Mr Speerfork.The hot air can then be pumped out over pipes carrying cold water, which then warms up and can be used to heat other parts of a building.\"It can for sure be effective,\" says Mr Speerfork, although he suggests the price of the product is likely to be a challenge for smaller independent restaurant owners.The average cost of buying and installing a Lepido heat exchanger is around $30,000 (\u00a324,000). However, Enjay's Nils Lekeberg argues most businesses should make that money back within a year or two.In Malm\u00f6 city centre, 56-year-old Orestis Georgiadis is heating pork on a rotisserie to make Greek gyros (meat in pita bread, similar to a kebab), at the family restaurant he's been running for 13 years.He is very interested in installing new energy-saving technologies to help cut costs and limit his restaurant's carbon emissions, but says there's \"no way\" he could afford technology like Enjay's without a loan from the bank or support from the Swedish state.As well as heating up his rotisserie, he needs energy to keep his pizza ovens on all day, power an industrial-sized dishwasher, and  store food supplies in his eight freezers and fridges. Paying his heating and electricity bills has been a struggle over the past year, especially since food prices in Sweden are also.Mr Georgiadis has resorted to turning off the heating in the venue's dining room to save money, which left his restaurant \"almost dead\" after 8pm during the winter months.He says things are picking up again due to milder spring temperatures, but he's not convinced he will be able to keep his restaurant open if his outgoings remain so high. \"If we will have these prices for one year, then I don't think I will survive it.\"Mr Speerfork argues that heat recovery from kitchen fumes could become a more competitive and \"solid market\" in future if high energy prices persist. \"The higher the energy prices become, the more interesting it is to invest even in technologies which are more expensive, for heat recovery,\" he says.Currently, Enjay's main competition is a small four-person British company called Dext, based in Barrowford in Lancashire. It has collaborated with Nando's and Sheffield Hallam University to develop a product called a Dirty Air Heat Exchanger, which has a similar function to capture \"wasted\" warmth from kitchen air vents.This has now been installed in 14 of the chain's restaurants and Nando's says it is planning to roll it out to more sites around the UK and Ireland.\"I think the more choice the customer has, the better,\" says Dext's commercial director Neil Bracewell. \"It's going to be a huge market, and heat recovery systems will become the norm. I'm amazed they aren't already. It seems such an obvious solution for an industry that produces so much heat.\"There is also plenty of scope for expanding the use of these types of technologies into other sectors where heat exchange has traditionally been challenging due to polluted air streams, says Mr Speerfork.Lepido's heat exchanger has already been installed in an industrial laundry in the Netherlands, and at Europe's largest pancake factory in Laholm in southern Sweden.\"I think you can feel that people are on a high,\" says Mr Lekeberg.He says in the first three months of this year Enjay had five times the number of enquiries that it had in the same period in 2022, a clear sign that businesses are trying to plan ahead to improve their energy efficiency as high prices continue.\"We have people calling in actively having found our product or seen something in terms of communication [where] they found the information themselves, rather than us pushing it on people,\" says Mr Lekeberg. \"That's a huge difference for a company.\""

        "text": "Tata Steel has warned that the finances of its UK business face \"material uncertainty\" given market conditions and the level of government support.Tata said a stress-test of its European arm to assess the impact of a downturn had flagged concerns for the UK unit.However, Tata Steel UK said it expected trading to pick up later this year.The Department for Business said the government is providing support to protect the steel industry from \"unfair trade and energy costs\".The UK business of India's Tata Steel employs about 8,000 people, with half at the Port Talbot steelworks in Wales.In results published last week, Tata said that earnings at Tata Steel Europe - which includes the UK business - fell by more than 60% in the year to 31 March.It added it had carried out tests to assess the potential impact of an economic downturn in Europe, given factors such as higher inflation and interest rates.These tests found the outlook for the UK business would be \"adversely impacted\", but it added it was continuing to \"implement various measures aimed at improving its business performance and conserving cash\".In July last year, Tata Steel said it would make a decision over the future of the its UK business in the next 12 months.One uncertainty hanging over Tata Steel UK is what level of help it could get from the government.The company is still in talks with the UK government over support to switch away from existing steelmaking processes to ones that emit less carbon.Currently natural gas helps heat the blast furnaces and carbon, in the form of coke, is used to make iron as part of the steel-making process.Replacing those processes with electric arc furnaces could reduce carbon emissions significantly especially if the electricity is generated from renewable sources.Reports have suggested that the firm will get \u00a3300m, although the cost of decarbonising the Port Talbot plant has been estimated at up to \u00a33bn.A decision on support is needed soon, as the life of Tata's blast furnaces are coming to an end and electric arc furnaces take between four and five years to build.Last month, Tata Steel UK told the Welsh Parliament that it wanted a \"level playing field\" with its European rivals to help it switch away from coal.The company's director of decarbonisation, Huw Morgan, said German firm Salzgitter had received \u20ac1bn towards its decarbonisation plans. \"That's half of the capital investment that we believe that they require to make the transition,\" he said.The Department for Business said: \"We consider the success of the steel sector a priority and will continue to work intensively with the industry to help secure a decarbonised, sustainable and competitive future.\"In a statement, Tata Steel UK said that while it \"starts the year at the bottom of the cycle with challenging market conditions given the difficult economic position in the UK and Europe, we ended 2022-23 with a positive cash balance and un-utilised financing facilities\".\"We are expecting that this - along with specific actions to improve business performance - will ensure that we manage this period of downturn.\"We should then be well placed to optimise our production and delivery volumes in 2023-24 as market conditions improve in the latter half of the year.\"Steel industry warns of more job cuts without helpGovernment to offer \u00a3600m for green steel switchSteel industry needs money soon, union boss warns"

I've accepted that advice. It is therefore with great hope that I declare Covid-19 over as a global health emergency,\" Dr Tedros said.He added that the decision had been considered carefully for some time and made on the basis of careful analysis of data.But he warned the removal of the highest level of alert did not mean the danger was over and said the emergency status could be reinstated if the situation changed.\"The worst thing any country can do now is to use this news as a reason to let down its guard, to dismantle the systems it has built, or to send the message to its people that Covid-19 is nothing to worry about,\" he said.The World Health Organization first declared Covid-19 to be a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) in January 2020.This signalled the need for coordinated global action to protect people from the new virus.It will now be up to individual countries to continue to manage Covid in the way they think best.Vaccines were one of the major turning points in the pandemic. According to the WHO, 13 billion doses have been given, allowing many people to be protected from serious illness and death.But in many countries vaccines have not reached most of those in need.More than 765 million confirmed Covid infections have been recorded worldwide.The US and UK, like many other countries, have already talked about \"living with the virus\" and wound down many of the tests and social mixing rules.Dr Mike Ryan, from the WHO's health emergencies programme, said the emergency may have ended, but the threat is still there.\"We fully expect that this virus will continue to transmit and this is the history of pandemics,\" he said.\"It took decades for the final throes of the pandemic virus of 1918 to disappear.\"In most cases, pandemics truly end when the next pandemic begins.\"US to end Covid vaccine air travel requirementsCovid whistleblower returns home to Wuhan after jail"

        "text": "Frankie Goes To Hollywood have played live for the first time in 36 years - but their long-awaited reunion was brief, lasting for just one song.The pop band, who were among the biggest stars of the 1980s, buried the hatchet to play for 25,000 people at a concert to mark the Eurovision Song Contest in their home city, Liverpool.They decided against playing their three UK number ones - Relax, Two Tribes and The Power of Love. Instead, they opted for Welcome To the Pleasuredome, a number two hit in 1985.When its rumbling rhythm and chanted lyrics kicked in, the band succeeded in rolling back the years.Now with white hair, and wearing a white suit and black gloves, frontman Holly Johnson's voice is still unmistakable.\"Bless you,\" he said to the crowd at the National Lottery's Big Eurovision Welcome concert. \"Lovely to see you all.\"There was no obvious sign of the acrimony that reportedly saw the group fight backstage before their final gig at Wembley Arena in 1987, and has lingered ever since.Just six weeks ago, when guitarist Brian \"Nasher\" Nash and two members of fellow band The Farm launched their guided tours under the banner Liverpool Music Icons Tours, a reconciliation was not on the cards.Nasher subsequently said he agreed to take part in the reunion so he could spend time in Liverpool with bassist Mark O'Toole and drummer Peter \"Ped\" Gill - with whom he has remained friendly and who no longer live in the city - and so they could \"feel a bit of Scouse love\".Allow Twitter content?This article contains content provided by Twitter.

To view this content choose\u2018accept and continue\u2019.While not one of the trio of chart-topping singles that made Frankie such a phenomenon, Welcome To the Pleasuredome is a great song, and is the title track from their remarkable debut album.By the time the tune drew to a close on Sunday, it sounded like the band were just warming up, as were the crowd. The fans were fully expecting them to launch in to Relax or Two Tribes.But then the group said a brief goodbye and walked off. There were muted cheers, as disbelieving murmurs rose from the audience instead. Even Atomic Kitten had performed two songs.If this performance was a one-off, it was a memorable if fleeting moment.Maybe one song is as much time as the five band members can bear to share a stage for - but at least they proved that they and their music can still sound compelling and fresh.And if relations have thawed, perhaps the 40th anniversary of that debut album next year could present an opportunity to see more of Frankie Goes To Hollywood.At Sunday's concert, outside Liverpool's St George's Hall, they were on a bill that also included The Lightning Seeds, Jamie Webster, The Real Thing, Ricky Tomlinson and Shirley Ballas.The show was \"Eurovision meets Scousevision\", as Lightning Seeds frontman Ian Broudie put it.Speaking beforehand, Atomic Kitten's Natasha Hamilton said: \"We're bringing everyone together. Liverpool is just a melting pot of people and cultures and music. And we get to perform to the crowd today and represent the city, which is amazing.\"As well as the local heroes, Ukraine's Jamala performed her 2016 Eurovision winning song 1944 with the United Ukrainian Ballet. She later joined British singer Birdy to cover The Beatles' All You Need Is Love, accompanied by the Liverpool Signing Choir.Another Eurovision legend, Conchita Wurst, performed 2014 winning song Rise Like A Phoenix against a light display by a fleet of drones.RuPaul's Drag Race UK winner The Vivienne performed Abba's Eurovision classic Waterloo. \"I'm like the Poundland version of Abba,\" she joked.There were also performances from pop stars Alexandra Burke and Zara Larsson.At the start of the show, there were concerns for crowd safety when a number of audience members climbed or were helped out of the area in front of the stage because of overcrowding.Shortly after it began, co-host Joel Dommett asked the audience to spread out, telling them: \"We don't want anyone to get hurt.\"Dommett presented the show with AJ Odudu.

But of course I'm also watching the robot - and I'm aware that it's watching me.This drumming experiment has been designed to test how the presence of a robot doing the same task affects a human's behaviour.It's one of many experiments of human-robot interaction being carried out by the research group CONTACT (Cognitive Architecture for Collaborative Technologies) at the Italian Institute of Technology in Genoa.Though I'm aware of the lights and the other people in the room, my gaze keeps being drawn to the iCub's heavy white eyelids.For one thing, there's a noticeable noise when the robot blinks every few seconds. And, because this childlike robot has expressive, oversized eyes, its gaze is compelling.This matters because with blinking, as with other aspects of eye gaze, there's more than strictly meets the eye.\"While it is often assumed that blinking is just a reflexive physiological function associated with protective functions and ocular lubrication, it also serves an important role in reciprocal interaction,\" comments Helena Kiilavuori, a psychology researcher at the University of Tampere in Finland.Human blinking conveys attention and emotion. As a means of non-verbal communication, it expresses a number of things we aren't consciously aware of, such as who should take a turn in a conversation.Thus, it's just one of many social signals humans exchange constantly without being aware of them, yet while deriving a great deal of information and comfort from them.So social roboticists have been studying both the physical and psychological properties of human blinking to understand why it might be useful to match it in robots.\"Due to the many important functions of blinking in human behaviour, it could be assumed that having robots blinking their eyes could significantly enhance their perceived human-likeness. This could, in turn, facilitate human-robot interaction,\" says Ms Kiilavuori.Put another way, \"When the robot's blinking well,\u202fpeople feel for your character,\" says David Hanson, who leads Hanson Robotics.Indeed, CONTACT research with 13-year-olds and adults in Italy shows that both groups simply. An unblinking robot can give a person the unpleasant impression of being stared at, points out Alessandra Sciutti, who leads the CONTACT unit.Humans also perceive robots that blink more. And intelligence matters in situations where humans depend on robots to provide information, such as in train stations.Despite the benefits of natural-looking blinking, integrating it into robots (apart from avatars and robots with screen displays for faces) is technically challenging.\"Blinks are one of the subtlest of human movements, so designing mechanisms that can mimic these movements require advanced technology, such as high-precision motors,\" Ms Kiilavuori explains. The roboticists at Engineered Arts, for example, use expensive, aerospace-grade motors as well as designing their own control electronics.Specifically, says Mr Hanson of Hanson Robotics, \"The speed of the motors moving skin material when blinking is really challenging and making the shape of the eye look natural while blinking is happening is also challenging. As well as reducing friction between artificial eyelids and the eye surface itself.\"Another issue here is a trade-off between the speed and sound of motorised blinking. Francesco Rea, a senior technician at the CONTACT unit, says that in the iCub robot a quieter motor could dampen the sound of a blink. But the slower movement then makes the robot look sleepy or catlike.Very slow blinks also risk a loss of visual information, as the iCub's camera is located behind the eyes. \"In vision, missing two frames is not that big an issue,\" says Mr Rea. \"Missing ten frames starts to be an issue.\"Ms Kiilavuori adds, \"Another challenge is the correct timing and duration of blinks.\" The different functions that blinking performs - such as how a person changes blinking speed while telling a lie - involve different eyelid dynamics as well as different emotional states.\"Any deviation from the natural and appropriate blinking times and duration, in a given context, can make the robot appear odd and disturbing,\" she says.The CONTACT team use a software program that partially randomises the intervals between single and double blinking. After all, blinking fixedly wouldn't look very natural either.Over at Disney Research, roboticists have joined forces with character animators to develop a research prototype for realistic robotic gaze. The aim is to design an expressive system of eye gaze that is easy for animators to control in order to convey subtle emotion.With elements like motion curves of eyelids, \"we can kind of isolate these individual behaviours, which makes it much easier to really concentrate on getting small aspects and small details correct,\" says James Kennedy, a research scientist at Disney Research.They'veof robotic sensing and control of eye gaze. This includes software for processing images taken by a camera in the robot's chest, and generating control signals for movements like opening and closing the eyelids.Mr Kennedy says that the research remains more experimental, and isn't yet being applied in Disney's theme parks. \"The goal here was to really select a single social cue that we were interested in and push it as far as we could in making lifelike believable motion and behaviour\u202fthat we felt would provide a platform for engagement with people.\"The technology would need to be refined in order, for instance, for the eye gaze system to remain believable in.Another general challenge would be getting humanoid robots to begin syncing their blinking patterns to those of humans, as humans do in conversation.These types of challenges remain compelling to some roboticists. And, contrary to exaggerated pop culture depictions of androids that are indistinguishable from humans, blinking is one tiny example of the many complexities that still keep robotic interactions from seeming completely natural.When trying to replicate a mechanism as tiny and sometimes underappreciated as blinking, \"actually you reveal how complex this mechanism is, and then how much subtle movement there is,\" notes Mr Kennedy. \"And that's where we have this really great opportunity for exploration and invention.\""

        "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/business-65415529",
        "text": "Morocco has big ambitions to export electricity produced by solar and wind farms to Europe, but should it be prioritising such renewable energy for its home market?\"The resources we have here could be one of the big, big answers to European demand,\" says Moroccan energy entrepreneur Moundir Zniber.Mr Zniber is a passionate man who senses opportunity out of crisis.\"I think Morocco represents the best opportunity to get the European continent away from the dependency it has today on Russian gas,\" he says.Mr Zniber has spent the past 15 years building his company, Gaia Energy, into one of the leaders of a renewable energy revolution in his home country.\"Morocco has truly one of the best solar and wind resources in the world combined,\" he says. \"We don't have oil, we don't have natural gas, but we have a potential that is just amazing.\"The war in Ukraine has catalysed Europe's politicians to increase their efforts to tackle climate change with new sources of clean energy. Morocco hopes to be part of the solution.It is on Europe's doorstep, and has ambitious plans to generate 52% of its electricity from renewable sources by 2030. The hope is that lots of this electricity will be exported via undersea cables to Europe.But at present, the country still has to build many more solar and wind farms. Currently the north African nation of 39 million people depends on imports forand most of that is from fossil fuels.In 2021, some 80.5% of Morocco's electricity productionBy contrast, only 12.4% came from wind power, and 4.4% came from solar.However, Morocco is already making some tangible progress to boost its renewable energy generation, thanks to projects such as the huge Noor-Ouarzazate Solar Complex. With the first phase opening back in 2016, this is now the world's largestSuch facilities use mirrors to reflect and concentrate sunlight onto central tower \"receivers\". These contain fluid that is heated by the light, creating steam that spins turbines to generate electricity.At Noor-Ouarzazate the mirrors are now spread over 3,000 hectares (11.6 sq miles). The facility was developed by Saudi Arabian firm ACWA Power, with funding also coming from the World Bank and European Investment Bank.Mr Zniber says that private Moroccan firms like his are now planning to export solar and wind-generated electricity to Europe, and green hydrogen - hydrogen that has been created by renewable energy.He adds that Gaia Energy is developing wind and solar schemes that could meet up to 4% of Germany and Italy's electricity needs. \"And in terms of green hydrogen we have six projects our company is developing that could answer 25% of the needs of the EU.\"Meanwhile, British energy start-up Xlinks has plans to build an undersea electricity cable from Morocco to the UK. Its hope is that Moroccan solar and wind power can provide 8% of the UK's electricity requirements by 2030.Increasing the size of Morocco's solar and wind power generation could help bolster economic growth in the country, according to the World Bank. It has provided millions of dollars of funding for the sectors.The benefits include a decoupling from the \"very heavy volatility of the prices of fossil fuels\", according to the World Bank's lead economist for the region, Moez Cherif.In a country with an unemployment rate of 11.2%, Mr Cherif adds that it could create as many as 28,000 much needed new jobs each year.He also says it would allow Morocco to \"position itself as an industrial hub for investments for exports of green industrial products\" such as car manufacturing using renewable energy.Yet the World Bank estimates that it will cost $52bn (\u00a341.6bn) for Morocco to hit its 2030 renewables target, with most of that money having to come from the private sector. The Moroccan government agrees with that.The administration is acutely aware of the potential benefits, and is trying to accelerate the renewable vision first laid out by King Mohammed VI in 2009.Morocco's Minister of Energy Transition and Sustainable Development Leila Benali says some of the slow growth in renewables in the country in recent years has been caused by global factors.\"The world is just coming out from a historic pandemic, total dislocation of supply chains and value chains - also affecting renewable energy, including the way we trade solar panels and wind turbines.\"However, she acknowledges there are also internal hurdles to overcome.Those include \"speeding up and streamlining bureaucracy\", including making sure companies get things such as \"access to land permits relatively fast to ensure that investors get access to the opportunities that they want\".Mrs Benali adds that the government's energy strategy is based on the three pillars of ramping up renewables, increasing efficiency, and more integration into international energy markets.When asked if it makes sense to export green electricity before all of Morocco's own needs are met through renewables, Mrs Benali says that the \"priority\" is for Moroccans to have access to the \"lowest-cost\" green energy.She adds that there is also a need to take advantage of the \"historic opportunity\" to integrate with Europe's energy market, and that such opportunities could be an incentive for the much needed private investment.The World Bank's Moez Cherif believes that Morocco should both increase exports of renewable power, and add more for domestic consumption. \"Ideally you should do both,\" he says.More from theAt last November'sin Sharm el-Sheikh, Morocco signed a memorandum of understanding with France, Germany, Portugal and Spain to make it easier to sell power across borders.However, climate change activist Hajar Khalmichi, from the Mediterranean Youth Climate Network, says she wants to see Morocco fulfil all its domestic energy needs from renewables before thinking of exporting any electricity.She also thinks that the ambition of 52% of electricity coming from renewables doesn't go far enough, and that there hasn't been enough discussion about where the rest will come from as Morocco tries to lower its dependency on its gas, oil and coal power stations.Ms Khalmichi adds that she is also concerned that the country is exploring for natural gas off its coastline.The Moroccan government counters that it has similar challenges to other countries that are going big on renewables, and that it needs gas to deal with the fact that the wind doesn't always blow and the sun doesn't always shine.Mr Cherif says \"there may be a role, a transition role for natural gas [in Morocco]\" as the move from fossil fuels to renewables will be a gradual one over the course of decades.Moundir Zniber adds that Morocco needs \"a mix\" of energy sources. \"Renewables are part of the solution on the electric side.\""

        "text": "It wasn't long into the process of auditing my wardrobe that I feared I would fail. Camisoles hanging under shirts; dresses hidden by jackets; crumpled jumpers fighting for drawer space. Halfway through, I'd already surpassed 74 garments. And that was before I remembered the suitcase in storage, containing my summer-only clothes.Apublished in 2022 by Berlin think tank Hot or Cool Institute suggests that a \"sufficient\" wardrobe consists of 74 garments and 20 outfits, with purchases of new garments limited to an average of five items per year. Based on the \"conservative estimate\" that 4% of global emissions come from fashion, the report's researchers said that the fashion industry would have to reduce its emissions to 1.1 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) in order to meet the. This equates to a roughly 50% reduction compared to the 2018 level of 2.1 billion tonnes, according to global consultancy.The figures for what constitutes a sufficient wardrobe were worked out by analysing fashion's carbon footprint in the world's 20 richest countries and establishing a fair footprint target for each person.As I looked through my wardrobe, my fear turned to shame. I checked in with fellow journalists Martha Henriques and Will Park, who were also carrying out a wardrobe audit. They, too, owned more clothes than the \"sufficient\" 74 items. And we were about to reveal our findings to Dilys Williams, director of the Centre for Sustainable Fashion at London College of Fashion, University of the Arts London, who had agreed to cast her expert eye over our clothing choices and make recommendations.\"My first thought is that it's a shame all three of you feel guilty and embarrassed \u2013 that's a harsh judgement on yourselves and the last thing the report should do,\" she says. \"Instead, it should encourage us to ask: what kind of lifestyle am I part of? Why have I got this number of pieces in my wardrobe? Is it because the fashion system is selling an ideal that doesn't exist?\"For Williams, the report shines a light on a pervasive culture of newness, driven by trends and supported by cheap prices and easy returns.\"Businesses are not paying for the full price of what they're making,\" says Williams. \"The accountancy model for fashion is flawed because it doesn't count the environmental and social costs \u2013 these are the societal costs we pay.\"'That's not to say we can't do anything about it. Despite the discomfort I felt over the size of my wardrobe, I'm proud of the change in my purchasing behaviour. In the last 12 months, I've only bought two items of clothing \u2013 84% of my clothes were bought more than five years ago. But because I'm choosing from a collection based on decisions I made a long time ago, my clothes aren't always reflective of who I am today, so I tend to wear the same items on repeat, which isn\u2019t much fun. According to the Waste and Resources Action Programme (Wrap), a British charity, about\"Getting dressed should be about being able to put on another skin, otherwise it's just functional,\" says Williams. \"So, why aren't you wearing your clothes? Is it really because you no longer like them or because you're out of the habit of wearing certain pieces? Have you tried styling different items together? Or upcycling?\"Dilys Williams, Ana Santi and William Park carry out an audit of their clothes (Credit: Javier Hirschfeld)I show Williams a skirt I'm particularly proud of. It had been hanging in my wardrobe unworn for 10 years until I took it to a local tailor to have the hem taken up, creating a completely new silhouette, from A-line to mini. It cost \u00a325 ($31) to repair. I could have bought a new skirt for the same price from that fast fashion retailer today.\"That's where the economics of the situation is another barrier \u2013 it's much cheaper to buy something new than get it mended or changed,\" says Williams, who, mirroring. \"But that one act of you not buying something new from a fast fashion retailer is a subversion of that retailer. It's also a myth that every low price item of clothing will fall apart. A lot of the durability of something comes down to how we look after it.\"We move on to knitwear, and I show Williams two jumpers: one is made from 100% traceable wool and I store it in a special bag that comes with a de-pilling comb, supplied by the retailer. It's my favourite jumper. The other is crumpled, pilled and tatty \u2013 a blend of polyester, viscose, cashmere and nylon.\"These mixed fibres won't biodegrade,\" says Williams. \"This jumper \u2013 that isn't desirable, that doesn't make you feel good \u2013 is here forever.\"The majority of our clothes are made from a blend of fibres. It's for this reason that\u2013 it's difficult to separate the fibres without degrading them, and thus create something new. What's more, polyester \u2013\u2013 is made from oil. In fact, synthetic materials like polyester.\"And yet wool is the most incredible fibre \u2013 it lasts longer and it's thermo-dynamic, meaning it keeps you warm in winter and cool in summer,\" says Williams, stroking my chunky wool jumper.I tell Williams \u2013 reluctantly \u2013 that I've never washed this jumper and vouch for its lovely smell. I simply air it outside. \"That's another cultural barrier,\" Williams laughs. \"We think that once we've worn something we need to wash it, which is not true. Washing degrades a garment.\"Fashion producesand it takes around 3,781I have 12 of them in my wardrobe. Most have lost their shape and the washes are unrecognisable from what I originally bought.\"Adding elastane into the cotton will make jeans less durable,\" Williams says, inspecting the care label. \"There's a reason why Levi's 501s have transcended time. Do you actually need that stretch? Or could you wear a jean in?\"'Jeans were not a consideration Martha had to make when auditing her wardrobe; her nemesis are leggings. \"The question I ask myself most mornings is: 'Can I get away with wearing leggings?' 90% of the time, the answer is 'absolutely',\" she says. \"But I've not yet found a good source of second-hand leggings of the sufficiently thick, hard-wearing and well-fitting variety that I live in \u2013 so I buy a couple of new pairs each year as they wear out.\"Even though Martha's leggings are made from \"sustainable\" viscose, to give them stretch they contain \u2013 like most \u2013 some elastane, a synthetic, fossil-fuel derived material. Recycled versions of these materials exist, but Williams warns that recycled synthetic fibres often come from a different supply chain \u2013 the plastics bottles industry, a worry. Williams' advice is to prioritise longevity; to find brands whose leggings last. Avoiding seams and caring for the garments by making better washing choices also help to prolong their life.A chart outlining the results of the wardrobe audit carried out by Ana Santi, Martha Henriques and Will Park (Credit: Javier Hirschfeld)What sets Martha's wardrobe apart is the percentage of clothes that were not bought new. A staggering 53% of her wardrobe is made up of second-hand or upcycled items,in the US.Still, second-hand clothing is, growing faster than any other channel in the fashion sector.between 2022 and 2026, according to aby Global Data, driven by the proliferation of second-hand platforms such as Vinted and Depop.We currently live in an unsustainable world. While the biggest gains in the fight to curb climate change will come from the decisions made by governments and industries, we can all play our part. In, BBC Future explores how each of us can contribute as individuals to reducing carbon emissions by living more sustainably, without breaking the bank.\"Some of my second-hand clothes are so well-loved I haven't been able to throw them away even after they were worn into holes,\" Martha says. \"If I can conceal the holes by rolling up a sleeve or patching them up, I do. As I see it, the things you wear into holes are, by definition, the best clothes in your wardrobe.\"Yet despite Martha's attachment to her considered purchases, she was surprised to discover many pieces she didn't know she owned \u2013 as much as 25%. Martha blames this on poor storage solutions. Williams asks her how she felt when she discovered them again.\"A lot of the old clothes I don't wear have sentimental value, so it was nice to rediscover them,\" Martha says. \"Some of them I know I'm unlikely to wear again but can't bring myself to donate, but others I\u2019m thinking of reviving. A few have gone to the charity shop.\"'Will, by contrast, knows every single item in his wardrobe and wears 95% of it (the remaining 5% is made up of vintage football shirts, treasured items collected over the years). He attributes this to a simple wardrobe, with muted colour palettes of navy, grey and beige, and simple silhouettes.And, Williams tells Will, \"you obviously have a good level of scrutiny before you buy something\". \"Yes, you do own more garments than make a sufficient wardrobe, but you don't succumb to the stimulus like the average person. You have a much better price x wear = value ratio.\"About a third of Will's wardrobe is made up of sportswear, which tends to be made of nylon and polyester blends. \"My suspicion is that these items will not score well in terms of environmental impact,\" he concedes. \"Most of the tops and shorts I wear for the gym are manufactured many miles from here. They are also washed after every use, usually at 40C (104F).\"He's right. Washing synthetic fibres releases microplastics, which pollute our waterways. Textiles are the largest source of primary microplastics,. Research from Leeds University in the UK found that reducing both washing cycle length and water temperatureand reduce the quantity of dye and microfibres shed into the environment.However, Williams suggests also looking beyond materials to the practices of sportswear brands and, in particular, checking out signatories of the United Nations'. The charter commits signatories to keeping within 1.5C, with initiatives such as swapping to renewable energy to power factories.Journalist Ana Santi and sustainable fashion professor Dilys Williams carry out a wardrobe audit (Credit: Javier Hirschfeld)Will's sportswear wardrobe includes skiwear, which he only wears once a year. It's an area ripe for the rental market, says Williams. Will could rent out his ski gear for most of the year, keeping the items in use and making some extra money on the side.is one specialist skiwear rental platform in the UK, although many fashion platforms also offer the category. The danger is that, through regular use, the items may not last as long, but the growing professionalism of the rental market to include things like insurance encourages renters to look after and prolong the life of garments.At the start of our wardrobe audits, the three of us had one key trait in common: we all owned more clothes than were deemed \"sufficient\" by the Hot or Cool Institute. We now have another: despite the report's allowance of five new items per year, none of us feels the urge to buy that much. Personally, I'll be investing in new swimwear \u2013 mine has lost its shape (and I'm a regular swimmer) \u2013 but that's it. Martha will continue to buy leggings, but look into alternatives.\"Honestly, I don't feel I need anything,\" says Will. \"My flip-flops have seen better days, but it doesn't feel urgent. The football team I support has released a really nice new shirt, and in my defence I haven't bought a new one since 2013. But after the audit I am struggling to justify purchasing one.\"So is there a formula for auditing a wardrobe, for making better clothing choices? While there is \"no silver bullet\", Williams suggests splitting your existing wardrobe into two categories: investment and cost. \"For items that you love and wear, that you feel good about, that reflect your identity and values \u2013 they're an investment,\" she explains. \"The garments whose provenance you're unsure of, that make you feel uncomfortable, that hang unworn in your wardrobe \u2013 these are a cost.\"But with\u2013 and 65% of these end up in landfill within 12 months \u2013 any action we take to avoid buying new clothing will help solve fashion's biggest problem: overproduction. By making adjustments to our wardrobes and own consumption, we will send a message to government and businesses \u2013 and change the system. As Williams says: \"Collectively, as citizens, we have a lot of power.\"--"

One of their operations was bugging the Democratic National Committee offices at the Watergate complex, an undertaking that backfired so spectacularly that the suffix \"-gate\" is used to this day to indicate a scandal. There have been numerous dramas about this and just last year,featured some of these events. HBO Max has gone the satirical route with a script from the writers of Veep. The five-part series stars Justin Theroux and Woody Harrelson as G Gordon Liddy and E Howard Hunt, the hapless pair who accidentally brought down the president they were trying to protect.White House Plumbers premieres 1 May on HBO Max in the US, and soon on Sky Atlantic and NOW in the UK(Credit: Netflix).Regency romance Bridgerton is one of the jewels in Netflix's crown, so it's no surprise that we're getting another drama set in that universe. This is the origin story of Queen Charlotte, a character from the parent show who was a real-life historical figure: German aristocratCharlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz who became the wife of King George III. As the six-part series begins, young Charlotte (India Amarteifio), from a tiny province in Germany, is on her way to meet the king of England (Corey Mylchreest), her brother Adolphus having signed a \"betrothal contract\". Charlotte's really not thrilled about it. She is, in the words of her brother, \"exceedingly headstrong\".

The show presents a fictionalised version of Davidson's life and there's certainly plenty of material to work with. Davidson has been open about his mental health struggles and his drug use, while gossip columnists have chronicled his love life in some detail: in the past, he has had relationships with Kim Kardashian, Ariana Grande, Kate Beckinsale and Phoebe Dynevor. Davidson is co-writing the show, which co-stars Edie Falco as his mother and Joe Pesci as his grandfather.Bupkis premieres 4 May on Peacock in the US(Credit: Apple TV+)Apple TV+ has really leaned into science fiction since its launch and shows such as Severance, For All Mankind,and Invasion are a key part of its offering.

        "text": "\"Hip-hop is the folk dance of today,\" said\u00a0Natasha\u00a0Khamjani, breathing heavily. They're both social dances created for crowd participation, both also existing on the fringes of the mainstream, she added. Khamjani was taking a quick break during a rehearsal of a high-energy performance blending Bollywood moves and English country dancing with the unmistakable bounce of hip-hop moves.In an unexpected twist, Khamjani and her troupe were also dancing under a rainbow of swirling maypole ribbons \u2013 a sight more commonly associated with English village fetes rather than a basement in inner-city London. Nearby, the hum of Camden's traffic competed with the soundtrack of fiddle, banjo and beatboxing pumping from the speakers.At first glance, this veritable mash-up of genres and cultures seemed an unlikely marriage. But for Khamjani, artistic director of, a collective putting a global spin on old-time English dances, a natural synergy exists. These are the dances of the people, bubbling up from the streets, pubs, village greens, dance halls and international communities that birthed them, Khamjani explained. An easy fit between age-old English country dances and house music exists, she pointed out. \"It sounds weird but the steps are basically the same,\" she laughed, overlooked by imposing stag antlers mounted to the wall at the.Remixing maypole dancing is just one of the myriad ways that English folk culture is currently having a reboot, thanks to a new wave of switched-on folkies diversifying the scene. At the heart of this progressive movement is the Cecil Sharp House, a music venue and folk arts centre that's home to the(EFDSS) and where Folk Dance Remixed perform regularly.Folk Dance Remixed combines folk music with contemporary street dance styles (Credit: Zoey Goto)Named after Cecil Sharp, a folk music enthusiast who roamed the countryside of England and the US South collecting folk music and dances in the early 20th Century, this temple to vernacular culture threw open its Arts and Crafts-style doors in 1930. Nowadays, it competes with the colourful street theatre of neighbouring Camden Market, making it easy to pass this non-descript building without realising the hotbed of cultural boundary-pushing that lurks behind its terracotta brick facade.Over the last few years, the EFDSS has ramped up its outreach efforts to engage new audiences, mixing diverse cultural traditions to create new interpretations of \"Englishness\". Projects have included teaming up with musician, pioneer of the British Bhangra sound, an upbeat musical style that mixes traditional Punjabi beats with Western pop, to uncover similarities between. There have beentaught to schoolchildren; and feminist-themed pop-up events, including a recording of the podcastat the house.Certain projects have undeniably chimed easier than others. Take for example Queer Folk'shosted at Cecil Sharp House, where evenings of LGBTQ ceilidh dancing and drag acts have proved a sell-out success. Musicians Sophie Crawford and George Sansome of Queer Folk also teamed up with the EFDSS to delve into the institution's song archives. They found a wealth of examples of \"queer sex, romance and gender non-conformity, as well as signs of the mistreatment and persecution of trans and gender-non-conforming people\", Sansome noted. \"It's really powerful to see these parallels in songs from hundreds of years ago.\"Katy Spicer, chief executive and artistic director at EFDSS, is looking to make the English folk scene more inclusive (Credit: Rosie Reed-Gold/EFDSS)Joining me in the main hall at the Cecil Sharp House beneath a whimsical mural of folkloric creatures and abstract dancing figures, Katy Spicer, the chief executive and artistic director at EFDSS, pointed out that it is, however, a work in progress making the English folk scene truly inclusive. \"In terms of diversity, ethnicity has been the hardest challenge\" she said.Somewhat ironically, it's possible to trace the roots of this reluctance back to the late 19th- and early 20th-Century folk music collectors, including Cecil Sharp himself. Their cannon of work focussed on the white, rural working-class dances and ballads, marking the genre out as a white heritage space and overlooking the cross-cultural exchanges that have always existed.\"There was perhaps a tunnel vision back then and histories not recorded, which no one questioned until recently. We're working to set the record straight,\" Spicer said, as a group of teenagers, part of the, shuffled onstage to tune violins ready for the evening's show. \"Particularly when you have English in your title, you have to address what it means to be English and whose England is it?\" she added, as the audience started to file into the hall, spanning in age from toddlers to grandparents.Cecil Sharp House is at the heart of progressive British folk culture (Credit: Rosie Reed-Gold/EFDSS)Exploring some of these overlooked histories and racial crosscurrents is Cohen Braithwaite-Kilcoyne, a singer, musician and rising star of the folk scene, who in 2021 collaborated with the EFDSS on the. The work explored links between English folk and music-making among enslaved people in former British colonies in the US Southern states and the Caribbean.\"I'd always been aware that there are songs and ballads that crop up across English folk music traditions and the music of Black America and the Caribbean, but perhaps hadn't quite realised the extent of the shared repertoire,\" he told me. \"These songs started life in Britain and migrated with the people to the Americas. It seemed that there was a certain amount of cultural exchange between the white colonisers and Black enslaved people,\" he said of his research, which unearthed examples of similar storytelling and melodies across the three traditions. \"But the very nature of folk song means that as it's passed along orally, you get an evolution.\"Often still viewed as a relic from a dusty, bygone era, folk has also long struggled to attract a younger, hipper crowd. But things look set to change, thanks in part to folk pioneer and artist Alex Merry, an EFDSS alumnus. Having learnt to Morris dance (a choreographed group dance dating to the European courts of the 15th Century) on the fabled floorboards at the Cecil Sharp House 15 years ago, Merry has since formed the all-female \"prog-morris\" dance group.All-female dance group Boss Morris is bringing an inclusive and fresh approach to folk dance (Credit: Zoey Goto)Bringing Morris dancing high-stepping into the mainstream, Boss Morris performed onstage with the indie rock group Wet Leg at the BRIT Awards in February 2023. Sparking more than half a millionto date, the performance was a riot of fluttering hankies, folk-meets-clubwear costumes and mythical beast mascots, causing a flurry of online comments from curious viewers.In search of this new wave of folksters, I headed to the market town of Stroud to catch Boss Morris preparing to rehearse in a draughty village hall. Wearing jangling bells at their legs and crowns of golden corn, Merry and her dance side were keen to point out that although it's still perceived as a male-dominated pastime, women have always Morris danced, even if only on the fringes of the limelight.\"We're not doing anything brand new,\" Merry said, sitting on the gnarly wooden floorboards with a steaming cup of tea. \"And nowadays, there's actually more women taking up Morris dancing than men, so the pendulum has swung,\" she added, wearing a kit emblazoned with a geometric sun to represent the upcoming summer solstice.According to Boss Morris dancer Lily Cheetham, trad-folk arts have become more popular since the pandemic (Credit: Zoey Goto)The recent wave of enthusiasm for trad-folk arts has been driven by a need to get back to basics in the digital era, plus a desire to reconnect with the land following the pandemic, said fellow dancer Lily Cheetham, her face decorated with curling black snakes and a flash of bright lipstick. \"People are looking for a sense of place and identity. And it's about redefining what being British can be.\"In a unison of tidy lines and rhythmic leaps, Boss Morris started to practice the routines that they'll be passing onto others at festival workshops and street parties across England this summer. Turning to leave, it occurred to me that if hip-hop is the folk dance of today, I'd come full circle and witnessed England's original street dance: Morris dancing. Reassuringly, it wasn't stuck in the past but was keeping up with the times, as all good art forms must do to survive."

        "link": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/65494103",
        "text": "Monday, 8 May 2023 marks 10 years since the seismic news of Sir Alex Ferguson's retirement was confirmed by Manchester United.The story broke in the media on the night before the official announcement, despite the extraordinary lengths United went to try and keep it secret.A decade on, it could be argued the club still hasn't recovered from Ferguson's exit.The Scot remains the most decorated manager in British football.He won 13 Premier League titles, five FA Cups, four League Cups, two Champions Leagues, a European Cup Winners' Cup, a European Super Cup, an Intercontinental Cup and a Fifa Club World Cup during his time at Manchester United.Add to that the three Scottish titles, four Scottish Cups, Scottish League Cup, European Cup Winners' Cup and European Super Cup he won as manager of Aberdeen.Now 81, in his autobiography 'Alex Ferguson', he detailed why he decided to quit after nearly 27 years in one of the game's toughest and most high-profile jobs.'\"I'm going to retire,\" he told wife Cathy, around Christmas 2012.'\"Why are you going to do that,\" she replied.\"Cathy, who had lost her sister Bridget in the October and was struggling to come to terms with that bereavement, soon agreed it was the right course. Contractually, I was obliged to tell the club by 31 March if I was going to stand down that summer,\" wrote Ferguson.So set in motion the wheels for Ferguson's departure. It was also the beginning of an attempt to keep one of the biggest stories of the Premier League era under wraps at perhaps its most-scrutinised club.BBC Sport has spoken to a number of sources around United at that time for an insight into the process that ended with an amazing 5-5 draw in Ferguson's last game as a manager at West Brom on 19 May.Ferguson told United chief executive David Gill of his plans early in 2013.Gill had initially called their meeting to tell Ferguson of his own departure.Having worked closely with Ferguson for more than a decade, Gill wanted the manager to be among the first to know he intended to stand down the following summer, hoping a lack of club ties would improve his chances of taking a seat on Uefa's powerful executive committee.However, Gill was surprised to hear Ferguson reveal that the current season would also be his last at Old Trafford.The news stayed secret for months.Long after the 31 March deadline passed, only a select few, including United's owners, the Glazer family, knew of Ferguson's impending exit.However, looking back, there was a giant clue.On 5 March,They had been ahead in the tie when United winger Nani was sent off. On the touchline, Ferguson was furious.When the teams returned to the dressing room, Gill went to speak to Mike Phelan, Ferguson's assistant.Phelan had been Ferguson's regular stand-in for post-match interviews with the BBC during the manager's seven-year boycott of the broadcaster over a disputed documentary about his son Jason.In addition, the only time the United manager conducted the separate post-match media conferences was after European games when it was a contractual requirement.Despite the magnitude of the game and the unprecedented nature of the request in a European context, Gill told Phelan that he would have to take the place of an upset and angry Ferguson in front of the media. Ferguson said the same.The feeling was Ferguson might say something he would regret.Phelan told the media Ferguson was \"distraught\" and \"in no fit state\" to talk to them.What Ferguson and Gill knew, but neither Phelan nor anyone in the media were aware of, was that the loss signalled the end of the manager's final chance to lift the trophy he coveted the most once more.His combination of rage and incredulity at the performance of Turkish referee Cuneyt Cakir was heightened by the knowledge there could be no chance of redemption. In Champions League terms, it was the end.It wasn't until early April that the circle of trust was widened.Even then, it extended to no-one other than those who, for operational reasons, had to know about Ferguson's departure and, crucially, could be trusted.A couple of weeks later, on 22 April, United secured the title when Robin van Persie scored a hat-trick in a 3-0 win against Aston Villa.Van Persie had been recruited from Arsenal the previous summer, having received personal assurances from Ferguson that he had no plans to stand down.But the Scot had changed his mind and that title success paved the way for a plan to be put in place.It was not a given at that time United would arrange an open-top bus parade to celebrate winning the Premier League.They famously didn't have one after winning the Premier League and Champions League in 2008, nor the following season when they won the Premier League title and reached the Champions League final.However, on the basis Manchester City had celebrated their own success 12 months earlier with a parade, nothing seemed too unusual in United saying they wanted one as well.Those at the club with responsibility for marking key moments were told to push the boat out. It was, after all, they were told, a milestone 20th championship. Behind that push lay the knowledge it would also be marking Ferguson's last.Still, hardly anyone knew the reality. The announcement of Ferguson's departure was set for the morning of Wednesday, 8 May.On the Tuesday morning, a meeting was called for various staff members.They were told to prepare for a big announcement, as big as it was possible to be, for the following morning. The tone of the conversation was to steer people towards believing it was transfer or sponsorship related.But, at the end of the meeting, a lone voice stated firmly \"the king is dead, long live the king\". Those present who were aware of Ferguson's exit were stunned.It hadn't been spelt out but there could be no greater steer as to what was about to unfold.As the meeting broke up, so the rumours spread, initially across United's Carrington training ground, then out, to the annual golf day organised by former players at the exclusive Dunham Forest course in Cheshire.As speculation swirled, staff in the know realised their secret was getting away from them.Senior figures on the coaching staff received text messages informing them of the golf day gossip.Key website workers were told to report to Old Trafford for 06:00 BST the following morning. Some, who got on well with the media, were bombarded with calls and eventually opted to switch their phones off.The stories of Ferguson's impending departure appeared online later that evening. The Telegraph was first, but were followed almost immediately by the remainder of Fleet Street.By the following morning, the reports were being carried by radio and TV outlets.Ferguson was not happy. He wanted the information to come from him.As the staff he worked closest with arrived for work, he asked to see them. He apologised for the manner in which the information had come out, but confirmed he was standing down. The meetings were brief, no longer than 10 minutes.Preparations then continued for the final two games - against Swansea and West Brom - as though nothing had happened, even though almost all were blindsided.In the preceding months, Ferguson had been part of numerous meetings to discuss that summer's pre-season trip to Australia and the following campaign. He was in good health. Nothing hinted at the massive decision he had made.Then Ferguson went to see his players. At the same time, the official announcement was being prepared for release.The response of the players was typical of a group of younger men being addressed by an older one. There were a myriad of jokes about the lack of dressing-room dressing-downs in the future, of their relief Ferguson was finally going and predictions he would change his mind anyway and be back next season.At Old Trafford the mood was more serious and more tense. The number of staff arriving early alerted security staff to a something significant in the offing. It merely reinforced what they were reading and hearing in the media.Those responsible for publishing the information were taken to Box 30, or the 'War Room' as it is known internally, on the first tier of the East Stand. It is the most private hospitality box at the stadium. Most recently it was seen in promotional video Ferguson filmed with Wrexham co-owners Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney to publicise the clubs' pre-season meeting in San Diego this July.The actual detail of the press release was only finalised 10 minutes before it was due to go live.The statement itself, containing lengthy quotes from Ferguson, Gill and co-chairmen Joel and Avram Glazer, was checked and re-checked to make sure it went out without error. All involved understood the scale of what would happen when the send button was pressed.Sure enough, for a while, the United website couldn't cope as the number of visitors brought it to a standstill.Back in the canteen at Carrington, Ferguson, accompanied by son Jason, spoke to remaining staff. It was an emotional morning. He had to steady himself on a couple of occasions to get through. Little wonder, once his various addresses had been made, he felt the need to return home to Wilmslow to clear his head.Four days later, Ferguson's final programme notes were published. Unlike some managers, who don't write or even read them, he always spent time thinking about the message he wanted to deliver.\"It is the right time,\" he said.\"It was important to me to leave the organisation in the best possible shape and I believe I have done so.\"He paid tribute to his wife and family, his players and staff, club legend and friend Sir Bobby Charlton, Gill and the Glazer family.He finished with this thank-you to the fans:\"It has been an honour and enormous privilege to have had the opportunity to lead your club and I have treasured my time as manager of Manchester United.\"Frank Sinatra's 'My Way' and Nat King Cole's 'Unforgettable' were played before kick-off.Rio Ferdinand didn't quite score the winner in 'Fergie-time' but the 87th minute was late enough to be a fitting end to Ferguson's last game at Old Trafford.He emerged, in the pouring rain, to take the acclaim of a packed stadium.Typically, he took the microphone and declared he had \"no script in his mind, I am just going to ramble on\" before finding exactly the right words, across four minutes, including \"you have been the most fantastic experience of my life\" and \"your job now is to stand by our new manager\". His grandchildren then accompanied him on a final lap of the stadium.One week later, at West Brom, it really was the end.The United players presented Ferguson with a 1941 Rolex watch, marking the year of his birth. They also gave him a book of photographs depicting his time at United. It included shots of his family, who were with him on that final momentous day at the Hawthorns.He had a meal with his coaching staff on the night before the game, although given the level of uncertainty some of them were experiencing, the mood was reflective rather than celebratory.Ferguson was said to be relaxed in the dressing room beforehand, but his behaviour was reasonably normal for a matchday.A trade union shop steward in Glasgow's shipyards before he moved into football, Ferguson's final team talk concentrated on working-class values. He urged his players to show their personalities, play the Manchester United way and play to win.He had a joke with fourth official Chris Foy when he made his way through the guard of honour formed by players of both sides. As usual, he sat between Phelan and first-team coach Rene Meulensteen on the bench.There was the familiar sight of him chewing gum in frustration as Romelu Lukaku completed a hat-trick and West Brom fought back from 5-2 down to claim a draw. However, those close by noted the usual anger was missing.At the final whistle, Ryan Giggs pushed Ferguson in front of the players to acknowledge the visiting fans. Paul Scholes was supposed to be with him as he prepared for his - second - retirement but, typically, the then media-shy midfielder was nowhere to be seen.Back in the dressing room, Giggs reflected on the manner of the ridiculous result and, with the then-Everton manager already extensively linked as Ferguson's successor, joked: \"David Moyes has just resigned.\"Ferguson's coaching team went for the usual post-match chat with West Brom boss and fellow Scot Steve Clarke, who in his programme notes for the game had said: \"The scale and eloquence of the tributes that have come his way speak volumes for the scale of his contribution to the game.\"West Brom had taken the unprecedented step of including an astonishing 40-page tribute to Ferguson in their match programme. Later they sent on the official teamsheets, all signed.Looking back, United were in the process of making a number of mistakes.That night, half a dozen key staff met for a drink on the outskirts of Manchester to discuss what had happened and where United went from there. There were no big meetings planned to outline the future.Ferguson, understandably, decided to step away completely to ensure his presence didn't restrict Moyes as he took over the reins.Incredibly, United did not buy Moyes out of the remainder of his Everton contract. It was 1 July - a month and a half after Ferguson's final game - before he could begin work properly.Moyes faced the media for the first time, alongside Nemanja Vidic in a news conference to promote the club's pre-season tour a few days later. But he was already playing catch-up and never recovered the ground.Within 12 months, in addition to Ferguson, Gill and Scholes, Phelan, Meulensteen, goalkeeping coach Eric Steele, Ferdinand, Vidic and full-back Patrice Evra had all left the club. Giggs retired. Within two years, respected youth team coach Paul McGuiness and academy director Brian McClair had gone as well.It really was the end of an era. Nothing at Manchester United would ever be the same again."

        "text": "He has been a mainstay in the Manchester United goal for more than a decade, but is David de Gea's Old Trafford future now in the balance?The Spaniard made a horrendous mistake to gift Said Benrahma a goal that proved to be the winner for West Ham on Sunday, damaging the Red Devils' hopes of finishing in the Premier League's top four in the process.The 32-year-old has now made four errors leading to a goal in all competitions this season, the joint most of any Premier League player, along with Hugo Lloris.In February De Gea said contract talks at Old Trafford wouldand he was \"enjoying it\" - but for many fans and pundits this may be one mistake too many.\"If he's in contract negotiations, making mistakes like that is never going to help,\" former Liverpool, Tottenham and Stoke striker Peter Crouch told BT Sport.\"He's been a top-class goalkeeper over the years, but at the moment it feels like he's making big errors in big, big games.\"David de Gea has had a shocker, we can't dress it up. You can't justify it at all, it's a terrible mistake.\"Former Newcastle and Tottenham midfielder Jermaine Jenas was equally critical, telling BT Sport: \"That's beyond shocking. His team is in full control of this game and to let one in like that. He'll know himself.\"Former Manchester United defender Rio Ferdinand added: \"It's a bad mistake. He will take full responsibility for that.\"His left foot does slip slightly but that's no excuse, he's got full contact on the ball. It's not like he is stretching and getting fingertips on it.\"There is no doubting De Gea's pedigree. He has made more than 500 United appearances since arriving from Atletico Madrid in 2011, winning the club's player of the year award four times and lifting the Premier League, FA Cup, League Cup and Europa League trophies.Unsurprisingly manager Erik ten Hag leapt to the player's defence, pointing out that he is in contention for the Premier League Golden Glove after keeping 15 clean sheets so far this season - two more than anybody else.\"Mistakes are part of football and in this team you have to deal with it and bounce back because it is a team sport,\" said the Dutchman.\"Over the season he is the one with the most clean sheets and also we did it as a team. It can happen, it's football but everybody has to take responsibility.\"But with his contract due to expire at the end of the season mistakes like Sunday are unlikely to help negotiations and leave the Red Devils boss with a decision to make.Ferdinand says it is De Gea's ability with his feet rather than any issue with his shot-stopping that may prompt Ten Hag to make a change.\"The question mark about him I think is whether he's good enough with his feet to play the Erik ten Hag way,\" he said.\"In terms of shot-stopping, he's made a mistake today - but that's not the area I question him. Is he a good enough footballer to play for Manchester United?\"The only person that can answer that is Erik ten Hag and we'll know at the end of this season.\"Crouch added: \"It's a strange one, because he's conceded goals from his own mistakes but he's also kept the most clean sheets in the league.\"Honestly do not know what has happened to De Gea this season. From a consistent Player of the Year contender to an even greater liability than Lloris in just one year. Renewing his contract now seems like one of the worst mistakes we could make.It really is time for United to move on from De Gea. His lack of quality distributing the ball is already at odds with what Ten Hag seems to want from his goalkeeper, and there are just too many errors in his game now.: In a game we have to win, De Gea is doing us no favours. Abysmal goalkeeping.When we say De Gea is not good enough, this is just an example. The number of errors he made over the last few years, especially under Ole [Gunnar Solskjaer] and now under Ten Hag is incredible. There is no way he should be a starter next season if we want to move forward.Sadly there's very little place for sentiment in sport if you're looking to build a winning team, so it's time for De Gea to go in my opinion."

The bomb would explode on the appropriately named\u2013 the border between the light and dark side of the Moon \u2013 to create a bright flash of light that anyone, but particularly anyone in the Kremlin, could see with the naked eye. The absence of an atmosphere meant there wouldn't be a mushroom cloud.There is only one convincing explanation for proposing such a horrendous plan \u2013 and the motivation for it lies somewhere between insecurity and desperation.In the 1950s, it didn't look like America was winning the Cold War.held that the Soviet Union was ahead in the growth of its nuclear arsenal, particularly in the development, and number, of nuclear bombers (\"the bomber gap\") and nuclear missiles (\"the missile gap\").In 1952,. Three years later the Soviets shocked Washington by. In 1957 they went one better, stealing a lead in the space race with the, the first artificial satellite in orbit around the world.It didn't help American nerves that Sputnik was launched on top of a Soviet intercontinental ballistic missile \u2013 albeit a modified one \u2013 nor that the US's own attempt to launch an \"artificial moon\". The inferno that consumed their Vanguard rocket was captured on film and shown around the world. A: \"THE VANGUARD FAILS\u2026a big setback indeed\u2026in the realm of prestige and propaganda...\"The successful launch of Sputnik in 1957 caused consternation in the West (Credit: Getty Images)All the while, US schoolchildren were being shown the famousinformation film, in which Bert the animated turtle helps teach children what to do in the event of a nuclear attack.Later that same year, US newspapers citing a senior intelligence source reported that \"Soviets to H-Bomb Moon On Revolution Anniversary Nov 7\" (The Daily Times, New Philadelphia, Ohio) and then followed it up with reports that the Soviets might already be planning to launch a nuclear-armed rocket at our nearest neighbour.Like with other Cold War rumours, its origins are hard to fathom.Strangely, this scare also likely motivated the Soviets to develop their plans., their plan was a carbon copy of the Americans', and eventually dismissed by the Soviets for similar reasons \u2013 the fear that a failed launch could result in the bomb dropping down on Soviet soil. They described the potential for a.Gifted mathematician Sue Finley played a vital role in a series of Nasa missions to send probes to the Moon to obtain images of the lunar surface, select a landing site for Apollo, and gain further data to make that mission a success.Finley would go on to play an essential role in the design of the, a vast network of radio antennas around the world used to track space missions.African-American Catherine G Johnson\u2019s specialism was the vital skill of calculating the trajectories of space shots and timing the launches. Johnson\u2019s calculations influenced every critical US space mission from Mercury to the Space Shuttle, including Apollo 11.They may have simply realised that landing on the Moon was the bigger prize.But Project A119 would have worked.In 2000 Reiffel had his say. He confirmed that it was \"technically feasible\", and that the explosion would have been visible on Earth.The loss of the pristine lunar environment was less of a worry to the US Air Force despite the scientists' concerns.\"Project A119 was one of several ideas that were floated for an exciting response to Sputnik,\" says, a historian of science and nuclear technology, \"that included shooting down Sputnik, which feels very spiteful. They refer to them as stunts\u2026 designed to impress people.\"Now what they did in the end was put up their own satellite, and that took a little while, but they continued this project somewhat seriously, into at least the late 1950s.\"It is a pretty interesting window into the sort of American mindset at that time. This push to compete in a way that creates something very impressive. I think, in this case, impressive and horrifying are a bit too close to each other.\"He isn't sure that fear of the anti-communist witch hunt made nuclear physicists work on this project. \"Anyone who's in these roles is probably self-selected to some degree,\" he says. \"They don't mind doing the work. If they were afraid, they could do a million other things. A lot of scientists did this in the Cold War; they said physics has gotten too political.\"The US attempt to send a satellite into space in 1957 failed when the Vanguard rocket exploded on launch (Credit: Getty Images)There may have been more self-examination by the Vietnam War.\"Project A119 reminds me of the segment in The Simpsons when Lisa sees Nelson's 'Nuke the Whales' poster on his wall,\" says, an expert in international relations in outer space. \"And he says, 'Well you've got to nuke something.'\"These were serious studies, but they didn't get any serious funding or attention when they left the space community. It was part of the late 50s, early 60s space mania before anybody knew exactly what nature the Space Age was going to take,\" he says.\"If there is going to be anything resembling this kind of lunar hysteria again it is going to run afoul of the established international legal order\u2026 agreed by almost every state in the world.\"Could these plans surface again, despite the international consensus? \"I've heard some noises coming out from some places and the Pentagon about looking at US Space Force missions for the lunar environment,\" Bowen says.If some of the more outlandish ideas don't find root in the US, that doesn't mean that they couldn't find favour further afield \u2013 such as China. \"I wouldn't be surprised if there's a community in China now wanting to push some of these ideas because they think the Moon is cool, and they work in the military,\" Bowen adds.Most of the details of Project A119 are still shrouded in mystery. Many of the were apparently destroyed.Its ultimate lesson, perhaps, is that we should never gloss over the research paper with the blandly bureaucratic name without, at least, reading it first.--"

        "text": "Madeline HalpertReporting from courtCarroll\u2019s lawyer has attempted to rebut some of Trump's legal team's arguments, including that Ms Carroll could not\nremember the specific date of the alleged rape.Kaplan conceded that Carroll did not know the date, but argued it mattered less because survivors of\ntrauma tend to forget specific details and instead remembered other\nthings, such as sensory memories.This is why Carroll vividly remembers the sound of Trump's heavy breathing\nduring the alleged assault but not how she was able to escape the department\nstore, Kaplan told the court.Carroll\u2019s behaviour was consistent with that of a trauma survivor\nin other respects as well, Ms Kaplan argued.Screaming is an uncommon reaction for victims of\nsexual assault, expert Leslie Lebowitz testified during the trial. This explains why Carroll did\nnot yell during the assault, Kaplan said.Trump\u2019s lawyer, Joe\nTacopina, had repeatedly pressed the former columnist on why she had not\nscreamed.Kaplan said \u201cself blame\u201d kept Carroll from talking about the alleged assault.\u201cIt kept her from going to the police, getting surveillance from\n[Bergdorf Goodman],\u201d she said.Madeline HalpertReporting from courtDuring the first hour of closing arguments, E Jean\nCarroll\u2019s lawyer, Roberta Kaplan, portrayed Carroll as a\ncourageous woman who had been deeply harmed by Trump. She called on the jury to\nhold him accountable for the alleged assault.\u201cNo one, not even a former president, is above the law,\u201d she\nsaid.She argued that Trump had followed the same playbook with\nCarroll that he had laid out in an infamous Access Hollywood recording, in which he\nsaid famous people could \u201cdo anything\u201d to women, including grabbing \u201cwomen by\ntheir [expletive]\".That\u2019s what Trump did to Carroll, Kaplan told the court.\u201cHe kissed [women] without consent, he grabbed them, he did not\nwait,\" she said. \"He grabbed\n[Carroll] by the [expletive].\u201dShe claimed that in doubling down on his Access Hollywood remarks\nduring a video deposition played during the trial, Trump had acted as a\n\u201cwitness against himself\u201d.He did not even \u201cbother\u201d to attend the trial in person and\npresented no witnesses in his defence, she added.Carroll, on the other hand, presented 11 witnesses whom Kaplan argued powerfully corroborated her testimony about both the day of the alleged\nassault and its aftermath.We're about to hear some of the closing arguments, so let's quickly look at the important names that will likely come up.Nada TawfikReporting from courtDonald Trump\u2019s approach to this trial made some wonder if he was treating it with enough seriousness.For one, he never attended court. His lawyer, Joe Tacopina, wanted to tell the jury that his absence was meant to avoid logistical and financial burdens on the city.But the judge shot him down, noting the former president and Republican frontrunner was traveling for campaign events.At another point, Trump was in Scotland opening a golf course.Former federal prosecutor Mitchell Epner says Trump did himself an extraordinary disservice in disrespecting the process by not showing up.Jurors, he added, were giving their time and attention, and expected him to do the same.It wasn\u2019t unusual that Trump chose not to testify, because anything he said could be used against him in other legal cases or investigations.What was surprising though was his and his lawyers\u2019 decision not to call any witnesses or present any evidence in his defense.Pratiksha GhildialReporting from courtThis morning, Judge Lewis Kaplan laid out a timeline for\nwhat the jury can expect during the day.He said Carroll\u2019s lawyers will have about\ntwo hours to make their arguments, while he expects Trump\u2019s side to speak\nfor more than a couple of hours.There will then be a short rebuttal from the\nplaintiff\u2019s side.The judge said he will likely instruct the jury on Tuesday\nmorning, after which they will have the case.The plaintiff\u2019s lawyer Roberta\nKaplan (not related to the judge) has now taken the stand as closing arguments begin.E Jean Carroll has made her way into the New York City courthouse.She will be present as the jury hears closing arguments from both legal teams.Madeline HalpertReporting from courtThe closely watched two-week New York civil rape trial against the former president has been filled with tense exchanges between lawyers and controversial remarks from the former president about women\u2019s bodies.Here are some of the key moments.Ms Carroll, 79, says the attack occurred at a Bergdorf Goodman store in Manhattan in late 1995 or early 1996.The pair had bumped into each other while shopping, she said.Trump then allegedly asked her for advice when buying lingerie for another woman and jokingly asked her to model it for him.But once in the changing rooms, Carroll claimed the real estate tycoon lunged at her, pinned her against a wall and assaulted her.Carroll, whose \"Ask E. Jean\" advice column appeared in Elle magazine from 1993 to 2019, claims she managed to push him off after a \"colossal struggle\".She did not report the alleged encounter to police, her complaint said, because she \"was in shock and did not wish to think of herself as a rape victim\".Two of Carroll's friends, Carol Martin and Lisa Birnbach, have said the writer told them about the alleged incident within days.The jury will deliberate on three things once closing statements wrap.The jury must decide if Donald Trump is liable for battery when he allegedly \u201cforcibly raped and groped\u201d E Jean Carroll, as the lawsuit claims. Carroll\u2019s team must have proved that Trump \u201cintentionally, and without her consent, attacked Carroll to satisfy his own sexual desires\u201d.The jury must decide if Trump\u2019s comments on Truth Social in 2022 October \u201ccontained numerous falsehoods about Carroll\u201d that \u201ccaused Carroll to suffer reputational, emotional, and professional harm\u201d.- In addition to the counts of battery and defamation, the jury will rule if Trump must retract his statements about Carroll and award her with \u201cpunitive and exemplary damages\u201d.A marketing professor told the jury that his post about her caused Carroll damages of an estimated $368,000 (\u00a3290,000) to $2.7m (\u00a32.13m). The jury will also decide an additional sum for damages over the alleged battery.Brandon LivesayLive reporterGood morning and welcome to our live coverage of the E Jean Carroll civil rape and defamation trial against former president Donald Trump.We will hear closing arguments from both legal teams today in what will be a busy hearing at the New York City courtroom.A verdict from the jury is expected tomorrow, but we will be keeping across all developments.Nada Tawfik and Madeline Halpert are in court bringing us the latest updates, alongside US digital reporter Brandon Drenon and myself."

        "text": "\"The fast food, the cheap gas, the fake [breasts] \u2013 there's a shortcut for everything here!\" beams Roman Bellic, the big-hearted immigrant owner of a failing taxi firm. \"You just need to know where it is.\" His first cousin Niko Bellic \u2013 a man who has newly emigrated from the Balkans, and is completely unconvinced by America's abilities to fix their broken lives \u2013 bluntly interjects: \"Yeah, but most people don't know where it is, so they stay at the bottom of the food chain! They stay there until they're burnt out or dead.\"\u2013\u2013\u2013Although this profound exchange occurs in a throwaway side mission about a quarter of the way through Grand Theft Auto IV, it's a perfect reflection of how the 2008 game, now celebrating its 15th anniversary, dared to take the blockbuster gaming franchise (which has sold more than 400 million copies globally) somewhere darker and more political.GTA IV's protagonist Niko Bellic is a survivor of the Balkan wars already disillusioned by life in the US (Credit: Rockstar Games)Started in 1997, the Grand Theft Auto series almost immediately created a name for itself as a nihilistically provocative and crudely satirical pop-culture sensation, in which players took on the roles of urban criminals testing the frameworks of US society as they tried to rise up the ranks of a gangland underworld. Created by Rockstar, a games development studio based in Dundee, Scotland, the GTA games have always been a parody of US excess, with witty in-game jokes on everything from heart attack-inducing burgers to.However, whereas previous GTA games leaned towards toilet humour over sincere messages about the human condition, and lead protagonists tended to be silent assassins addicted to mischief (GTA 3's Claude Speed) or recycled male Hollywood rags-to-riches archetypes (think GTA: Vice City's Scarface-esque Tommy Vercetti), the Niko Bellic character was a bold left turn from developer Rockstar, directly forcing millions to see through the eyes of a jaded immigrant.\u00a0There is a nagging sense throughout the game that Niko is having an existential crisis while committing his miscreant acts (including stealing cars); something shaped by voice actor Michael Hollick's crestfallen delivery. When Niko drives past sex workers, he utters the line: \"You poor wretches!\"Hein cheap tracksuits;a love interest of his PTSD nightmares; and tends to prioritise emotive philosophy (\"War is where the young and stupid are tricked by the old and the bitter into killing each other\") over giddy quips while driving to missions with his co-conspirators. Having fled the Balkan wars, Niko hopes to be re-energised by the bright lights of Liberty City (a fictional re-working of New York City). Yet he quickly discovers that corruption, greed and \"\" are just as prevalent in the so-called land of the free, and that cousin Roman is even being extorted by gangsters.\"When I worked in Sarajevo [the capital of Bosnia and Herzegovina] you could still see the artillery damage, so for all the countries involved in the Yugoslav wars it is something that continued to visibly haunt them,\" Georg Hobmeier, the co-founder of Vienna-based games company Causa Creations, explains to BBC Culture. \"When Niko Bellic was unveiled, it felt so close to home. People in Eastern and Central Europe were very surprised! It felt like video games were stepping outside their comfort zone, and daring to show much more complex, tortured people.\"Causa is the development studio that brought to life 2017's\u2013 an indie game that replicated the dangerous real-life escape route of war-torn Syrian refugee Abdullah Karam and has been used by the United Nationsto help students empathise with refugees and immigrants. According to Hobbmier, GTA IV, which was released on 29 April 2008, helped shift the narrative goal posts, encouraging a generation of developers \u2013 including himself \u2013 to root stories in the vulnerable perspectives of immigrant workers.\"There's a satirical rock song in Bosnia called, which has the lyrics: 'I am from Bosnia Take me to America / I really want to see the Statue of Liberty',\" he tells BBC Culture. \"This song reminds me of GTA IV, because the game similarly [contrasts] the dream promised to immigrants [with] the grim reality that often awaits them when they arrive. Look, GTA IV moved the goalposts. It transformed the field. The introduction of these themes in a project of that size is more important than a small indie game doing it; it's more revolutionary.\"GTA IV helped pave the way for other games focusing on refugees and immigrants, such as 2017's Path Out (Credit: Causa Creations)For fellow developer Florent Maurin, it was just as seminal. Maurin is the founder of games developer The Pixel Hunt, a Paris-based studio responsible for, a game that cleverly immerses players in the heart of a desperate Whatsapp\u00a0conversation between a Syrian refugee on the move to Germany and her husband back in their home country. He points out just how abrupt a shift GTA IV was in tone from its predecessor, 2004's GTA: San Andreas. \"In GTA IV, everything seems more weighted and grounded, from the colour palette to the way the cars actually drive, to the character's animations,\" he opines.\"This makes for a surprisingly heavy and dark experience, to the point that when you encounter the unavoidable silly missions every GTA has to offer, they feel out of place. Niko looks terribly depressed, and you really had to be GTA to 'sell' a hero like that.\"It's a sentiment echoed by John Wills, a professor of American Studies at the University of Kent, who senses GTA IV was a deliberate effort from Rockstar to subvert the cartoonish vibrancy that had previously defined the series and make a story apt for a world that in 2008 was freefalling into a bleak global recession. \"The grey tone of the city is such a contrast to the solar flare of Los Santos/Los Angeles [the setting for GTA: San Andreas], with a real focus on debt, the hard life, and realism,\" he says. \"In GTA games there are enduring themes of the attraction of criminality, the pressure of personal failure, a sense of broader masculine crisis, and an America that consistently disappoints. But the futility of American uplift is more conspicuous and serious in GTA IV.\"Both Maurin and Wills believe this tonal shift was driven by the real world GTA IV was mirroring. In 2005, when the game's development started to take shape, the US migrant population (consisting of legal and illegal immigrants) reached aof 35 million, according to Census Bureau data. And in response to the growth in unauthorised migration and the backlash around it, the US government initiated a heightened militarisation of its borders, with the recently-formed(now know as US Immigration and Customs Enforcement) becoming increasingly powerful. In fact,the National Council of State Legislatures, 570 pieces of legislation dealing with legal and illegal immigrants were introduced in the US in 2006 and at least 1,562 in 2007.When Niko is chased by helicopters in GTA IV after committing one too many crimes, the choppers are branded with a \"'Patriotism and Immigration Authority\" logo, with their pilots shouting phrases: \"Let's tighten the noose!\" The clear suggestion is that Bellic is being hunted by a blood-thirsty border control, rather than the cops.\"Americans were starting to take helicopters to hunt Mexican illegals, and they were aggressively putting barbed wire at their borders [when GTA IV was being made],\" Hobmeier says.\u00a0\"The European borders were militarised too. In the UK, in the mid-2000s, you had people sneaking in through lorries and [shipping] containers. The world of GTA IV mirrors all of this. In the game Niko is literally being hunted by the government.\"Rockstar is famously secretive, and declined to take part in this feature, but in comments from a 2008 interview with its co-founder Dan Houser, he confirmed the idea for GTA IV was to make Niko feel like an illegal alien. \"We wanted someone who felt tough but also like an alien,\" he commented. \"The idea of this immigrant story began to seem fun and interesting and he was a good character. On the one hand he's innocent, on the other he's battle-hardened and world-weary. Right now, a modern 'arriving in America' story feels very interesting to us.\"Yet it would be disingenuous to say Rockstar got absolutely everything right about Niko Bellic's portrayal. The character frequently mispronounces Serbo-Croatian phrases, a by-product of the fact that voice actor Michael Hollick was an American putting on an exaggerated accent, and the game forces him into tiresome \"assimilation\" quests in which he has to take his friends out bowling and drinking to settle him into the US. Above all, critics havethat Niko is merely a generalisation of Eastern European immigrants, which perpetuates harmful stereotypes about this demographic being more susceptible to criminal activity. For Dr Jess Rowan Marcotte, a consultant for Refugee Engagement with Video Games for the United Nations, it was good to see GTA IV centre its narrative around an immigrant story, but it still didn't go far enough.Bury Me, My Love is another game centring the migrant experience, immersing players in a conversation between a Syrian woman and her husband (Credit: The Pixel Hunt/Figs/Arte)\"It is a credit to the writers and creative direction that they chose to try to take into account the fallacies of the American Dream,\" she says. \"That being said, the ramifications of that decision didn't perfectly carry through the rest of the game. Largely, the gameplay and mechanics follow a typical violent GTA game, despite the narrative window dressing.\"So, what exactly is GTA IV's legacy? In many ways it remains the \"outsider\" of the franchise. Its follow up GTA V became the biggest-selling game of all time by reverting back to a more conventional action-adventure story, and switching between three lead characters (Franklin, Michael, and Trevor) who killed gleefully and lacked Niko Bellic's degree of moral conscience. ItGTA IV's sales in the process. This means a darker, riskier storyline like that of Bellic's is unlikely to be repeated, with Rockstar in no rush to release a remastered version of GTA IV, especially after the critical backlash for itsGTA: Vice City, and GTA: San Andreas remasters.Leaks from the upcoming GTA 6 suggest it will feature a new female protagonist, which will at least once again constitute fresh ground for the series. However, Hobmeier would be surprised if the new GTA game takes equivalent narrative risks to the fourth entry, with the 2023 business landscape also more risk-averse than it was back in 2008. \"When we were trying to get publishers interested in Path Out's follow- up, there was some who backed out because the countries they operate in have such an anti-immigrant feeling,\" he says. \"We're in the middle of a culture war right now, and the people with the money will play it safe to protect their investment and avoid cannibalising an audience by telling risky stories. Because of that, it's unlikely GTA IV could be repeated today.\"But wherever the GTA franchise goes next in terms of its societal themes, Wills says GTA IV will only grow in stature. \"A growing cultural divide [over immigration in the West], makes it perhaps more important than ever for games like GTA IV to humanise the immigrant experience, and show how we need to have compassion, not hatred, for all people,\" he says. \"The idea of exploring the outsider is an important one for players to engage with on so many levels. Although the gameplay format of GTA IV, awash with often gratuitous violence, is hardly the best vehicle for this, it at least succeeds in creating compassion.\"For the final mission of GTA IV, Niko Bellic is faced with an impossible choice, which will certainly result in the death of a loved one. The very first thing the character sarcastically says after this mission ends, and he wakes up in his apartment, is: \"So, this is the American Dream? This is the victory we longed for?\" The GTA series has satirised the US many times before, particularly its need to super-size everything and an over-reliance on guns, but The Pixel Hunt's Maurin argues GTA IV was the first entry to truly examine the limitations of The American Dream for those who aren't American.\"Using a character that ran away from war-torn Yugoslavia is still pretty bold in 2023,\" he concludes. \"GTA IV had something deeper to say, something truly nihilistic, and it said it with its story, its ending, its characters, but also with its aesthetics and its overall sadness. It's a game about the impossibility of redemption for some [in America], especially those like Niko Bellic.\""

The villain's glowing eye has also been referenced in the names of a dung beetle, a frog and a dinosaur.The team has also found another butterfly genus, which Dr Huertas has named Argenteria, meaning silver mine, on account of the silver scales on its wings.Blue butterflies to feature in Attenborough seriesUK butterfly sightings worryingly low, experts sayHuge recovery for butterfly once extinct in the UK"

        "name": "Her illness fooled celebs. The truth may be even darker",
        "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-65428918",
        "text": "In 2020, a high-profile children's charity was closed down. Just two years earlier, its young founder had died in mysterious circumstances, leaving everyone involved desperate for answers. Only now is the truth becoming clear - a story of medical deception and celebrity obsession, exposed by a group of concerned parents determined to protect the cancer community from imposters.On 10 August 2015, crowds of fans cheered and waved as two members of pop band One Direction posed for photos outside a fundraising ball at London's Natural History Museum. But inside, the real stars were a group of very ill children - dressed up in gowns and suits, some accompanied by their carers, others midway through chemotherapy.For Megan and her mother Jean, this \"Cinderella Ball\" was another chance to raise money for their fast-growing charity, Believe in Magic. Over the past two years they'd granted hundreds of wishes to seriously ill children, including parties and trips to Disneyland.The guests also knew that Megan - who was just 20 - had organised the ball while very publicly battling a brain tumour of her own. It's an \"incredible privilege\" to work with Believe in Magic, One Direction's Louis Tomlinson told attendees. But behind the ball gowns and themed masks there was a secret involving one of the medical profession's most mysterious syndromes.Believe in Magic was inspired by Megan's own struggle with illness. After her parents separated when she was very young, Megan lived with her mother Jean, sharing a fairly normal suburban life. But aged 13, Megan was diagnosed with Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension - a build-up of pressure on the brain.A couple of years later, Jean told friends Megan had also been diagnosed with a brain tumour. The experience inspired Megan, then 16, to start Believe in Magic, to bring some joy to desperately unwell children.Despite Jean's regular online posts about Megan's daily cocktail of drugs and frequent hospital visits, the pair worked tirelessly for their charity. Megan, Jean, and their charity became famous for their glitzy parties and support of One Direction.\"It was out of this world,\" said Lucy Petagine, whose daughter Luna attended several events. \"Every single child felt like they were so important and they weren't poorly.\"In 2015, Megan was given an award by then-UK Prime Minister David Cameron, who praised her \"extraordinary courage\".At the height of Believe in Magic's success, however, Jean announced Megan's brain tumour had worsened, and she needed to raise \u00a3120,000 for emergency life-saving treatment in the US. Megan's supporters rushed to help and they reached the target in less than 48 hours.But one group of concerned parents in the child cancer community didn't think Megan was as ill as she claimed.When Jo Ashcroft first saw Megan's JustGiving appeal on Facebook in early 2015, it brought back painful memories. After her son was diagnosed with neuroblastoma - a cancer of the nervous system - Jo had raised \u00a3250,000 for successful cutting-edge treatment in the US.Something about Megan's appeal didn't sit right with Jo. It didn't mention any specific doctor or hospital. \"I was a bit suspicious,\" she recalls. \"I just wanted to make sure the money was going to the right place.\"When Jo spoke to three friends whose children had also been diagnosed with neuroblastoma, they agreed it was unusual. But they advised caution - wrongly accusing someone of lying about a brain tumour was unthinkable.Gentle questions to Jean and other supporters went unanswered, so Jo went back to running the family business and looking after her three children. Then, a year later, Jo saw Megan and Jean were fundraising again - Jean said Megan was seriously unwell in hospital in America, and needed more money.Jo and the other concerned parents vowed that this time, they'd uncover the truth. \"It became all-consuming,\" she says. \"I don't want people being ripped off, especially not in the cancer community.\"She adopted a pseudonym and even pretended to be a journalist writing a story about Megan - although again got nowhere. But one of the group used their computer skills to work out where Jean and Megan were opening their emails. It wasn't a hospital. It was a luxury hotel at Disney World in Orlando, Florida.A few weeks later, Megan and her mother Jean disembarked the Queen Mary II ocean liner at Southampton docks.According to Jean, they were lucky to be back at all. Throughout the summer, she'd asked supporters to help her raise money - explaining Megan had \"16 sources of infections\" and severe sepsis. At one point, she said, doctors gave Megan a 10% chance of surviving the next seven days.Thanks to their hard work though, she said, Megan's condition had stabilised and the specialists in Florida had allowed her to return home, armed with five cases of medical kit and a \"huge oxygen concentrator\".But waiting at the cruise terminal as they arrived was a private investigator. Jo was so determined to discover the truth, she paid \u00a31,000 for him to take photos of the pair.The photos showed Megan and Jean walking off the ship like a couple of happy tourists. There were no oxygen tanks. According to the investigator, they were laughing and chatting as they strolled straight past the porters, pushing luggage trollies piled high with cases.We asked Jean via email why she and Megan were staying at a Disney resort at a time they claimed Megan was seriously ill in a US hospital. She did not respond, although said, \"it is very easy to get sucked into social media lies.\"Armed with this new evidence, the concerned parents contacted every authority they could think of, but it seemed like nobody would intervene. So they decided to set up a Facebook group called: \"The Truth About Meg And Jean\" - where they shared their discoveries. But most of Meg and Jean's supporters refused to believe it. Many had seen Megan's poor health first-hand - the intravenous tubes in her arm and medication.Jo was bombarded with hateful messages, but she was confident she'd done the right thing. Then, in early 2018, Jo's phone buzzed. Megan was dead.Megan had died on 28 March 2018 at the National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery in London.\"All I kept saying is, 'Darling, if you want to go, please go and be happy,'\" wrote her mother on Facebook.Jo was stunned. \"It wasn't supposed to end like this,\" she says.For Megan's supporters, there was little doubt who was to blame. \"She was hounded to death,\" wrote one on Facebook. But Jo remained convinced that Megan didn't have a brain tumour.When the cause of someone's death is unclear, a coroner investigates what has happened. In late 2018, an inquest into Megan's death took place.In early 2022, we were granted permission to attend the coroner's court and listen to a recording of what had been heard at the inquest four years earlier.For two hours, we listened to doctors explain what they had seen. Megan had certainly been unwell - over the years she had suffered from several conditions, but all in theory manageable.But the inquest dealt a shocking blow to the claims Megan and Jean had made over the years. Jo was right - there was no mention of a tumour. According to the forensic pathologist, her brain had been \"morphologically normal\".Several doctors however listed other worrying details. One had concerns about the validity of Megan's medical history. Another noted Megan's \"opiate-seeking\" behaviour. There was an attempt to obtain morphine using a forged prescription. Megan repeatedly missed medical appointments and hopped from doctor to doctor.It wasn't a tumour that killed Megan, but an abnormality of the rhythm of the heart - acute cardiac arrhythmia - due to fatty liver disease, likely related to Megan's high body mass index.Jean did not want to be interviewed, but told us via email that Megan did have a pituitary microadenoma - a type of non-cancerous brain tumour which, while not typically life-threatening, can be harmful.Megan had four older half-siblings, Jean's children from a previous marriage. \"I was 12 when Meg was born,\" says Megan's half-sister Kate, whose name we've changed. \"I just adored her.\"According to Kate, Megan and Jean had a strange relationship with illness. If someone they knew was unwell, sooner or later they'd hear Megan had the same.Kate remembers family dinners laced with danger. Jean piled tins precariously on top of empty food cupboards which would roll off and hit the dining table directly below - so often that it was covered in dents and divots.\"Jean wanted one of us to have an accident,\" believes Kate. \"The whole thrill of it. The attention.\"For Megan's other half-sister Rachel - whose name we've also changed - it's even more personal. When she was nine, she was affected by a rash that caused kidney problems. Over the years, her condition deteriorated, and she needed a transplant.After Megan died, Rachel had vivid memories of being fed cups and cups of salty Bovril as a child - even though high salt content is something you should avoid with kidney problems.She now wonders: \"Only I got Bovril. So, was it a deliberate thing?\"In 1951, a physician called Richard Asher published a ground-breaking paper in the medical journal The Lancet. While running a mental observation unit, he noticed a small but consistent number of patients complaining of various symptoms, but on closer inspection were perfectly healthy.He called it \"Munchausen syndrome\". It differs from hypochondria. Hypochondriacs exaggerate and panic, but really do think they're ill. Munchausen patients know they aren't, but seek treatment anyway.Prof Marc Feldman is one of the world's most renowned experts on factitious disorders like Munchausen syndrome. He also studies Munchausen by proxy, now known in the UK as Fabricated or Induced Illness (FII), a rare form of child abuse where a parent or carer exaggerates or deliberately causes symptoms of illness in the child. Because it involves deception, he thinks the condition is more widespread than people realise.Prof Feldman never met Megan or Jean, and hasn't seen Megan's medical records. But based on our detailed account of what we've discovered, he says Megan's case \"screams\" of FII.Megan was 23 when she died, so legally an adult. But she was still a child when the charity was started. We will never know for sure who was driving this behaviour, or what Megan really thought of it all.Feldman explains the line between child and consenting adult might be clear in legal terms - but not always in practice: \"If you learn throughout your whole lifetime that there are certain things you're allowed to say and think\u2026 you become cooperative.\"People fake illness - either in themselves or others - for lots of reasons. Some do it for money. Sometimes it's a wish to be listened to or looked after. For parents, it can be a desire to be the heroic caregiver. Sometimes it's a mixture.For Megan and Jean, one motive might have been to run a much-loved charity - Megan being seen as having a life-threatening brain tumour herself may have helped Believe in Magic reach more children. At a Believe in Magic event at the Tower of London, a former friend recalls Jean observing: \"The sicker Meg is, the more attention we get, the more money we make.\"More recently, Prof Feldman has spotted a new trend - people faking conditions to meet celebrities. A serious condition, he says, \"allows someone to emerge out of the pack of people who are infatuated with this celebrity\".Megan's sister Kate thinks that the brain tumour and Believe in Magic were partly driven by a desire to rub shoulders with celebrities. After repeatedly tweeting members of One Direction, the band became supporters of the charity, allowing Megan and Jean to meet the stars.In 2017 - a year before Megan died - the Charity Commission opened an investigation into Believe in Magic, following several tip-offs from Jo.They found more than \u00a3100,000 was unaccounted for, and that charity money had been transferred into Jean's personal bank account. In 2020, the charity was dissolved and Jean agreed not to be a trustee or in a senior management position in any charity for five years.Just a few months after Believe in Magic was shut down, Jean disappeared from public view. She moved to France for a while, before returning to the UK last year.But that was not the end of the story. In November 2022, Kingston Council - where Megan had been living - published a \"Safeguarding Adult Review\" into what had happened. These are rare investigations into cases where people may have been let down by the authorities. As is standard, the names are all changed, but because of how much we've learned about the case, we have no doubt it's about Megan.It concluded: \"Despite there being no formal diagnosis of FII (Fabricated or Induced Illness) in this case, the presentation and coroner's conclusion lead all involved to think it was likely to have been FII.\"This review does not suggest that FII caused Megan's death. It cites the cause of death given in the coroner's inquest: cardiac arrhythmia, due to fatty liver disease. But it nevertheless highlights how the FII in Megan's case could have been missed.FII is recognised as something that can happen to children, because parents attend their medical appointments, and are responsible for giving consent for treatments. There's far less understanding about how it can happen to vulnerable adults too. Because Megan was an adult for much of this story, doctors and social workers lacked the training and tools to identify her situation as a case of FII while she was still alive.We asked Jean to respond to the findings of the Kingston review. She did not directly address what was found, but did say: \"I loved and cared for my daughter. Suggesting I might have harmed her in any way at all is absolutely sickening.\"It's too late for Megan, but according to FII expert Dr Danya Glaser, this review could change how similar cases are understood and managed.\"The Kingston review is extremely significant,\" she explained. \"It brings to people's attention the fact that FII can continue into adulthood.\"A few days after the review was published, we visited Kate and Rachel to tell them about it - even Megan's sisters had no idea it had taken place. Neither have spoken to their mother for several years. When they asked her difficult questions about Megan and Believe in Magic, Jean cut them out of her life, they say.\"It's a good thing to have. It's all there in black and white,\" says Rachel, reading the report. \"We thought it had all been forgotten.\" She thinks back to her kidney transplant and wonders what this report means for her too.They both hope it might help prevent something similar happening again.\"Megan was a victim,\" says Kate. \"She was groomed for this.\""

The prime minister and his wife hosted an event at Downing Street yesterday, for dignitaries, community figures and youth groups.He is asked about the arrests of anti-monarchy protesters in London on Saturday. Sunak says the police are independent of government, and that they made the decisions they deemed best. The PM adds that he was grateful to the police for their \"hard work\".Sunak's Conservative Party lost more than 1,000 councillors during last week's local elections in England. Asked about the results, the prime minister says it's \"always disappointing\" to lose hard-working councillors - but insists he will stick to the Tory party's core pledges.Some more pictures of Princess of Wales and her children taking part in a volunteering drive in Slough have been released."

        "name": "The jobs AI won't take yet",
        "link": "https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20230507-the-jobs-ai-wont-take-yet",
        "text": "Since the start of the industrial revolution, there have been threats that new machines \u2013 fromto\u2013 would usurp human jobs. For the most part, the humans have prevailed. Now, say some experts, with AI ubiquity on the horizon, the threat\u2019s being realized: the robots really are coming for some jobs.A March 2023 report from Goldman Sachs estimated thatcurrently done by humans. Across the European Union and US, the report further notes, 300 million jobs could be lost to automation. And that could be dire, says Martin Ford, author of Rule of the Robots: How Artificial Intelligence Will Transform Everything.\u201cIt's not just that this would happen to individuals, but it could be pretty systemic,\u201d he says. \u201cIt could happen to a lot of people, potentially quite suddenly, potentially all at the same time. And that has implications not just for those individuals, but for the whole economy.\u201dThankfully, it\u2019s not all bad news. The experts issue their warnings with a caveat: there are still things AI isn\u2019t capable of \u2013 tasks that involve distinctly human qualities, like emotional intelligence and outside-the-box thinking. And moving into roles that centre those skills could help lessen the chances of being replaced.\u201cI think there are generally three categories that are going to be relatively insulated in the foreseeable future,\u201d says Ford. \u201cThe first would be jobs that are genuinely creative: you\u2019re not doing formulaic work or just rearranging things, but you're genuinely coming up with new ideas and building something new.\u201dWhile a robot may ostensibly provide a faster diagnosis, patients will still want humans to guide and educate them (Credit: Getty Images)That doesn\u2019t necessarily mean all jobs that are considered \u2018creative\u2019 are safe. In fact, things like graphic design and visual art-related roles may be among the first to go; basic algorithms can direct a bot to analyse millions of images, allowing AI to master aesthetics instantly. But there\u2019s some security in other kinds of creativity, says Ford: \u201cin science, and medicine and law \u2026 people whose job is coming up with a new legal strategy or business strategy. I think that there's going to continue to be a place there for human beings\u201d.The second insulated category, he continues, is jobs that require sophisticated interpersonal relationships. He points to nurses, business consultants and investigative journalists. These are jobs, he says, \u201cwhere you need a very deep understanding of people. I think it\u2019ll be a long time before AI has the ability to interact in the kinds of ways that really build relationships\u201d.The third safe zone, says Ford, \u201care jobs that really require lots of mobility and dexterity and problem-solving ability in unpredictable environments\u201d. Many trade jobs \u2013 think electricians, plumbers, welders and the like \u2013 fall under this umbrella. \u201cThese are the kinds of jobs where you're dealing with a new situation all the time,\u201d he adds. \u201cThey are probably the hardest of anything to automate. In order to automate jobs like this, you would need a science fiction robot. You\u2019d need Star Wars\u2019s C-3PO.\u201dWhile humans will likely remain in jobs that fall within those categories, that doesn\u2019t mean those professions are totally insulated from the ascent of AI. In fact, says Joanne Song McLaughlin, associate professor of labour economics at the University of Buffalo, US, most jobs, regardless of industry, have aspects that are likely to be automated by the technology.\u201cIn many cases, there\u2019s no immediate threat to jobs,\u201d she says, \u201cbutwill change.\u201d Human jobs will become more focused on interpersonal skills, continues Song McLaughlin. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to imagine that, for instance, AI will detect cancers way better than humans could. In the future, I\u2019m assuming doctors will use that new technology. But I don\u2019t think the doctor\u2019s whole role will be replaced.\u201dTrade jobs and jobs that require a great deal of mobility are more likely to be insulated from automation (Credit: Getty Images)While a robot may ostensibly do a better job of finding cancer, she says, most people will still want a doctor \u2013 a real person \u2013 to be the one to tell them about it. That\u2019s true of almost all jobs, she adds, and so developing those distinctly human skills could help people learn to do their jobsAI.\u201cI think it\u2019s smart to really think, \u2018what kind of tasks within my job will be replaced, or will be better done by computer or AI? And what's my complementary skill?\u2019\u201d She points to bank tellers, who once had to be very accurate money counters. Now, that task has been automated \u2013 but there\u2019s still a place for the teller. \u00a0\u201cThe task of money counting became obsolete because of a machine,\u201d she says. \u201cBut now, the tellers are more focused on connecting with customers and introducing new products. The social skill has become more important.\u201dIt\u2019s important to note, says Ford, that an advanced education or a high-paying position is not a defence against AI takeover. \u201cWe might think the person in the white-collar job is higher on the food chain than someone who drives a car for a living,\u201d he says. \u201cBut the white-collar employee\u2019s future is more threatened by the Uber driver, because we still don\u2019t have self-driving cars, but AI can certainly write reports. In many cases, more educated workers are going to be more threatened than then even the least educated workers. Think of the person that works cleaning hotel rooms \u2013 it's really hard to automate that job.\u201dIn short, seeking roles in dynamic, shifting environments that include unpredictable tasks is good way to stave off job loss to AI. At least, for a while."

King, country and Commonwealth.\"King Charles and Queen Camilla - colour-coordinated in blue, with the Queen in a royal blue jumpsuit - smiled and waved their own flags during the evening.The Princess of Wales attended with her and William's oldest children, Prince George and Princess Charlotte. Prince Louis, who has just turned five, stayed at home after his busy day at the Coronation on Saturday.The Duke and Duchess of Edinburgh were seated near the King and Queen, with Prime Minister Rishi Sunak behind them. Prince Andrew, Duke of York, and his ex-wife the Duchess of York, Sarah Ferguson, also attended, as did Zara Tindall and her husband Mike.The crowd of 20,000 people got their tickets in a public ballot, with many more watching performances from stars including Katy Perry and Take That on BBC One and BBC Radio 2.The BBC said on Monday that the concert was watched by an average of 10.1 million, according to overnight figures.The event had a peak audience of 12.3 million, the corporation said.Host Hugh Bonneville - the Paddington and Downton Abbey actor - addressed the royal guests as the show began and acknowledged the King's love of the arts, joking he was \"the artist formerly known as prince\".The concert featured musical acts including maestro Andrea Bocelli and Sir Bryn Terfel collaborating on You'll Never Walk Alone, and Olly Murs, who sang Dance with Me Tonight, while there were also spoken word pieces amidst the music.Cold Feet actor James Nesbitt performed work by poet Daljit Nagra, while fashion designer Stella McCartney spoke about conservation.There were video cameos from a range of stars, including British acting legend Joan Collins, former James Bond actor Pierce Brosnan, artist Tracey Emin and Welsh singer Tom Jones - all of them recounting little-known facts about the monarch.And Top Gun actor Tom Cruise delivered a video message from his War Bird plane, saying: \"Pilot to pilot. Your Majesty, you can be my wingman any time,\" before saluting and banking off.The King seemed to enjoy a skit involving Bonneville and Muppet Show stars Kermit and Miss Piggy, in which Miss Piggy said \"King Charlesy Warlesy\" was expecting them in the royal box.At the end of the show, Kermit was seen to have made it to the box, waving a flag in front of Prince Edward but there was no sign of Miss Piggy.This video can not be playedWatch: Colourful drone display lights up the sky at Coronation concertThe Royal Shakespeare Company, Royal Ballet, Royal College of Art, Royal College of Music and the Royal Opera also took part in the show.The royal patronages came together for the first time, with a one-off performance from Romeo and Juliet featuring actor Ncuti Gatwa - the new star of Doctor Who - and Olivier Award nominee Mei Mac.Members of the Royal Family were seen dancing and singing along to Lionel Richie's All Night Long - with even the King getting to his feet, as did the Duke and Duchess of Edinburgh, Edward and Sophie, and Zara and Mike Tindall.William's speech on stage came immediately after Richie's performance - with the prince referring to the US singer-songwriter's hit, saying: \"I won't go on all night long\", which drew a laugh from his father.In his speech, William thanked everyone for making it \"such a special evening\" before turning to the significance of the weekend.\"As my grandmother said when she was crowned, coronations are a declaration of our hopes for the future,\" he said. \"And I know she's up there, fondly keeping an eye on us. She would be a proud mother.\"For all that celebrations are magnificent, at the heart of the pageantry is a simple message. Service.\"He said that after entering Westminster Abbey for Saturday's service, the first words spoken by his father were his pledge to continue to serve.The prince praised the King for warning about damage to the environment \"long before it was an everyday issue\", and for his work with the Prince's Trust, the charity Charles set up which supports young people.\"Perhaps most importantly of all, my father has always understood that people of all faiths, all backgrounds, and all communities, deserve to be celebrated and supported,\" he said.\"Pa, we are all so proud of you.\"The prince gave his thanks to those who serve \"in the forces, in classrooms, hospital wards and local communities\" before offering his own vow of service.He finished by saying \"God save the King\", which was repeated loudly by the crowd before the national anthem was sung.It was a tender and heartfelt message from William. There was an element of taking on the baton here too.At last year's Platinum Jubilee concert it was Charles who as Prince of Wales gave thanks to his mother. Now it was William as Prince of Wales who gave the vote of thanks, stepping into the role of heir.The stage, in Windsor Castle, resembled the union jack with catwalks jutting out from the centre creating multiple levels for the 70-piece orchestra and band.Singer Paloma Faith sang as landmarks around the UK were lit up in celebration - including Blackpool Tower, Edinburgh Castle and Wales Millennium Centre in Cardiff.And there was the first multi-location drone show to be staged in the UK, with 1,000 drones in formation: a Welsh dragon, spanning 140m, was seen in Cardiff, while a watering can was seen over the Eden Project in Cornwall.Take That closed the show with Never Forget - with the choristers of St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle, singing the song's introduction.King and Queen say thanks for 'glorious occasion'King's Coronation watched by more than 18 millionThe Coronation concert and street parties in pictures"

        "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-65425416",
        "text": "The Prime Minister of a Caribbean nation has told the BBC his country is \"not totally free\" as long as King Charles III remains head of state.Dr Terrance Drew said that a public consultation on whether St Kitts and Nevis should become a republic would begin during his leadership.He also said he would welcome an apology from the monarchy for its historic links to the slave trade.Buckingham Palace told the BBC the King takes slavery \"profoundly seriously\".Last monthinto the relationship between the British monarchy and the transatlantic slave trade, when millions of African men, women and children were shipped to the Americas for use as slaves from the 16th to 19th Centuries.Speaking to the BBC in the St Kitts and Nevis capital Basseterre, Dr Drew described the research as a positive move.\"I think that acknowledging that... something wrong was done, acknowledging it and apologising for it, is a step in the right direction,\" he said.After being approached for comment, Buckingham Palace said the King previously pledged to deepen his understanding of slavery's impact. \"That learning process has continued with vigour and determination since His Majesty's Accession,\" it read.The statement also added that the monarch \"has long acknowledged the discussion about constitutional arrangements\", and referred to a speech to Commonwealth leaders last year when King Charles III said: \"I want to say clearly, as I have said before, that each member's constitutional arrangement, as republic or monarchy, is purely a matter for each member country to decide.\"Last year. Prime Minister Mark Rutte said slavery should be recognised as \"a crime against humanity\".St Kitts and Nevis were the first Caribbean islands that English colonisers permanently settled. Locals still refer to the dual island federation as the \"mother colony\".Built upon sugar and slavery, it's a legacy that lingers today. And if there is one place that illustrates St Kitts and Nevis' colonial past, it's Brimstone Hill Fortress.Designed by the British starting in the 17th Century, it was built and maintained by enslaved Africans.King Charles visited Brimstone Hill back in 2019. Local historian Leonard Stapleton also gave the monarch a tour of the island while he was visiting.\"It was very exciting,\" Leonard told the BBC. \"I still feel proud, having been tasked with that important job.\"The historian's respect and affection for the Royal Family are clear. But he's also aware that symbols matter.While he said the Royal Family are \"kind and genuine human beings\" in person, the Crown \"represents the same force that was behind the enslavement of Africans.\"Leonard Stapleton believes it is time to update some of the language of governance in St Kitts and Nevis.\"One of the things that kind of irks us as a people is when our leaders are being sworn in, we still hear them swear allegiance to the King or the Queen and their heirs and successors,\" he said. \"We definitely want to move to the point where we can swear allegiance to our own beliefs, our constitution.\"But he remains hopeful. \"I do believe that King Charles is going to do something positive about past injustices. I am very confident. As I've said, I've met him.\"Both the King and the Prince of Wales have previously expressed personal sadness about slavery.Speaking during a trip to Rwanda last year, then-Prince Charles said he could not describe \"the depths of his personal sorrow\" at the suffering caused by the slave trade.Prime Minister Dr Terrance Drew also spoke to the BBC about the issue of slavery reparations - meaning some form of compensation offered to the descendants of enslaved Africans, which could include formal apologies, cash payments to individuals, or cancellation of national debt for certain countries.\"We are not just speaking about a monetary contribution, because we are not acting like victims,\" he said.\"It is about real changes even within the systems that are still affecting people of African descent in negative ways.\"During then-Prince Charles's royal visit to Barbados in 2021, Buckingham Palace said that the issue of reparations was a political matter for individual governments to address.There is widespread support throughout the Caribbean for compensation for the descendants of enslaved Africans. A strong indication of that support was highlighted by.Caricom is an inter-governmental organisation of 15 member states including Barbados, Jamaica, the Bahamas and St Kitts and Nevis.The main aim of the 10-point plan is to achieve reparatory justice for the descendants of enslaved Africans - including cash payments, development funding, and full, formal apologies. In 2014, it was unanimously approved by Caricom members.At times demands for reparations have been met with unease. A common point of contention for some is whether descendants of enslaved Africans should be compensated now, given slavery ended almost 200 years ago.But those in favour point to the fact that slave owners were compensated, while the enslaved and their descendants were not.In 2015 British taxpayers finished paying off the debt which the government incurred to compensate British slave owners after abolition in 1833.In recent years, royal tours to Caribbean countries have also intensified the debate around reparations. The day before the then Duke and Duchess of Cambridge arrived in the Bahamas in March 2022, the National Reparations Committee in the Bahamas released a letter calling for Britain to pay reparations for the slave trade.Niambi Hall-Campbell Dean is the committee's chair and a psychologist. She also welcomes the news that King Charles is supporting a study into the Royal Family's links to the slave trade.But she thinks that \"the information that we all know is enough for the Crown to make a full and formal apology, rather than the statement of regret that we have come to be familiar with.\"\"In the Bahamas, and the Caribbean, slavery ended, and colonisation came in. We went from being enslaved to [being] British citizens,\" she told the BBC.\"So we had to fill in those gaps, fill in those spaces with the culture of someone that was different from us, and the culture of someone that enslaved us.\"For Niambi, reparations are about justice, saying sorry, but also about donating money - to public health programmes, national debt, and historical research.Her views are not shared by the British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak. In April Mr Sunak refused to formally apologise for the UK's historic role in the slave trade, telling the House of Commons, \"trying to unpick our history is not the right way forward\".But Niambi believes reparations are important for the descendants of both slave owners and enslaved Africans.\"The perpetrator requires healing,\" she said. \"You can't commit a crime\u2026 and just keep it a secret, and think that secret will not affect how you live your life.\"Each time Britain's links to the slave trade come back under the spotlight, the debate around reparations intensifies.But reaching a general consensus of agreement regarding any next steps appears to be a long way off.King backs study into Royal Family slavery linksWhy Grenada wanted to talk to royals about slaveryWilliam expresses 'profound sorrow' over slavery"

        "text": "A 27-year-old electrical engineering student has died trying to fix the power at a hospital affected by the fighting in Sudan's Darfur region.Muhammedin Fadul Idris Wadi, known to his friends as Ala Danedn, was electrocuted at Sayed al-Shahada Health Centre in Fasher city on Thursday.He was part of a group volunteers trying to keep the clinic going amid fierce clashes and looting.\"He was known for his smile, even in the time of the war,\" his friend said.\"He gave his life as a servant of the people of Fasher,\" Ahmed Ishaq, who studied with him at the University of Fasher, told the BBC.Ala Danedn was admired for his tireless work and selfless community initiatives, he said.A tag line accompanying his profile photo on Facebook reads: \"Don't wait for the opportunity, create it.\"Since the conflict broke out in Sudan between rival military factions on 15 April, his group of volunteers, called the Youth of the al-Thawra Initiative, have been focused on assisting medics in Fasher, the capital of North Darfur state.All medical facilities in Fasher, except South Hospital - a repurposed maternity clinic - had to close because of their proximity to the fighting, or the inability of staff to reach them.\"I saw him working with all effort to clean and receive the wounded in South Hospital throughout the first week,\" said Mr Ishaq.\"He kept us buoyant psychologically in difficult times with his kind words - and he worked like a bee.\"The volunteers then turned their attention to the Sayed al-Shahada Health Centre, which had been damaged and looted and subsequently abandoned by staff.They felt it was important to try and reopen it given its proximity to vulnerable neighbourhoods in the south of the city including Abu Shanbat and Zam Zam camps, which are home to communities who fled their villages in the ethnic violence that ravaged Darfur 20 years ago.His group raised money to organise for the facility to be refurbished and buy food, medicine and other medical supplies.\"He was good at networking with pharmacies and medical supplies companies,\" Mr Ishaq said of his friend's dedication to see the health centre reopen.The clinic started operating again last Monday with the help of 25 volunteer medics and 80 community volunteers, but was still facing difficulties.With many places cut off from electricity - or having an erratic supply - Ala Danedn had been attending to an electric problem at the health centre on Thursday evening.His friend said he collapsed after receiving a strong shock and was transferred to South Hospital.But after 48 hours volunteers there were unable to save him and the undergraduate died on Saturday night.\"We had promised one another that after the war ended that we would meet once again in the city centre, replacing the sounds of bullets with melody, music and joy - sessions he loved,\" Mr Ishaq said.\"But Ala Danedn is gone and we owe it to him to keep our covenant as volunteers to make life better for our people.\"The fighting that erupted three weeks ago is devastating the country - hundreds of civilians have died and hundreds of thousands have fled their homes.The army and the paramilitary group, the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), are continuing to fight for control of key areas of the capital, Khartoum, despite attempts to get the two sides to talk.Around seven million people are trapped in their homes in Khartoum, unable to get basic supplies including food.Envoys from the army and RSF have started talks about a short-term ceasefire in the Saudi Arabian city of Jeddah, according to Saudi officials.

They were held in solitary confinement for the first two months and denied access to a lawyer, it said.In 2021, the Arak Criminal Court convicted Mr Mehrad and Mr Fazeli-Zare on blasphemy charges and sentenced them to death, HRANA added. They were also given six-year prison sentences for \"running groups to act against national security\".The Supreme Court rejected their appeals against the verdicts and upheld their death sentences later that year, Mizan said, adding that both men had \"clearly confessed to their crimes\".Human rights group say Iranian courts regularly fall far short of providing fair trials and use false \"confessions\" obtained under torture as evidence.\"The execution of Yousef and Sadrollah for 'insulting the Prophet' is not only a cruel act by a medieval regime, it is also a serious insult to the freedom of expression,\" said Mahmood Amiry-Moghaddam, director of Norway-based group Iran Human Rights.\"These executions must be a turning point in the relations between the Islamic Republic and countries respecting the freedom of expression,\" he added. \"Lack of a strong reaction by the international community sends a green light to the Islamic Republic and their ideological allies worldwide.\"On Saturday, a Swedish-Iranian dual national accused of being behind a deadly attack on a military parade in 2018 was hanged. The European Union condemned \"in the strongest terms\"Iran is second only to China in the number of executions carried out annually.It has put to death more than 200 people since the start of this year, according to a tally by Iran Human Rights.The group has said the number of executions rose by 75% to 582 last year, as authorities sought to \"spread fear\" among those taking part in the nationwide protests sparked by the death in custody of Mahsa Amini in September.Iran executes Swedish-Iranian for alleged terrorismIran executions surged to 'spread fear' - reportWidespread outrage after British-Iranian executed"

        "text": "Eight people have been killed in the US state of Texas after a car struck a group at a bus stop close to a shelter for the homeless and migrants.The incident happened in the city of Brownsville near the Mexican border at about 08:30 local time (14:30 GMT).At least five other people have been injured, some of them critically.The driver has been arrested and charged. Brownsville police say it is not clear whether the incident was intentional.Police are still investigating whether the attack was deliberate or accidental, and whether the driver - who has not yet been publicly identified - was under the influence of drugs and alcohol.In a Facebook post, Brownsville Mayor Trey Mendez said that the driver has \"thus far been uncooperative\" with investigators.A police department spokesman told the New York Times that police are also looking into reports that the driver shouted anti-migrant remarks.He spoke to police officers in both English and Spanish, gave various names and refused to submit to a breathalyser test, the spokesman added.Video reportedly taken at the scene appears to show the driver being restrained by police officers and taken to a waiting vehicle. In the video - which cannot be independently verified by the BBC - the driver is shirtless and wearing boots coloured like the flag of Texas.Local authorities will hold a news conference at 1130 Est (1530 GMT) on Monday.The director of the nearby Bishop Enrique San Pedro Ozanam Center, Victor Maldonado, told the BBC World Service's Newshour programme that surveillance footage showed an SUV running a red light and approaching the bus stop at speed.The vehicle then hit the curb and flew about 200ft (60m) - hitting those in its path.Mr Maldonado said that roughly half an hour before the incident, a group of around 20 people who had been staying at the centre left and walked over to wait at the bus stop. He earlier told the Associated Press that most of the victims were Venezuelan men.Some had been intending to catch a local bus downtown to link up with other buses heading to different parts of the US, for which they already had tickets.\"All the staff and myself, we're trying to hold it together,\" Mr Maldonado said tearfully.\"A lot of the folks that we have here are mums with kids, and single males. Right in front of their eyes, they were witnessing a tragedy.\"He added that he had not witnessed any hostility towards migrants in the city but is quoted telling KRGV-TV, a local media outlet, that people had come to the gate since the incident and told the security guard the reason it had happened \"was because of us\".According to US border protection officials, the city of Brownsville has recently seen a sharp increase in illegal migrant arrivals.Mr Maldonado also told local media, quoted by AP, that in the past two months the Ozanam Center, an overnight shelter that can hold up to 250 people, has been handling up to 380 people a day.Officials in Brownsville issued a disaster declaration last month, following other Texas border cities that have done the same.That's ahead of an anticipated influx of migrants due tothat allowed the US to automatically expel undocumented migrants.What is the Trump-era Title 42 immigration policy?Officials looking into Texas mall gunman's ideologyTexas shooting suspect captured after tip-off"

The casualties included women and children on school holiday.At least four people who were taken to hospital are in critical condition, said Kerala's sports and fisheries minister, V Abdurahiman.The exact number of missing passengers was not immediately clear. Authorities said they were investigating the cause of the accident and are looking into whether the boat had a proper permit.Shameer, a lifeguard involved in the rescue operation, toldthat \"the boat was completely upside down\" when rescuers arrived at the scene. \"I recovered four bodies and none of them had life jackets on.\"Many of the other passengers were also not wearing life jackets at the time of the incident, survivors told local media.Ambika, a resident of the nearby Tanur area,that when she first saw the boat approach, everyone seemed to be \"cheering happily\".\"But suddenly the lights went out, the boat sank and the cheers were replaced with screams for help,\" she said.Ms Ambika added that she immediately called the police for help. \"But we could not do anything beyond that because it was getting dark and there was no way to reach the passengers.\"Boat accidents are not infrequent in India where vessels are often overcrowded, poorly maintained and lack safety equipment.Ethnic clashes in Indian state leave dozens deadWhat went wrong with India\u2019s Go First airline?Toxic gas leak kills 11 in Indian cityIndian 'killer' elephant relocated to tiger reserve"

        "name": "'Like a kidnapping': Migrant family separated under Trump reunited after four years",
        "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-64959802",
        "text": "This video can not be playedThe sound of migrant children separated from parentsJose Luis Martinez still remembers the screams of his three daughters after US border officials took them away and sent him to a detention centre.\"They were crying and crying,\" he said. \"Their mother had already died. All they wanted was their daddy. I was the only thing they had.\"It was just after midnight on 2 November, 2018. Mr Martinez and his children had travelled over 2,000 miles (3,200 kilometres) by bus from their home country of Honduras, on a 15-day journey to the Texas border in an attempt to enter the US to seek asylum. The girls were then aged 10, 12 and 14.For a month, Mr Martinez asked US officials over and over when he would be able to see his daughters again. He got no answers.The US government eventually deported Mr Martinez back to Honduras, alleging he crossed into the US illegally. It would be nearly four years before he was finally reunited with his children in the US, where they were living with his mother and sister.\"They would call me and say 'Daddy, daddy, why'd you turn around? And I had to tell them I was deported,\" Mr Martinez told the BBC through a translator. \"It was so hard.\"Between 2017 and 2021, former President Donald Trump's administration separated at least 3,900 children - some only a few months old - from their parents along the US-Mexico border under what it called a \"zero-tolerance\" policy.The policy was aimed at discouraging migrants from crossing into the US, and allowed the Justice Department to prosecute and deport adults who crossed the border illegally, placing their children in government custody.The children, mostly from Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador, spent days in detention centres, where some were crowded into metal cages without access to showers and adequate food.Hundreds of children had to wait years, some more than half of their lives, in the US in foster-care settings and with relatives and friends before seeing their immediate families again.US President Joe Biden officially rescinded the zero-tolerance policy within days of taking office. A month later, he established the Family Reunification Task Force to undo what he called the \"moral and national shame\" of the separations.Previously, most parents were forced to choose between having their child return to live with them in the home country they had fled, or leaving them behind in the US. But under the Biden administration's new policy, parents who had been deported, like Mr Martinez, were reunited with their children in the US and allowed to remain in the country for three years.As of March 2023, the US government said 2,969 children who had been separated from parents under the Trump administration have been reunited with family in the US, including some who were reunited during Mr Trump's tenure.But on the five-year anniversary of the day the policy was announced, nearly 1,000 children are still waiting,.Activists say the Trump administration did not maintain thorough databases or records linking parents' information to their children, which several reports from,and other outlets have also revealed. As a result, Mr Biden's officials inherited a \"disaster\", said Lisa Frydman, the vice president of international programs at Kids In Need of Defense (KIND), another organisation involved in contacting migrant families.Non-profit groups in the US and beyond have stepped in to help with what can amount to an international missing persons hunt, with few clues and painfully high stakes.Armed sometimes with only outdated phone numbers, the organisations occasionally send human rights workers out looking for parents in remote villages in countries across Central America.\"It's been dangerous, time-consuming, resource-intensive and made that much more difficult during Covid,\" said Lee Gelernt with the National Immigrants' Rights Project at the American Civil Liberties Union, one of several organisations leading efforts to help contact families.When the US-based groups need on-the-ground support, they call on people like Rebeca Sanchez Ralda, a Guatemala City lawyer and human rights worker with Justice In Motion.She and her co-workers have spent hours poring over civil registries and Facebook profiles to find hints of parents' whereabouts, sometimes with only a common last name to go on.Many of the people they're looking for live in remote villages and speak indigenous languages that US workers do not often speak. When the human rights workers get a tip, the journey can be long and complex. Ms Sanchez Ralda said she'd spent entire mornings walking on treacherous roads to reach isolated communities.When she finally tracks down parents who have had children taken away, they usually don't believe at first that they could get them back. Many parents, she said, have developed a profound distrust of the US government and are wary of receiving help.But for families who are able to reunite, it's a joy, she said. \"Many of them never thought they would see them again,\" she said.Non-profit organisations have located about 1,500 families since 2018, Mr Gelernt estimated.But some of the advocates told the BBC they were worried US immigration policy decisions could lead to more family separations.The Biden administration has taken a host of actions to try to deter an influx of illegal migrants at the border, especially in anticipation of the expiration of the Trump administration's Title 42 policy, which gave the government power to automatically expel undocumented migrants to their country or the last country they were in, most often Mexico.In February, for instance, Biden officials said they would consider migrants who did not seek protections in the first country they passed through on their way to the US border as \"ineligible\" for asylum, with very few exceptions. Additionally, migrants caught crossing illegally will be barred from re-entering the US for at least five years.Then,in March that the Biden administration was considering reinstating in May a Trump-era practice of detaining migrant families with their children if they enter the US illegally, a measure Mr Biden had halted on taking office.Though the practice is different from Mr Trump's zero-tolerance policy, advocates are concerned it could lead to de-facto family separations, motivating parents to send their children to the border alone, since unaccompanied minors can be released from government custody to live with family or other sponsors in the US.\"Implementation of this policy would be disastrous,\" said Jennifer Podkul, KIND's vice president of policy and advocacy.The White House did not respond to a request for comment on whether it was considering the measure.Non-profit leaders argue much more work needs to be done to help families heal from the trauma of separation.Some parents who have had to leave their child in the US have attempted suicide, racked with guilt and confusion about why their child was taken from them, said Cathleen Caron, the founder of Justice in Motion, a migrant rights organisation working in Mexico and northern Central America.For the children, she said, there's bed wetting, nightmares and \"deep trauma\".Some, who were as young as a year old when they were separated, don't even remember their parents when they are reunited, Mr Gelernt said. He remembers a four-year-old boy, one of the first families the ACLU helped reunite, who kept asking his parents if someone was going to come and take him away in the middle of the night.Others now refuse to speak their indigenous languages or eat the food their families prepare for them, Ms Sanchez Ralda said.\"People have no idea the damage this has caused,\" she said. \"It was like a kidnapping.\"Advocates say families need more financial and legal support from the US government to help them recover once they've been reunited with their children in the US, as many lack access to consistent housing.In 2021, the Biden administration was negotiating with families to pay them as much as $1bn (\u00a3790m) total in compensation for the separations, in response to a separate lawsuit filed by the ACLU, but those discussions reportedly broke down after backlash from Republicans.And while Biden's task force has reunited families, their three-year parole status in the US leaves them in a precarious situation, said Ms Caron. She noted some families could face deportation after that time or the possibility of another family separation, if the children have been able to establish a way to stay in the country while their parents are deported.\"When you don't feel that you're safe, it's very hard to heal,\" Ms Caron said.For Mr Martinez, the journey to being reunited with his daughters - now 14, 16 and 18 - has proved bittersweet.\"I was very happy to know that I could be there and that I could at least start helping them from the moment that I got there, but it was also very painful for everything that we suffered,\" he said.For his girls, the news that they would see their father again evoked pure, uncontainable joy, according to their former lawyer, Anilu Chadwick.\"They started crying and screaming. I wanted to scream, too,\" she said. \"The wash of relief was just instantaneous.\"Mr Martinez and his girls now live with his mother and sister in New York City. He said he dreams of building a home for them in Honduras one day so they can all have a place to be together there, too.The 54-year-old father said after four years away from his daughters, their gentle and loving personalities have not changed. But the pain of their time apart has left an indelible mark, he said.\"It's incurable.\" he said. \"It's never going to go away. It's going to remain in the hearts of each of them.\"1,500 US troops to be deployed to US-Mexico borderMigrant children 'held in cages' in TexasWho decided to separate immigrant families in the US?Trump reverses migrant separation policy"

Three of the injured - ranging in age from 5 to 61 - are still in hospitalAwere among those killed.The gunman, named by investigators as Mauricio Garcia, used an AR-15 style rifle and wore combat tactical gear during the shooting, with multiple rounds of ammunition found on him.Witnesses described scenes of panic and horror when the gunman got out of his car in a mall parking lot and began firing on shoppers.During the attack the killer wore a clothing patch with the letters RWDS, which stands for \"Right Wing Death Squad\".This is a phrase popular among right-wing extremists and white supremacy groups.One line of enquiry is whether he was motivated by these ideals and whether he had links to like-minded people, a law enforcement source told CBS.The shooting comes days after five people were killed elsewhere in Texas following a dispute with a neighbour. And on Sunday one person was killed and two injured in a shooting on a train in Dallas.There have been 201 mass shootings this yearwhich defines such incidents as four people injured or killed.President Joe Biden described the rampage as \"the latest act of gun violence to devastate our nation\", and called for Congress to pass tougher gun laws.He confirmed that children were among those killed, saying that \"too many families have empty chairs at their dinner tables\".The Republican governor of Texas, Gregg Abbott, told Fox News Sunday his aim was to target the possession of weapons by criminals and deal with a rising mental health crisis, rather than consider wider bans.\"People\u00a0want\u00a0a\u00a0quick\u00a0solution,\"\u00a0he\u00a0said.\u00a0\"The\u00a0long\u00a0term\u00a0solution\u00a0here\u00a0is\u00a0to\u00a0address\u00a0the\u00a0mental\u00a0health\u00a0issue.\"The attacker was reportedly working as a security guard at the time of the shooting and did not have a serious criminal record.

Next thing you know, we hear gunshots... all you hear is like 50, 60 gunshots,\" she said.\"We kept our calm as best that we could, tried to keep our customers calm... we shut the door, everything is closed. Nobody can buy anything. We're all hiding in the back.Another witness, Elaine Penicaro, said she was finishing her shopping trip when she heard \"all this popping\".\"So we kind of just all just stopped. But then a second later, like pop, pop, pop, pop, pop. And we saw sparks flying like it was right in front of us,\" she said. \"So we just ran into the Converse store. They locked the door. We all hunkered down in the back - and that's where we stayed.\"Speaking to CBS, Steven Spainhouer described how he rushed to the scene after getting a call from his son who reported shooting. He spoke of \"unfathomable carnage\".He said at least three victims could not be saved even after he applied CPR. \"The first girl I walked up to was crouched down covering her head in the bushes,\" he recalled. \"So I felt for a pulse, pulled her head to the side, and she had no face.\"He helped a boy who was under his mother's dead body.\"When I rolled the mother over, he came out. I asked him if he was OK and he said, 'My mom is hurt, my mom is hurt'. So, rather than traumatise him any more, I pulled him around the corner and sat him down.\"The boy was \"covered from head to toe\" in blood, Mr Spainhouer said.Allen is a racially diverse suburb north of Dallas and has an infamous connection with another recent mass shooting.A man who lived there in 2019 went on a gun rampage at a Walmart in El Paso, killing 23 people, after posting a racist manifesto online.

        "text": "This video can not be playedWATCH: Fire engulfs Odesa warehouseAir raid sirens have sounded across Ukraine after Russia launched a fresh wave of drone and missile strikes.Explosions were heard overnight in the capital, Kyiv, where the mayor said five people had been injured in the \"biggest\" kamikaze drone attack so far.One person was killed in the attack on the southern Odesa region. Ukraine's Red Cross says its warehouse was hit.It marks the fourth attack in eight days on Kyiv and comes just 24 hours before Russia celebrates Victory Day.The annual holiday commemorates the Soviet Union's victory over Nazi Germany during World War Two, a conflict the Kremlin has baselessly tried to draw parallels with since launching its invasion of Ukraine last year.After a lull in Russian attacks on civilian targets in recent months, which saw Kyiv go days without an attack, Moscow has intensified its air raids over the past week ahead of a widely expected Ukrainian counter-offensive.The Ukrainian military said the latest Russian raids - which lasted for more than four hours and were launched shortly after midnight - saw Iranian-made Shahed kamikaze drones swarm across the country.Kyiv's Mayor Vitaliy Klitschko said nearly 60 drones had been launched by Russia, describing it as the \"biggest\" such attack so far.He added that all 36 drones had been destroyed over Kyiv, but five people had been injured by falling debris from downed drones.The BBC has not been able to verify these numbers.Emergency services responded after drone wreckage fell on a runway at Zhuliany international airport - one of the city's two commercial airports - Kyiv's military administration said.And civilians were injured after drone debris hit a residential building in the central Shevchenkivskyi district, the administration added.Elsewhere, in the Black Sea port city of Odesa, a warehouse was set ablaze after eight missiles were fired at targets by Russian bombers, Ukrainian officials said.In a statement, Ukraine's Red Cross said its warehouse with humanitarian aid was destroyed and all aid deliveries had to be suspended.Natalia Humeniuk, a spokesperson for Ukraine's Southern Command, later said a body of a man - a security guard - was pulled from the wreckage.In a daily update, the Ukrainian military's command said there had also been a wave of missile strikes on the Kherson, Kharkiv and Mykolaiv regions.At least eight people - including a child - were injured in two villages in the southern Kherson region, local officials said.In Zaporizhzhia, the head of the Russian installed administration, Vladimir Rogov, said Russian forces hit a warehouse and a Ukrainian troop position in the small city of Orikhiv.On the eastern front, the Ukrainian commander of forces in the besieged eastern city of Bakhmut said Russian troops had stepped up shelling, in a bid to take the city by Tuesday's celebrations.Russian troops and fighters from the Wagner Group, a private military company, have been trying to capture Bakhmut for months - despite its questionable strategic value.Over the weekend, Wagner's founder Yevgeny Prigozhinfrom the city after he was promised fresh ammunition supplies by the defence ministry in Moscow.Meanwhile, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky announced that 9 May would from now be celebrated as Europe Day, in line with the European Union. The move - which needs parliamentary approval - is seen as a pointed rebuke to Russia.Mr Zelensky said he had signed a decree that the day would commemorate European unity and the defeat of \"Ruscism\" - a term that is shorthand for \"Russian fascism\".He also said that 8 May would now officially be a Day of Remembrance and Victory, as marked in many countries around the world.Russia accused of dropping phosphorus bombsWagner 'promised ammunition' after retreat threatWhat it's like inside Russia 14 months after invasion"

        "text": "Written byTikTok users of a certain age are getting a heavy dose of nostalgia with a new trending filter that purports to wind back time to your teenage self.Teenage Look, which mostly works by smoothing out wrinkles, has quickly racked up 3.4 million views to date, often paired with the melody from The Verve Pipe's 1996 alt heartbreak song \"The Freshmen.\" But while baby face and aging filters have previously made the rounds on social media platforms for the simple novelty of seeing yourself time travel instantaneously, many of the top-liked posts teenage-filter posts are somber in tone, as users say they are getting a flashback to some of their most formative years.Madonna hits back at ageist criticism after Grammy Awards appearance\"If you're young and you're wondering why us old people are freaking out about this filter, it's because 20, 30 years from now in your head you're still gonna think you look like this,\" says TikTok usermandertokin one video, with the filter on so that he appears younger. \"And then there will be some sort of filter that makes you realize you look like this now,\" he continues, showing the split screen with his real, visibly older self.While some TikTokers are keeping it light, showing real pictures of their teenage selves (hello, former scene kids with bad hair) others are using the filter to talk about the lack of self-confidence they had in high school or the difficult experiences they faced, using split screens of the before and after to impart life advice to their \"younger\" selves.Though many of the posts featuring tears and shocked faces can feel performative for virality's sake (it is TikTok, after all), there is something jarring about being able to see a face that hasn't looked back at you in the mirror for some time. Some users have discussed how the filter has kicked up old emotions related to trauma they experienced during those years, while others said it's given trans and non-binary individuals the opportunity to see a younger self that matches with their gender identity.Look of the Week: With these big red boots, fashion is entering its silly era\"Okay y'all, if you're somebody who has changed the way they present themselves as an adult or have transitioned in some way and you wanna have a moment, say hi to the 12-year-old you that probably didn't get to exist,\" the userworriersmusicsaid in one video.However, filters have regularly been criticized broadly for worsening self-esteem issues, and an anti-aging filter in an anti-aging society, particularly for women, seems primed to perpetuate this problem. One small study from 2019linkedsocial media filter use with higher acceptance of cosmetic surgery, while researchers from Harvard Business Reviewfoundin 2021 that people with high confidence in their looks can actually be rattled more by seeing \"improvements\" to their face versus those who already had insecurities. And while the \"Teenage Look\" filter may not always be accurate at showing an earlier you, as many users have noted, it is more natural-looking than many of the uncanny valley or soft-focus beauty filters in circulation.Upon applying the filter, some users have also commented that the signs of age appear more pronounced in the unfiltered image.\"Seriously, they are making the 'now' look worse to make it more dramatic, right? Right?!\" mandertok half-jokingly wrote in the video's caption."

        "text": "Written byKeeping you in the know,Culture Queueis an ongoing series of recommendations for timely books to read, films to watch and podcasts and music to listen to.In the introduction to her book\"Butts: A Backstory,\"journalist Heather Radke recalls a moment when, at 10 years old, she and a friend were cat-called by two teenage boys while out riding their bikes.\"'Nice butts!' we heard them say,\" Radke writes. \"The fact that they said something unprompted about our butts felt uncomfortable and bizarre... I was aware that there were body parts that were considered beautiful and sexy and were coveted by others, but it had not occurred to me that the butt was one of them.\"That episode was just one a series that led Radke to realize how big of a role backsides play not just inour relationships with our bodies, but in the cultural, social and gender-specific experiences that define womanhood.\"Butts, silly as they may often seem, are tremendously complex symbols, fraught with significance and nuance, laden with humor and sex, shame and history,\" she writes. \"The shape andsize of a woman's butthas long been a perceived indicator of her very nature \u2014 her morality, her femininity and even her humanity.\"It's from these observations that \"Butts\" \u2014 a thoroughly researched cultural history of the female butt \u2014 stems.From supersized to a more natural look: The evolution of breast implantsWeaving together memoir, science, history and cultural criticism, the book addresses the physiological origins of our behinds and takes readers from the cinched waists of the Victorian era all the way toKim Kardashian's Internet-breaking backsideand the popularization of the Brazilian butt lift. In between, Radke examines the role of eugenics, fashion, fitness fads and pop culture in defining the racial and misogynistic standards surrounding the butt.\"I only know what it's like to be a White woman with a big butt, which obviously has its limitations,\" Radke said in a phone interview. \"It was important to me to challenge our ideas about where bodies come from by listening to different voices.\"\"Since the rise ofthe transatlantic slave trade, there's always been a kind of racial undermeaning in any conversation around the butt, as well as gendered approaches to questions like 'What is a feminine body? What is a beautiful body? And how feminine can a beautiful body be?'\" she continued. \"The answers to those questions have oscillated through time, but our deep preoccupation with this specific body part reveals how the butt has long been used as a means to impart control, prescribe desire, and install racial hierarchies.\"A recurring figure in \"Butts\" is Saartjie \"Sarah\" Baartman \u2014 the so-called Hottentot Venus (the term Hottentot, now widely regarded as offensive, was historically used to refer to the Khoekhoe, an indigenous tribe of South Africa). Baartman was an Indigenous Khoe woman forced to exhibit her \"large butt\" for White audiences in Cape Town, London and Paris in the 19th century.Radke's account of Baartman's life, and of how her body became \"a fantasy of African hypersexuality,\" underlies much of the book's narrative, as she traces the stereotypes created by European\"racial scientists\"of that era and, later, the skewed and prejudiced legacy of big-butted women as more highly sexual -- especially Black women -- directly back to the exploited Baartman.Radke highlights the bustle  garment popular in the 19th century.Radke spoke with Janell Hobson, a professor of women's, gender, and sexuality studies at the State University of New York at Albany who has written extensively on Baartman. Hobson links the fetishization of Baartman's figure to the seeding of colonialism and the continuation of slavery into White society.'Calendar Girls' shows senior women like you've never seen them (but probably should)\"(Baartman's) show perpetuated ideas around African savagery and primitive Black womanhood, \" Hobson explains in in the book. \"So when white people were looking at Sarah Baartman, they were projecting all of this stuff they'd already inculcated in the culture.\"\"Baartman's story is still with us in a lot of ways,\" Radke said. Although she died in 1815, \"her body was on display in Paris up until the 1980s, then again in the '90s. That really isn't that long ago, and tells you just how much we've turned her into something grotesque to gawk at \u2014 a stereotype and symbol of exploitation.\"Radke later points to the bustle \u2014 an undergarment  popularized in the late 19th century designed to make a woman's backside look enormous \u2014 as a glaring example of White appropriation of Baartman's figure. \"It was a way for Victorian women to look like Sarah Baartman, while at the same time asserting their own whiteness and privilege, as it could simply be taken off,\" Radke said. \"That behavior would be repeated again and again through history.\"Miley Cyrus performs during her Bangerz tour at the MGM Grand Garden Arena on March 1, 2014 in Las Vegas, Nevada.Shee explores that same butt-based cultural appropriation \u2014 and monetization \u2014 as exercised by celebrities like Kim Kardashian and Miley Cyrus, whose famous twerking routine at the 2013 MTV Video Music Awards and during concerts on her \"Bangerz Tour\" that same year (where she used a large prosthetic butt as part of her choreography) was, Radke writes, a prop to \"'play' in Blackness.\"The 'fox eye' beauty trend continues to spread online. But critics insist it's racistAlongside addressing the visual culture of Black music videos, plastic surgery and the recent belfie (a portmanteau of butt and selfie) craze in the same vein, Radke also highlights periods in contemporary history where trends skewed in different, oppositional directions. She highlights the rise of \"buttless women\" in the 1910s \u2014 a look best represented by the sleek look of the flapper \u2014 through the invention of sizing and the 90s brand of \"heroin chic\" captured by the supermodelKate Moss. Such an aesthetic is \"something that's never really gone away,\" Radke noted.\"I didn't aspire to write an encyclopedia of the butt, but rather give a historical context to the way it has been perceived and portrayed, and how women's feelings around it have shifted alongside it,\" Radke explained. \"Whether consciously or not, we, and society at large, have always been paying attention to our butts \u2014 hiding them, accentuating them, fetishizing them. Which is kind of funny, when you think it's actually a body part we cannot see ourselves unless we're in front of a mirror.\" As she writes in her book, \"the butt belongs to the viewer more than the viewed.\"While many of the stories exposed in \"Butts\" are steeped in physical suffering \u2014 diets, restricting shapewear, surgical scalpels \u2014 there's also joy to be found.To counter the extreme workout regimes of the 80s, like the\"Buns of Steel\"fitness craze that equated a sculpted butt to self-control and self-respect, Radke profiled the fat fitness movement that emerged during the same decade, which reimagined \"what was possible for people who often felt excluded from mainstream fitness culture\" to offer a form of resistance.Drag queens dress using padding and stockings  prior to the NEPA PrideFest Royale drag pageant at the Hilton Conference Center in Scranton, Pennsylvania on June 25, 2022.In Astoria, Queens, she spent time with a group of drag queens who sculpt foam butt pads to embellish their backsides, turning the butt into something joyous and judgment-free.\"A history of bodies \u2014 especially female bodies \u2014 is always going to be a history of control and oppression, but I felt it was important to also show the other possibility: liberation,\" Radke said. \"Those stories were some of the most fun research I did, and some of the most surprising, too, as they allowed me to meet people who have overcome societal prescriptions, and embraced a different way to think about bigness, which helped me reframe it, too.\"Ultimately, Radke said, what's perhaps most compelling about the butt is that it doesn't have to mean anything.\"Butts have the power to make us feel so miserable or angry, especially when we're in a dressing room trying on a pair of jeans that just won't fit,\" she noted. \"But that angst is the result of centuries of history, culture and politics. It doesn't come from our bodies, it has been placed on them. If we take a step back, we'll see that butts are just a body part. They could mean nothing at all.\"\"Butts: A Backstory.\"\"Ugliness, A Cultural History\" (2015)Author and academic Gretchen E. Henderson delves into the meaning of ugliness, tracing its hold on our cultural imagination and examining how we've always been attracted to it. With analysis stretching from from ancient Roman feasts to Mary Shelley's Frankenstein and acrossart, music and Uglydolls, the book casts an unflinching gaze at the ways ugliness has shaped and challenged aesthetics and taste.\"Braided: An American Hair Story\" (2019)Charting the history of braids in the United States through slavery, Black entrepreneurship and, ultimately, its cultural appropriation by the mainstream, this Elle magazine-produced documentary looks at the influence and legacy of the hair styles in American culture.\"The Power of Style: How Fashion and Beauty Are Being Used to Reclaim Cultures\" (2021)As an Indigenous (Ojibwe) member of the Nipissing First Nation reservation in northern Ontario, Christian Allaire didn't see his culture reflected in any media or pop culture growing up.

Originally a treatment for strabismus, or crossed eyes, in the late 1960s and 1970s, the injections were later harnessed by the cosmetics industry for their skin-smoothing properties and were approved by the US Food and Drug Administration to treat frown lines in 2002.Under the ASA's guidelines, prescription-only medical treatments -- including Botox -- must not be advertised to the public. Glowday was found to be in breach of this.The ASA said: \"We considered the ad exploited women's insecurities around aging, and perpetuated the harmful gender stereotype that women should look a certain way. We concluded it was irresponsible and breached the (UK Advertising) Code.\"The regulator added that the website \"went beyond the provision of factual information and instead promoted Botox to the general public.\"Responding to the ban, Glowday told the ASA that the article was originally published in September 2021 and had since been removed.Teens are worried about wrinkles. Here's how Gen Z is helping to fuel a beauty boomIt argued that the article was based on research data which surveyed more than 1,000 women aged 26 to 55, many of whom had been involved in childcare and home schooling during the pandemic and school holidays.Glowday said it reported a rise in treatment following the pandemic and school holidays \"because caregivers finally had the opportunity to care for themselves.\"In a statement to CNN, Hannah Russell, founder and CEO of Glowday, insisted it was not advertising Botox because users cannot purchase or book treatments directly on the site.Instead, Russell said the company aimed to \"provide consumers with unbiased information about a whole range of aesthetic and skin treatments.\"Russell said: \"The irony of the ASA ruling is that whilst thousands of unregulated, unaccountable non-medic injectors continue to dangerously administer fillers and toxin and promote their services across social media and the internet, without recourse, responsible companies like Glowday and its accountable practitioners that are challenged.\"A spokeswoman for Glowday added that the content aimed at mothers \"wasn't an advert or a promotion\" but a \"written article from our editor about a trend.\"Holli Rubin, a psychotherapist, body image specialist and mental health practitioner based in London, told CNN: \"Women, especially mothers, do not need any additional pressure placed on them -- they feel it from all sides -- social, emotional, financial, and aesthetic.\"Women fail to put their needs above those they work with and take care of and this advertisement just reinforces that in order to value themselves they must partake in these procedures. It is a shame that this messaging continues to be so pervasive today.\""

        "name": "The art of growing bald gracefully",
        "link": "https://edition.cnn.com/style/article/male-pattern-baldness-experience-acceptance/index.html",
        "text": "Written byThere are three important days in every bald(ing) man's life: The day you realize you're losing your hair, the day you realize you should shave off what remains, and the day you finally do. Growing bald gracefully is about reducing the gap between these milestones as far as possible. I learned this the hard way.Before recounting my decade of denial and deceit, here are the bare-headed facts: I suffer from a type of baldness I call \"the Prince William.\" It combines an expanding circular patch on top (\"the Friar Tuck\") and receding corners (\"the Jude Law\"). The two must eventually meet. Or, to put it another way: The bridge between my last strongholds of follicle activity has grown ever thinner, my hairline drifting apart like two continental landmasses. What once resembled Pangaea is now little more than a footbridge over the Bering Strait.My mother was the first to notice this tectonic shift. \"You're thinning,\" she observed, hovering over my then-25-year-old self at the family table. It seemed fitting that the woman who delivered me into this world should also discover my first sign of aging. After all, losing your hair is coming to terms with the possibility of looking like a big baby again. (Although my mom recently confirmed via WhatsApp that I had a full head of hair at birth. \"I don't do bald babies,\" she added, unhelpfully.)What followed will be familiar to men around the world. Realization is a creeping process of denial eroded by moments of shock and, later, resignation. Denial was believing that what wasn't in the mirror (namely a birds-eye view of my head) didn't exist. Shock was encountering a photo of myself, taken from above, and wondering, 'Who's that balding guy standing exactly where I was?' Resignation was seeing an acquaintance across a bar, his greasy comb-over fooling only himself, and muttering to my wife: \"Just don't let me get like him.\"I almost did. Another five years would pass until I conceded defeat. I moved to Hong Kong and found amiracle barberwho proved that coolness isn't a hairstyle alone. A budding breakdancer (and bald by choice: hair is something of an impediment to head-spinning), he was adept at arranging my remaining locks in a way that maintained the illusion.We had an unspoken understanding. But when I moved again last year, my attempts to explain his magic to new hair stylists became increasingly embarrassing. It felt like I was making them accomplices in my deception. \"Just make it look... better?\" I'd say, before removing my glasses and hoping what emerged would sustain me for another month or three. Successive barbers played along. But I, too, was fooling only myself.Instagram's algorithms discovered my situation and began populating my feed with clips of extreme toup\u00e9e makeovers. Hints from loved ones were even less subtle \u2014 like when my wife returned from a work trip brandishing a gift, only to reveal a bottle of UV-protective scalp spray. Who said romance is dead?How 'Queer Eye' star Karamo Brown battled through insecurities over hair lossIn the meantime, I began making self-deprecating jokes and became more comfortable discussing my fate. Invariably, friends offered the same three condolences in reply: 1) That \"at least\" I can grow a beard, 2) that I have a \"good-shaped head,\" whatever that means, and 3) that, if I'm lucky, I might end up resembling the universal gold standard of attractive bald White dudes: Bruce Willis.If you find yourself reassuring a balding man that he looks like Bruce Willis, I promise you he's heard it many times before. It is reassuring, nonetheless.As your hair thins, small clumps start sticking out in new and unexpected directions. Human hairs crave company \u2014 and when their neighbors depart, they don't know where to go.I'd spend cumulative hours trying to convince individual strands to stick back down. Then one winter morning, as I fussed over a group of errant strays, a moment of clarity: I had grown more insecure about my hair than what lurked beneath.That evening I purchased clippers, took them to the bathroom and unceremoniously gave myself the only hairstyle I'll have for the rest of my life. A full 10 years after diagnosis, male pattern baldness had secured its final victory. A chapter of my youth ended in a pile of limp offcuts on the shower floor.With hair loss on the rise, Asia's men grapple with what it means to be baldMy wife told me I look much better than before. But she has to say that. My editor meanwhile assured me that I look more \"athletic,\" (indeed, my streamlined form may have knocked a few seconds off my swim time). Other benefits, I told myself, include quicker post-shower drying, no money spent on haircuts and time saved getting ready each morning.Soon after completing the deed, I sent a selfie to my friend Anton. \"Welcome to the sexy zone, comrade,\" he wrote back.Anton was the first among my friends to go bald. While I had the luxury of holding out until aged 35, he was an angst-prone 18 when he first found clumps of hair on the pillow. The denial phase lasted only until his early 20s, when it was shattered at a theater workshop by a teacher who instructed the class to \"tilt over until you can see Anton's bald spot.\" He then performed what Anton described as a \"little tap on the top of my head.\"\"I was like, 'What the f**k?'\" he recalled over Zoom. \"I didn't say it, but I felt assaulted. Not only because he tapped me on the head, but because I didn't even know I was bald! That was the first I'd heard about it.\"He soon found looking at photos of himself depressing. He too was assured that \"at least\" he had a beard and a \"good-shaped head\" \u2014 again, whatever that means. Someone told him he looked like Jason Statham, who is just the British equivalent to Willis. For Anton, going bald was \"a very lonely\" experience, especially at such a young age.\"There is something especially isolating about something happening to you that is socially acceptable to laugh at,\" he said. \"There wasn't a sense of anyone feeling anything other than, 'Sucks to be you.'\"For the record, Anton looks great bald \u2014 and I'm not just returning his compliment. Unlike me, he's got some muscle on him. As a boxing instructor, he suits the skinhead look. In a2012 study, which I cite simply because I approve of the results, University of Pennsylvania researchers found that images of men with their hair digitally removed were perceived to be \"more dominant, taller and stronger\" when compared to the original photographs.\"Holding on to your hair is a lot less attractive than just getting rid of it,\" Anton said. \"You can look sharper. You just change the image of yourself in your mind's eye, then you suddenly appreciate it for a different aesthetic value.\"It's taken me 35 years, but now I'm very fond of how I look,\" he added. \"I got to a point where I realized any criticism of my appearance isn't based on anything other than an impression of what other people might think.\"I am not massively worried about being considered less attractive. Nor am I concerned about looking older or being called a \"slaphead,\" as we're disparagingly known in Britain. It's the loss of identity I struggle with.My hairless head will, forever more, be my distinguishing physical attribute. To strangers I am now, officially, \"that bald guy.\"That bald guy at table seven.On the left, just past that bald guy.No, it goes back to that bald guy.Why you should reinstate the classic alarm clockMy fear that all hairless men look the same is reinforced by the fact that people keep saying I look like my dad. No one hadnoted this resemblance before. Now, suddenly, we're like two shiny-headed, bearded peas in a pod. There is a certain poetic justice here, and I suffer regular flashbacks to the bald jokes I'd tell at my dad's expense. He assures me he didn't take them personally.My dad started balding at 16. By the time he was my age, his naked head was competing with the mullets and perms of the 1980s. But he appears genuinely impervious to his baldness. \"I can't remember ever being sensitive about it my whole life,\" he told me over Zoom. Maybe boomers just don't like talking about their feelings, but I believe him.\"I wasn't a cool or attractive teenager in the slightest,\" he recalled. \"But I managed to build up a good social life because I could make people laugh. I took a decision, fairly early on in life, that I'd only get anywhere if I relied on my wit, charm and personality. Baldness was pretty low down on my list of priorities.\"Whether he's to blame for my hairline is matter of debate.Studiesof identical twins have found that heredity factors account for around 80% of men's predisposition to baldness, though the genetics are poorly understood. An old wives' tale dictates that hair loss is passed down via the mother, and thus your maternal grandfather's hairline is the best predictor of your own. There is no conclusive evidence for this, however, and my dad sees \"no observable pattern\" in our family (his generation included one Friar Tuck, one Jude Law and one full head of hair).Lifestyle factors can play a part, and I often wonder whether my fate was hastened by eating trans fats and not sleeping enough, or by living in Beijing during some of its most grimly polluted years. But my hairline's retreat was likely predestined. As such, I am at peace with it. Although I didn't grow bald gracefully, I can still aspire tobald with grace.Anton's advice for me and fellow newcomers to his \"sexy zone\" is as follows: Moisturize your head daily, shave it every few days and wear hats to protect against the sun and heat loss alike. If you have a beard, keep it groomed; if you're muscly, be aware of intimidating people and disarm them with a smile. And remember, he concluded, the way you carry yourself matters more than what is \u2014 or isn't \u2014 sprouting from the top of your head.My dad's advice is a little blunter: \"If I were you, I would concentrate on developing your wit, charm and personality.\""

        "text": "Written byWhen celebrated photographer Greg Girard landed inTokyoin April 1976, he expected to spend only a few days in the Japanese capital. At that time a \"broke traveler\" in his early 20s, he was headed to more affordable destinations in southeast Asia.He left his luggage at Haneda Airport and, with nowhere to sleep, spent his first night in Tokyo roaming the streets of the city's lively Shinjuku district, camera in hand.\"I was just floored by the way everything looked, because it was never presented in the West, this modern city,\" Girard recalled in a video interview, noting that his arrival was long before movies like \"Blade Runner\" and '90s pop culture exposed mainstream Western audiences to Asian metropolises.\"I ended up deciding, pretty much on that first night, that I was going to stay,\" he said.A 1979 image shows a crosswalk in Tokyo's Shinjuku district.What began as a whim became a four-year stint, which saw Girard teaching English by day and photographing Tokyo by night. He rented an apartment and, nearby, a small darkroom where he would develop his pictures.He didn't know it then, but these images captured the boom years before Japan's infamous economic bubble burst in the 1990s. With the yen soaring, a sharp increase in market speculation would eventually lead to financial crisis. But before then, Girard said, there was a palpable sense of emerging affluence \u2014 one woven through his images of consumer electronics, office towers and bustling intersections.\"This was the time of Japan's rise, before the rest of the world was really aware of what was happening,\" said the Canadian photographer, who published a selection of his vintage photos in the new book \"JAL 76 88,\" adding: \"It was a period of real optimism and a dynamic kind of growth of Japan as a place that was starting to become treated as an equal (to the West).\"During his nocturnal wanderings, Girard became fascinated not only by the Japan's rapidly ascendent economy but by what unfolded there after hours. Many of the book's images hint at the country's darker underbelly: Posters of nude women, entrances to seedy nightclubs and empty hotel rooms that leave viewers wondering what might have unfolded in them.The photographer who captured Hong Kong's disappearing past\"There was this division between the practicality of running 'Japan Inc' \u2014 making sure people get to bed early \u2014 and the release mechanism of staying out all night if you wanted to,\" the photographer said. \"Both of those things were going on at the same time.\"The trains would stop at midnight, so there was a whole subculture around what to do between the last train stopping and the first one beginning (the next morning),\" he continued. \"There were game arcades and all-night coffee shops where people parked themselves in front of an expensive coffee and no one bothered you for sleeping in a booth all night \u2014 that's kind of what they were there for.\"The inside of a hotel room in Nara, Japan.Girard's once-futuristic images ooze vibrant greens, pinks and blues, colors saturated by his use of long exposure settings. The photographer allowed light to flood into his lens and illuminate what lay in the shadows. Often using a tripod to steady his shots, he focused on where the light fell, not where it originated from, painting Japan's cities basking in a neon glow rather than emitting one.\"It felt right to move away from the cliche of neon signs,\" he said, \"and to see where the light was landing, whether it was on people, buildings, cars, puddles or whatever it might be.\"The title of Girard's new book, \"JAL 76 88,\" combines Japan Airlines' callsign with the years between which the photos were taken (he also included images from assignments that took him to Japan in the late 1980s, after he had relocated to Hong Kong). Dozens of daytime pictures also feature, as does a selection of black and white photos. Girard would often carry two cameras -- one with monochrome film and the other color -- at the same time.The Japanese photographer who shrink-wraps entire families -- and their homesBut for all the vibrancy captured in the photos, some of his most compelling images are void of human activity, whether deserted construction sites or empty passageways floodlit by streetlamps. As he familiarized himself with Tokyo, Girard used photography as an excuse to explore quieter areas he might not otherwise have visited.\"The alleys and streets just off the entertainment districts, or the ordinary neighborhoods -- they had a life of their own, too,\" he said. \"I went wandering, just looking down alleys around the waterfront, before it became a popular part of the city. Whatever place you live in, making pictures is a way to make it your own.\"Nightlife in Yokosuka, a city in Japan's Kanagawa prefecture.Girard's experiences also helped honed his camera skills, laying the groundwork for a successful photography career. Experimenting with long exposures and different types of film was something he \"consciously started to explore and get good at technically\" in those years, he said, adding: \"So it was that learning process as well.\"In the decades since leaving Japan, he has shot for magazines including National Geographic and TIME while publishing books on a number of Asian cities, including Hanoi, Okinawa and Shanghai. He is perhaps best-known for hisimagesof the now-demolished Kowloon Walled City, an almost entirely lawless, mob-controlled enclave in Hong Kong that once housed some 50,000 residents in just 6.4 acres.Capturing neon-lit Tokyo through a game designer's eyesLooking back, Girard says his photos of Japan serve as a kind of diary of his youth. But despite spending his nights on the town, he always maintained a certain distance from the nightlife he documented. His focus was always on photography itself.\"I didn't go to bars to drink or to party \u2014 in those days, anyway,\" he said. \"I was doing almost anything and everything just to make pictures.\""

The miniskirt, named after the Mini Cooper, became a defining staple of the Swinging Sixties.New documentary explores a '60s icon -- and tiny garment -- that shaped a new era in fashionFor women who came of age wearing them, Quant's designs represented freedom, empowerment, and the rejection of their parents' aesthetic standards.Her clothes, as she made clear in Sadie Frost's 2021 documentary \"Quant\" about her life, were not meant for an elite of \"stately ladies,\" but offered a colorful break from the stiff sartorial codes of the previous decade, including the polished style of Christian Dior's first collection, \"the New Look.\"Whether Quant did in fact invent the miniskirt is a hotly debated topic -- the documentary also mentions French designer Andr\u00e9 Courr\u00e8ges as the possible creator of the garment. But she was responsible for turning the increasingly shorter skirt into the era-defining garment of the 1960s, breaking down social codes in the process.And Quant's fashion empire stretched beyond the miniskirt, as she helped popularize other groundbreaking trends such as her very own Vidal Sassoon bob; the \"Chelsea girl\" coquettish aesthetic; Peter Pan collars; colorful tights, created to complement her bold and bright collections; her use of PVC for outerwear (something that previously had only been worn by fishermen); male knits repurposed as womens' sweater dresses; and dress pockets.A gallery display of the Victoria & Albert Museum's exhibition showing pieces by Mary Quant.Alexandra Shulman, former editor-in-chief of British Vogue, paid tribute to Quant Thursday, posting onTwitter: \"RIP Dame Mary Quant.

        "link": "https://edition.cnn.com/style/article/harold-edgerton-bullet-apple-snap/index.html",
        "text": "Written byInSnap, we look at the power of a single photograph, chronicling stories about how both modern and historical images have been made.Exploding with energy but perfectly still, Harold \"Doc\" Edgerton's 1964 image of a .30-caliber bullet ripping through an apple showed an otherwise unseeable moment in captivating detail. The scene took on a serene, sculptural beauty as the disintegrating apple's skin burst open against a deep blue backdrop.The picture is widely viewed as a work ofart. More importantly to its creator, however, it was also a feat of electrical engineering. The longtime Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) professor used it to illustrate a lecture, famously titled \"How to make applesauce,\" in which he explained the pioneering flash technology that helped him take the shot.Edgerton, who died in 1990 aged 86, is considered the father of high-speed photography. Camera shutter speeds were too slow to capture a bullet flying at 2,800 feet per second, but his stroboscopic flashes \u2014 a precursor to modern-day strobe lights \u2014 created bursts of light so short that a well-timed photograph, taken in an otherwise dark room, made it appear as if time had stood still. The results were mesmerizing and, often, messy.\"We used to joke that that it took a third of a microsecond (one-millionth of a second) to take the picture \u2014 and all morning to clean up,\" recalled his former student and teaching assistant, J. Kim Vandiver, on a video call from Massachusetts.The 1964 image has become one of the 20th century's best-known photographs.While early camera operators had experimented with pyrotechnic \"flash powders\" that combined metallic fuels and oxidizing agents to produce a short, bright chemical reaction, Nebraska-born Edgerton created a flash that was far shorter and easier to control. His breakthrough was more a matter of physics than chemistry: After he arrived at MIT in the 1920s, he developed a flashtube filled with xenon gas that, when subjected to high voltage, would cause electricity to jump between two electrodes for a fraction of a second.By the time he fired the shutter for his now-famous apple photo, Edgerton had developed a microflash thatused plain airrather than xenon. He had also produced decades' worth ofwell-known images: hummingbirds in mid-flight, golf clubs hitting balls and even nuclear bomb blasts. (During World War II, Edgerton developed a special \"rapatronic\" \u2014 or rapid electronic \u2014 camera for the Atomic Energy Commission that could control the amount of light entering the camera during the explosions.)'Napalm Girl' at 50: The story of the Vietnam War's defining photoYet, it was his 1960s bullet photos that proved some of this most memorable. According to Vandiver, who still works at MIT as a mechanical engineering professor, the challenge wasn't producing a flash but setting the camera off at just the right time. Human reactions were too slow to take the photo manually, so Edgerton used the sound of the bullet itself as a trigger.\"There would be a microphone out of the picture, just down below,\" Vandiver said. \"So, when the shock wave from the bullet hit the microphone, the microphone tripped the flash and then you'd close the (shutter afterwards).\"Over the years, Edgerton and his students took a rifle to objects including bananas, balloons and playing cards. For Vandiver, the reason why the apple \u2014 along with a1957 imageof a splashing milk droplet \u2014 became one of Edgerton's defining photographs is, in part, its simplicity. \"It catches your imagination... and you immediately understand what it is,\" he said.Another of Edgerton's famous photos, taken in 1957, shows the crown-like splash produced by milk droplets.There was another factor at play: Edgerton's artistic eye. The compositional beauty of his images saw them republished in newspapers and magazines around the world, and over 100 of his photos are held by the Smithsonian American Art Museum today. Yet Edgerton rejected the additional title.\"Don't make me out to be an artist,\" he has been quoted as saying. \"I am an engineer. I am after the facts, only the facts.\"How artist Amy Sherald reimagined history's most famous kissWhile Vandiver said \"there's definitely an artistic legacy\" to Edgerton's visual experiments, which advanced the field of photography, his research has greatly impacted science and industry, too. His hands-on approach lives on at MIT'sEdgerton Center, which was established in his honor in 1992. Vandiver, who serves as the center's director, said every student is encouraged to take a bullet photograph of their own.\"We still teach the course, and students still think of weird things to take pictures of,\" he said, recalling recent images of colored chalk and lipstick torn apart by bullets. \"Apples are boring now.\""

        "text": "Written byInSnap, we look at the power of a single photograph, chronicling stories about how both modern and historical images have been made.To passersby, the sight of two men embracing besidesNew Delhi'sIndia Gate in 1986 might have seemed unremarkable. In a city where public displays of platonic male affection are relatively commonplace, it was photographer Sunil Gupta who attracted more attention at the time.\"Men holding hands or lying in each other's laps is not an issue \u2014 it looks very romantic from (the outside), but they're usually just hanging out,\" he said in a video interview from the UK, before recalling: \"I was creating more interest than them, because I was standing there with a tripod and a camera, so everybody was focused on me.\"Onlookers may not have realized, but Gupta was creating a subtly subversive image in what he hasdescribedas the \"repressive atmosphere\" of 1980sIndia. At a time when homosexuality was more taboo in the country than it is today \u2014 and with consensual gay sex then criminalized as an \"unnatural offense\" \u2014 the photographer had found his subjects via the informal networks constituting Delhi's gay scene. The pair in question had chosen the war monument's gardens for their photo shoot due to its reputation as a cruising spot.Photo of a man posing with a Coca-Cola bottle in 1981 symbolized a cultural shift in ChinaHaving lived in New Delhi until his mid-teens, London-based Gupta knew this from personal experience. \"I passed that place on my way to school every day for 11 years,\" he said. \"You just had to hop off the bus and get laid on your way home. It was very easy.\"The image forms part of the photographer's series \"Exiles,\" which was first exhibited in the UK in 1987 but is this week showing at theIndia Art Fairin New Delhi. Primarily shot outdoors around India's capital, it captures gay men sat on benches or in public places popular among those looking for casual sexual partners, their faces often out of shot or turned away from the camera.Concerned about \"outing\" his subjects, Gupta treated them as collaborators in what he called a \"constructed documentary\" approach. After shooting his images and developing the film in London, he returned to Delhi with printed contact sheets to ensure the men were comfortable with the pictures he selected for his show.\"There was quite a bit of horsing around in the pictures,\" he said of the India Gate shoot. \"And there were other photos that were (more suggestive)... So I picked a somewhat tamer one to put in the series.\"The other ethical challenge, he recalled, was communicating to the duo how the images would be used \u2014 and the art of photography itself.\"It wasn't for publication, and the only way they saw pictures was in a magazine, so it took some explaining,\" he said, adding: \"Then I tried to explain the process.\"Photography for many at the time, Gupta observed, was still \"a very mysterious thing that only a few people did in a darkroom.\"A portrait of one of the few young, female truckers in FranceNow among India's most celebrated photographic artists, Gupta often addressed LGBTQ experiences in his explorations of race, immigration and identity. While studying in the US in the mid-1970s he produced a now-celebrated series of photos from New York's Christopher Street that captured the city's gay scene in the years between the Stonewall Riots and onset of the AIDS epidemic.Although \"Exiles\" presented a rare portrait of gay life outside the West, Gupta's intended audience was always back in London. Homophobia was rife in 1980s Britain, and the photographer said he faced \"a lot of hostility\" at art school for making work relating to his sexuality.\"I couldn't make gay work, and I couldn't make gay work about India, especially,\" he said. \"There was none in the library for reference. So, I thought, 'I'm making it my mission to make some. Not for India, but for this canon \u2014 we need to have gay Indian guys in our library, in our art schools, over here.'\"New York's Museum of Modern Art has sinceacquiredseveral of the pictures for its permanent collection, signifying the series' place in contemporary photography. But it was not an instant success.\"It didn't have any impact when it was first shown,\" Gupta said of its debut.  \"I think it was too early.\"By the 1990s, however, interest in Gupta's work was growing, as art made by, and about, gay people of color became increasingly visible in the West. The fact that \"Exiles\" is now showing in India, where he said it is positively received, is testament to changes on the subcontinent, too.A shot from the \"Exiles\" series.Although the country's LGBTQ communities still face significant social stigma, gay sex wasdecriminalized in 2018and the arrival of apps like Grindr have been transformative, Gupta said. (\"Those sorts of chance meetings behind the bush are not happening \u2014 or maybe happening less,\" he added). This modern context and the power of hindsight have helped paint the photos in a new light.Open-source encyclopedia puts 10,000 years of Indian art history in one place\"I think it has become historical enough that people are curious about what gay life was like before Grindr and the internet,\" Gupta said. \"People think it was all doom and gloom, and people jumping off buildings. They don't seem to appreciate that we also managed to have some kind of a life back then.\"This is a message reflected in the photographer's carefree India Gate shoot, which he recounts as a relaxed day of fun and abundant sunlight.\"It just seemed very pleasurable. It was a nice day out, and I got to hang out with these guys who were having a good time and having a laugh.\""

        "text": "Written byInSnap, we look at the power of a single photograph, chronicling stories about how both modern and historical images have been made.A young man stands grinning in Beijing's Forbidden City. It's the dead of winter, and one of his hands is buried deep into the pockets of his long overcoat to protect it from the chill. The other grasps the unmistakable contours of a glass Coca-Cola bottle.Today, Coke is the world's most famous soft drink and can be found just about anywhere. But back in 1981, when the image was shot by Pulitzer-Prize winning photographer Liu Heung Shing, it was only just getting into the hands of ordinary Chinese people.Liu, who was in his late 20s when he began working for Time magazine in Beijing, felt the country was on the cusp of a great cultural shift following the death of Mao Zedong in 1976.\"The changes (at first) were subtle, and unless you lived there, you wouldn't have noticed,\" he recalled during an interview at his home in Hong Kong.The 'Blue Marble': One of Earth's most iconic images, 50 years onHe had earlier photographed people grieving for Mao along the banks of the Pearl River in Guangzhou. It was here that he was struck by how differently people carried themselves compared to what he had seen in late-1950s China, where he grew up during the disastrous Great Leap Forward campaign \u2014 a series of failed industrialization policies \u2014 before moving back to Hong Kong as a child.Under Mao, the country went on to suffer from widespread famine and poverty, and the tumultuous years of the Cultural Revolution. But in the aftermath of the Chinese leader's death, Liu said, \"suddenly, people's steps looked a little bit lighter, they dropped their shoulders and their faces looked more relaxed.\"It would prove to be a relatively liberal period in Chinese history \u2014 politically, economically and in terms of everyday life, which Liu captured in candid shots. One photo from the time showed a plastic surgeon and his client after a cosmetic procedure. Another depicted people gathering at a \"Democracy Wall\" in Beijing, where they wrote now-unthinkable criticisms of the government.One of Liu's most iconic images was captured on his way into the Time bureau after he had the strange feeling that something was \"missing.\" He turned his car around and, sure enough, a large portrait of Mao that had once hung prominently on a building had been freshly taken down. He quickly shotimagesof workers gathered around the depiction of the late Chairman, with some of their scaffolding visible in the frame.This was China \"moving out of the shadow of Mao,\" he said.In December 1978, Coca-Cola became the first foreign enterprise permitted to enter the mainland Chinese market since the communist revolution. That same month, Beijing and Washington announced the normalization of Sino-American relations and Deng Xiaoping kick-started China's transformative economic reforms with his \"Open Door\" policy. (Coca-Cola was first introduced to China in the 1920s but had been forced to leave in 1949, along with other foreign companies, by a government that regarded it as bourgeois).Liu had photographed the opening of a joint-venture bottling plant in Beijing, capturing Coke chairman Roberto Goizueta and Chinese trade officials drinking Coca Cola and holding bottles aloft to cries of \"ganbei\" (cheers). He then thought to himself, \"Now where do I find a (regular) Chinese person enjoying this (drink)?\"He headed to the Forbidden City, with its heavy flow of tourists, and soon found a man named Zhang Wei purchasing a Coke from a small stand.\"I remember he made a comment when he drank this syrupy Coke: 'It tastes so-so'\" said Liu, who ended up taking a few shots with one of the imperial palace's picturesque pavilions in the background.Forbidden City at 600: How China's imperial palace survived against the oddsThe response to Coke itself may have been underwhelming, but the snap perfectly captured the curiosity and openness many Chinese people felt at the time.\"As a photographer, I of course realized the significance. That this man, dressed in a ubiquitous PLA (People's Liberation Army) coat, was one of the very first people to taste it,\" he said, adding: \"But I didn't realize it would become part of the Chinese collective memory.\"The image would be widely published and displayed in the following years, and he later became friends with Zhang. In 1983, it appeared in Liu's photography book \"China after Mao,\" a collection of images taken between 1976 and 1982. More recently he included it in hisbook\"Liu Heung Shing: A Life in a Sea of Red.\"Striking photos document the collapse -- and evolution -- of 20th century communismThe photographer would go on to document other periods and profound events in the country's modern history, including the 1989Tiananmen Square crackdown. And just like those pictures of young student activists calling for democracy, Liu's Coca-Cola photograph feels part of another era altogether.With its apparent embrace of the new and the foreign \u2014 ideas encapsulated in that most American of drinks \u2014 the image stands in stark contrast to today's China, where relations with the US are at an all-time low. Xi Jinping's nationalist agenda has generated increasingly xenophobic attitudes towards the West.\"I realized that the story I did in the last quarter of the 20th century (would) continue to carry relevance into the 21st century,\" Liu said.\"Especially with the story of China, I never doubt that these photographs are in the Chinese people's collective memory.\"Even though this memory keeps being re-edited... the good thing about a photograph, is you cannot re-edit it. It becomes an image seared in people's minds.\"A version of this story appeared in CNN's Meanwhile in China newsletter, a three-times-a-week update exploring what you need to know about the country's rise and how it impacts the world.

        "link": "https://edition.cnn.com/style/article/icon-3d-printing-architecture-initiative-99-project-olympus-spc-intl-scn/index.html",
        "text": "Written byJason Ballard, the CEO and co-founder of 3D printing architecture company ICON, doesn't mince his words. \"There are certain people who are content to build a really ugly or uninspiring world,\" he said. \"We're not. The day I walk outside and see something ugly being built by one of my robots -- that's a nightmare scenario for me.\"Ballard, a quick-talking Texan in a 10-gallon hat, has a vision for the future of architecture.  Others are buying into it. Since launching in 2017, Austin-based ICON has received close to half a billion dollars in funding, won a contract with NASA and paired up with influential architects like Bjarke Ingels. If all goes according to plan, ICON will be building on the moon before the end of the decade.But first, the CEO wanted to discuss a moonshot much closer to home.ICON made its name creating houses using a high strength concrete it calls \"Lavacrete,\" printed in layers to form walls. A large machine ICON named the \"Vulcan\" does the printing, fed by an on-site mixing system dubbed \"Magma.\"The company'sfirst housewas unveiled in 2018, and since then its operations have scaled up, froma collection of six homesin 2020 toa 100-home community north of Austincurrently under construction (the largest printed community in the US). At each stage, the footprint of properties has increased, from 350 square feet to over 2,000 square feet, as the technology has advanced and 3D-printed homes have moved from prototype to novelty to relatively mainstream.ICON's award-winning \"House Zero\" was printed in less than two weeks and designed to push the boundaries of sustainability, say the company.A thread running through ICON's work is building homes for disadvantaged people, including accommodation for the long-term homeless, often in collaboration with non-profits. Creating affordable housing is also an objective, which led the company to launch design competitionInitiative 99last month.Initiative 99 seeks submissions for homes that can be 3D-printed for $99,000 or less. Ballard described it as \"a call to arms for the global architecture and design community\" to get to grips with \"one of the most pressing industries in need of a rethink.\"A survey conducted by thePew Research Centerin 2021 found about half of Americans reported affordable housing was a \"major problem\" in their area. One estimate from late 2020 calculated the US had a housing supply deficit of3.8 million units.Peggy Bailey is vice president of housing and income security at progressive US think tank the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. Bailey explained that in the US, many people struggle to pay for their accommodation. \"Even before the pandemic and economic downturn, 23 million people lived in 11 million low-income households that paid more than 50% of their income for rent,\" she told CNN via email.\"Innovative ways to build housing are a promising step toward creating more affordable housing,\" she added, while cautioning, \"the housing affordability crisis isn't due to a single issue or event. Multifaceted problems require multifaceted solutions.\"Wolf Ranch, a 100-home community north of Austin, Texas, is under construction and will be the largest 3D-printed housing project in the US.The idea for Initiative 99 came from an internal exercise ICON has run every six months for the past five years, to see what can be constructed for $99,000 with the technology available. \"This year we hit an inflection point,\" said Ballard. \"The results were very compelling. It immediately dawned on all of us (that) we've got to tell everybody about this.\"The ICON CEO said Initiative 99's $1 million prize fund will be the largest ever for an affordable housing competition. The competition will launch on May 23 and run for a year, with stages for concept development, schematic design and design development. There will be multiple winners and their designs will be built by ICON.Ballard hopes the competition receives entries tailored to meet cultures and contexts around the world, addressing specific needs and challenges.Bailey suggested the success of 3D-printed housing could hinge on how it is perceived by prospective residents. \"One thing to keep in mind with any innovation in housing development, including 3D-development ... is that the housing must fit in the rental market and be of the quality and style that any person would want to live in,\" she said.Ballard said all ICON's projects feed into one another: for example, the systems monitoring and support software it will use in the Initiative 99 homes was developed as part of its Project Olympus initiative, which is investigating building 3D-printed structures on the moon.Lunar concept designs, created in collaboration with Bjarke Ingles Group, werereleased in 2020, and in November 2022 ICON was awarded a$57 millioncontract byNASA, which will culminate in testing on the moon.Instead of Lavacrete, ICON is experimenting with using lunar regolith, the mineral-rich dust and rock that covers the moon's surface. The regolith can be melted with a laser and turned into a ceramic-like material that is hard, durable and radiation-absorbing, explained Ballard.Parts of the construction system have been tested in a vacuum, and will next be tested in simulated lunar gravity, before being sent to the moon in 2026 or 2027, he added. The CEO stressed there are no plans for a lunar base yet, but ICON's tests will represent a significant step in that direction.ICON's Project Olympus will see a construction system built by the company on the moon later this decade.Some of ICON's lunar ideas could find a civilian context too. Ballard is conscious that Lavacrete contains cement, which has a large carbon footprint, and said that ICON is researching ways to utilize locally sourced building materials on Earth that can compete with concrete.Patti Harburg-Petrich, principal at engineering consultancy Buro Happold, noted that some companies are already printing with materials other than concrete. The firm consulted on Mighty Buildings' award-winningMighty House, in California, which utilized prefabricated, 3D-printed composite stone material for its walls.She argued there was a strong case for 3D-printing's sustainability credentials. \"Oftentimes 3D-printed homes can be built faster and more sustainably when compared to traditional construction,\" Harburg-Petrich said via email, pointing to a reduction in building materials wasted in construction.In recent years, there has been growing ambition around 3D-printing. Dubai, in the United Arab Emirates, aims to have 25% of new buildings constructed with 3D-printing technology by 2030, and the city is home tothe world's largest 3D-printed structure by volume-- a two-story local government office built by Apis Cor in 2019.Thefirst multi-story 3D-printed buildingin the US was unveiled in September 2022, andthe tallest 3D-printed building in the worldis a 9.9 meter (32.5 foot), three-story house in Saudi Arabia, completed last November -- both realized using printing technology by Danish company COBOD.Completed in late 2019, Apis Cor created the walls for what is currently largest 3D-printed building in the world by volume of material. It was formed with a mobile 3D printer and designed to withstand harsh climatic conditions.COBOD is responsible for what it claims is the tallest 3D-printed building in the world, a three-story house in Saudi Arabia.Ballard says ICON is also planning to print multi-story buildings, and has triplex and quadplex designs in the works. ICON is developing the next generation of its Vulcan printing system, capable of building much bigger projects, Ballard said, adding that the company aims to eventually create a system in which three or four machines can be operated by a single person. \"You should expect it to be a lot faster, you should expect it to be a lot more autonomous,\" he added.This thinking comes as the design and construction sectors in the US face a skilled labor shortage, noted Harburg-Petrich. Along with more affordable and transportable 3D-printing systems, in the future, \"we also need a workforce that is adaptable to 3D-printed construction technology,\" she said.The next generation of ICON's Vulcan printing system is in development.3D-construction at scale, with an emphasis on affordable housing, is where Ballard wants to take ICON. In the case of Initiative 99, the winning designs will be released for free, meaning anyone with the tools can create the houses themselves.\"I feel like the future can be amazing,\" said Ballard. \"But I'm also haunted by this understanding of history and human behavior, because it's not guaranteed to be amazing. We have to make it so. And we're going to have to take some risks to make it so.\""

        "text": "Written byThe design world's largest annual fair enjoyed a return to full pre-pandemic form with its 2023 showcase, transforming the city of Milan with hundreds of exhibitions, site-specific installations, pop-ups and public projects.'Fuorisalone,' the network of city-wide events that runs alongside the main trade show offered a series of compelling new ideas from the creative realm, from home furnishings to socially-driven projects. Shows took place in traditional gallery and showroom settings, grand palazzi not usually open to the public and also in private apartments and even an abandoned abattoir. Almost everywhere, the focus was on sustainable design, circular economy, material innovation and artistry combining craft with innovation.Countering the rise of artificial intelligence in the art and design world, a number of creatives turned their attention to artisanship and traditional craft -- albeit often integrating new technologies and 3D printing in their works.At \"Tools & Crafts\" a show held at non-profit space Fondazione Riccardo Catella, UK-based textile studio Woven Memories presented hand-woven cushions that incorporated digital coding into the design to fuse text with pattern and create \"pieces of memory;\" while Lebanese-Armenian designer Nareg Krikorian displayed handmade leather stools featuring exaggerated stitching and details to  honor Armenian craftsmanship.Lebanese-Armenian designer Nareg Krikorian showed handmade leather stools.A vast former slaughterhouse provided the venue for this year's Alcova (an itinerant and independent exhibition that changes venue every year) where Italian wallpaper company Fabscarte and artist Martyn Thompson wrapped an entire room in a moon-inspired, three-dimensional wallcovering handcrafted using copper and bronze powder. Nearby,Within the same space, Natalia Triantafylli and Andrew Scott of London-based designers N/A collaborated on a collection of objects incorporating 3D printed plastic, ceramic and sheet steel, with every single element, from bolts to hinges, made by hand -- an effort to spotlight the uniqueness of handmade products and the importance of the maker's touch in contemporary design.Also at Alcova, Korean designer Sangmin Oh debuted \"The Knitted Light,\" a series of sculptural lamps made with traditional fishing lines and elastic yarns that respond to light in different ways, exploring the possibilities of 3D knitting -- just like the works of Dutch collective Basketclub, which showcased a series of experimental, woven 3D objects aimed at bridging the physical act of braiding with unconventional materials.Sangmin Oh explored 3D knitting with pieces made from fishing lines and elastic yarns.Craftsmanship also shone at events organized by big fashion brands  \u2014 many of who are now regular fixtures alongside the event's more established architecture and design names.Tod's invited British fashion photographer Tim Walker to showcase the artistry behind some of the label's most iconic items -- from the Di Bag to the Gommino loafer -- with an exhibition at the stately Museo Nazionale della Scienza e della Tecnologia Leonardo da Vinci. Loewe displayed a collection of chairs constructed by the house's skilled craftspeople at Palazzo Isimbardi; Hermes presented an edit of mid-century-inspired furniture pieces that included mouth-blown table lamps designed by Finnish designer Harri Koskinen, hand-embroidered carpets and upholstered wooden chairs.At Bottega Veneta, Italian design legend Gaetano Pesce was tasked with designing two hand-crafted handbags, which were displayed as part of an installation called \"Vieni a Vedere\" (Come and See) inside the brand's flagship store. Individually painted with an airbrush technique, each tote featured the house's signature Intrecciato weave showing two mountains with a sunrise or a sunset behind -- a nod to the mountains of Este, where Pesce spent his childhood, and the prairies of America, where he lives today.Engaging colors and textures were as predominant as artisanship during the week   perhaps another nod to the fact that, despite increasingly digital lifestyles, we are still very much yearning for real-life experiences.At Alcova, Greek designer Kiki Goti reimagined the dressing room as a space for personal transformation with the maximalist series \"Neo-Vanity,\" which featured a pendant light, a side table, a modular mirror, and a standing vanity in vivid colors, Balkan-inspired patterns and unexpected materials like foam.Kiki Goti's maximalist series explored multifunctional home objects in vivid colors.Design brand Chef Deco turned kettlebells, yoga carpets and meditation cushions into vibrant, multifunctional home objects, while at new exhibiting space Convey, Italian designer Marco Ripa and Swedish studio Stamuli leaned on ultraviolet fluorescent lighting rays and color-blocking respectively for their collections, displaying furnishings that felt pop, bold, and fun.Within the stunning location of Bagni Misteriosi, a 1930s lido and cultural center in the city's Porta Romana neighborhood, Danish furniture company Gubi explored the possibilities of play with \"TEN: Beyond the Beetle,\" a show to celebrate the 10th anniversary of its iconic Beetle Chair. The brand asked 10 international artists and designers to reinterpret the classic seat through their own preferred medium, with a sound installation, an artwork, a ceramic vase and a deconstructed version of the Beetle made with recycled fabrics among the results.Elsewhere, French brand Roche Bobois presented the sculpture-like sofa \"Bombom\" by Portuguese artist Joana Vasconcelos, which featured pastel layered hues and backrests that rotate to allow people to sit in different directions; the young Croatian designer Ana Koruga debuted \"Objects for Movement\" -- a series of eight home items with purposely unstable bases aimed to engage users in active, more physically-aware living.Sustainability was a common theme at this year's fair, and it showed across the work of younger designers and household names. Some of the most interesting ideas were those that looked at waste -- literally -- to rethink what design can do when it uses what is already there.At \"Tools & Crafts,\" Dutch designer Kick Veldman invited people to look at their reflections in the trash they have produced by creating mirrors made from waste aluminum, while at exhibition space Dropcity, Japanese designer Daisuke Yamamoto presented a furniture collection made entirely of lightweight gauge steel, a commonly used and disposed of building material.More discarded materials shone at Alcova, where Taiwanese creative Erco Lai displayed ceramic 3D printed pieces next to homewares made with material waste collected from factories in The Hague, where he's based.Similarly, Californian PROWL Studio and M4 Factory, which specializes in regenerative plastic goods, tackled the issue of fast furniture with the PEEL Chair, a reimagining of the ubiquitous plastic stacking chair made from hemp bast fiber -- a byproduct of hemp and cannabis industrial processing that typically goes to waste. Shown in various stages of decomposition, the chair challenged viewers to approach products with the end of their lifecycle in mind."

Here are the key takeawaysStrategy and consulting firmSimon Kucher's Global Sustainability Study 2021found 60% of consumers around the world rated sustainability as an important purchase criterion, and 35% were willing to pay more for sustainable products or services.This shift in consumer preferences has propelledmany beauty brands to set environmental goals: to move away fromsingle-use and virgin plastics, provide recyclable, reusable and refillable packaging and offer more transparency around products' ingredients so customers can ascertain how \"green\" their purchase is.However, consumers still struggle to understand the sustainability credentials of many products, according to the British Beauty Council. This is because the industry's clean-up efforts have been inconsistent, and fall short of making a recognizable impact in the absence of collective goal-setting, global strategy and standardized regulations.There is no international standard for the beauty industry on how much product ingredient information to share with customers \u2014 or how to do so. Brands can set their own rules and goals, giving rise to confusion and\"greenwashing,\"where sustainability claims are often touted but not substantiated.Companies often use marketing language like\"clean beauty\"to make it seem like their products are natural, for example, when they may not actually be organic, sustainable or ethically made.After rebranding in the West, many beauty companies are still offering to 'whiten' skin elsewhere\"The term 'clean beauty' has become quite dangerous. It's used to sell more products,\" according to British Beauty Council CEO Millie Kendall, who added that such buzzwords are losing traction in the UK as British customers wise up to their shortcomings. \"Customers need better marketing information and certification information.\"In a2021 report calling on the industry to have \"the courage to change\"their business practices, the British Beauty Council wrote that, all too often, even natural ingredients involved in manufacturing products give way to \"over-consumption, non-regenerative farming practices, pollution, waste and neglect.\"\"The only way out of this is transparency,\" Kendall told CNN.Jen Lee, chief impact officer at US-based brand Beautycounter, said she continues to see confusion over ingredients among consumers. (In 2013, the company launched and published \"The Never List,\" which currently cites more than 2,800 chemicals \u2014including heavy metals, parabens and formaldehyde\u2014 it claims to never use in its products.)\"Natural vs. synthetic ingredients has been a conversation. People think natural is safer, but it's not always the case,\" Lee explained. \"Natural ingredients formulated in the industry can have toxic load. Heavy metals can occur in natural components of the earth.\"Mother loses peripheral vision from apparent exposure to mercury in beauty creams. Toxic levels in her home put family at risk, say experts\"We used to be more natural and organic,\" added Sasha Plavsic, founder of makeup brand ILIA Beauty. \"What was challenging is (that) raw materials were difficult to source or would come in inconsistently or products wouldn't perform.\"Most makeup is created and molded at high temperatures, Plavsic explained. Purely organic materials often fall apart in this heat, leading to inconsistent results and subpar product performance. \"Not every synthetic is bad,\" Plavsic said. \"Sometimes, it helps create the best in class formula.\"The industry's plastic packaging isa particular sustainability challenge\u2014 95% is thrown away and the vast majority is not recycled, according to the British Beauty Council.The cosmetics business is the fourth biggest plastic packaging user globally \u2014 after food and beverage, industrial packaging and pharmaceuticals \u2014 and plastic is about 67% of the industry's packaging volume, according to Vantage Market Research. Beauty giant L'Oreal used144,430 metric tons of plasticin its packaging material in 2021, for example, according to the Ellen Macarthur Foundation (EMF). Estee Lauder Companies reported its brands produced 71,600 metric tons of plastic in product packaging that same year.And only 9% of the global plastic waste is recycled, according to a report from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. The United Statesonly recycles 4% of its plastic waste.Single-use plastic is wreaking havoc on the planet. Here's what you can do to minimize your impactMany brands are trying to phase out harmful plastics from their operations and adopt post-consumer recycled (PCR) plastic. (L'Oreal has set a target of 50% PCR plastic usage by 2025, while Estee Lauder is targeting 25% \"or more\" PCR plastic \u2014 but both are far from achieving their targets.)\"Between 60-70 major global brands have made unprecedented progress\" in PCR plastic usage across industries, EMF's Plastic Initiative Lead Sander DeFruyt told CNN. But DeFruyt stressed that PCR plastic must be adopted in conjunction with brands removing single and virgin plastics from their usage cycles to truly make a difference.However, PCR plastic is not easy to find \u2014 low recycling rates around the world mean there is limited supply. Meanwhile, demand for it is growing demand across industries, DeFruyt said. This competition hikes up its price, which is already higher than virgin plastic.Hair care brand FEKKAI claims that it used up to 95% PCR content in its packaging, but pricing and supply issues posed a challenge, forcing it to currently aim for containers and packaging that feature at least 50% PCR in its packaging.\"PCR plastic is more expensive than stock plastic. The cost is hard and then sourcing it is too,\" founder Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Fekkai told CNN. \"PCR is close to our heart, but there is a massive demand, so finding recycled plastic is difficult.\"Beauty retailers plays a pivotal \u2014 and under-utilized \u2014 role, with control over stocking decisions and supply chains. But many vary when it comes to the standards they set for brands they sell.\"Smaller businesses do more, full stop,\" said Jessi Baker, founder of the technology platform Provenance, which helps brands display their sustainability credentials for customers. \"They move more nimbly. Some of them are born-good brands \u2014 climate friendliness was part of their setup. They don't need to restructure their entire supply chain. Their culture already has it compared to the larger brands who need to work hard to change.\"A history of beauty trends -- and the standards that shaped themSephora launched its \"Clean + Planet Positive\" initiative in 2021, which labeled products that met its set criteria. (This is separate from the French retailer's \"Clean at Sephora\" program, which is currently facing a consumer lawsuit alleging it carries a significant percentage of products understood by customers to be harmful.) Target launched a similar program in 2022, featuring a \"Target Zero\" icon for both online and in-store offerings that either have reusable, recyclable, compostable or reduced plastic packaging, or feature waterless or concentrated products.Still, many steps taken by brands and retailers do not even begin to touch on the waste and pollution generatedthroughout supply chains, manufacturing and shipping, all huge problems for the industry to grapple with.The gaps in standardization in the beauty ecosystem can, to some extent, be filled by certifications such as the US-bornB Corporation, or B Corp. This accreditation, one of the most well-known in the beauty space, is issued by the non-profit B Lab, which scores a company on a variety of criteria around ethics and sustainability. However beneficial it may be amongeco-conscious consumers, though, it is currently completely voluntary for brands to apply for.Governments and multinationals enforcing regulations and setting a base line for brands to operate from when making sustainability claims would go a long way to making change, many experts and business leaders believe.Susanne Kaufmann, founder of her namesake beauty brand, says her efforts in Austria would reap better results if more countries around the world had stricter, more uniform garbage disposal laws.A trash heap 62 meters high shows the scale of India's climate challenge\"I package our product in a recyclable material,\" Kaufmann said. (Her products' packaging, which is refillable and reusable, is made from 75% recycled plastic \u2014 and is 100% recyclable.) If I send this to the US, the garbage is not separated... and it's not recyclable,\" she explained, referring to inconsistencies in recycling laws across the United States.And when it comes to ingredients, the European Chemicals Agencylists 2,495 substancesbanned from use in cosmetic products marketed for sale or use in the bloc. But the US Food and Drug administrationonly lists 11, making it more challenging for American consumers to find safer, greener options. The Environmental Working Group, a non-profit watchdog, studiedlab tests of 51 sunscreen productsin 2021 and found that only 35% of products met the EU standard, compared with 94% that passed the US standard.However, while government can set minimum requirements, Mia Davis, vice president of sustainability and impact at beauty retailer Credo Beauty, says the needle will move in the private sector.Sustainable ships: The world's most eco-conscious cruises\"Regulation can raise the floor a bit. A person who doesn't know about any (sustainability issues) should still be able to walk into a bodega and get clean products... But that's never going to be what the market can do,\" she said. \"Market leadership is key.\"In the absence of bold regulations or global standards on sustainability practices, this \"leadership\" \u2014 undertaken both by brands and customers in the beauty marketplace \u2014 is likely to be the most immediately impactful vector for addressing the industry's climate shortcomings. It will take continued collective advocacy and initiative to see meaningful climate-conscious change."

        "link": "https://edition.cnn.com/style/article/marina-tabassum-architect-bangladesh-hnk-spc-intl/index.html",
        "text": "Written byContributorsAmong the stretching plains of Bangladesh's river deltas, the Khudi Bari looks small.The two-story structure resembles a free-standing treehouse, with a pitched roof covering a platform that balances on spindly legs. Its name means \"tiny house\" in Bengali, and its thin bamboo frame looks frail against the rolling yellow fields and the swirling tides splashing against the river bank.While the humble dwelling looks fragile, it's the landscape that is delicate. Along these river deltas, the map changes every few years, with riverbank erosion causing islands, known as chars, to rise and fall with the seasons.\"A lot of people lose their land. A lot of towns have vanished into the water,\" said Marina Tabassum.  The award-winning founder ofMarina Tabassum Architects(MTA) wanted to find a solution for these landless people, who are frequently forced to move to escape flooding.\"They need to move the moment the sand bed starts to vanish,\" said Tabassum. \"The idea was that they should be able to move with their structure.\"Lightweight and modular, the Khudi Bari is designed to be folded down, packed up and relocated, while still able to withstand heavy wind and rain -- a steady presence in a transitory lifestyle.This award-winning architect is building flat-pack, flood-proof homesBangladesh isone of the world's most vulnerable countriesto climate change, and experiences severe monsoons and flooding for several months every year.\"The coastal areas of Bangladesh, where we are facing the sea level rise and the changing biodiversity and ecology, those areas need a lot of attention,\" said Tabassum.She and her team began researching the needs of these communities back in 2018, but it wasn't until the pandemic hit -- and many other projects ground to a halt -- that they had time to fully explore the idea of what this temporary structure might look like.\"A city and its health is defined by how good your public spaces are. That really contributes to the mental and physical health of the inhabitants.\"Marina Tabassum, ArchitectWorking through a variety of ideas, the team chose bamboo as the principal material. Locally available, cheap, durable, and lightweight, it is easy to move and carry. Fastened with steel joints and metal corner braces for strength, the structure can be easily assembled and disassembled with minimal labor.Unlike many other temporary structures, the Khudi Bari has two levels. The ground floor is built on compact earth, and walls can be made with any locally found material, such as corrugated iron or woven bamboo, or it can be left open for agricultural storage. The second floor, which can sleep up to four people, is six feet from the ground and accessed by a stepladder, offering a safe space to shelter during flooding.Tabassum's compassion for the landless perhaps comes from her own family history and upbringing. The grandchild of immigrants, Tabassum's family hails from Malda, in West Bengal, India. They left their hometown during the Hindu-Muslim riots that began afterpartition in 1947-- and the war and famine of Bangladesh's early years, after gaining independence in 1971, was the backdrop of Tabassum's childhood.Tabassum says the Bait Ur Rouf Mosque (pictured) has a \"special place in her heart\" as it was commissioned by her late grandmother.These early experiences have informed her architectural practice. \"Architecture grows from the land, so if you want to root it in its place, then you have to have a deep understanding of where it's located,\" she said.Throughout her nearly three-decade career, she has designed some of the country's most noted landmarks, including the Museum of Independence Monument, and the Aga Khan Award-winning Bait Ur Rouf Mosque.Tabassum said that during her university studies, the curriculum was filled with works designed by foreign architects -- so she was determined to create \"a language of architecture which is of Bengal, of Bangladesh.\"This 'zero waste' Japanese building is made from 700 donated windowsInfluenced by the work of late American architect Louis Kahn, and his student, Bangladeshi architect Muzharul Islam, Tabassum's style is one of simplicity, playing with light and dark and the contrast of lines and shapes to create dynamic spaces that blend interiors with the natural world beyond.In addition to the Aga Khan Award in 2016, Tabassum's work has been further recognized, winning the Soane Medal in 2021, and most recently, celebrated in asolo exhibition at the TUM Museum of Architecture in Munich.Her work focuses on local, historical materials, like red brick and bamboo -- which has the additional benefit of reducing costs and carbon emissions associated with transport and the supply chain.Shying away from commercial projects, Tabassum takes inspiration from her father, who was the only doctor in the neighborhood where she grew up, and pursues architecture that supports the community, and responds to crisis and need.Tabassum uses light as ornamentation in the Bait Ur Rouf Mosque; a constellation of holes in the ceiling create an invisible chandelier, casting a kaleidoscope of light across the floor.\"I really love designing public projects, especially places where people gather,\" she said. \"A city and its health is defined by how good your public spaces are. That really contributes to the mental and physical health of the inhabitants -- in that respect, I think we still have some way to go.\"To facilitate the distribution and building of the Khudi Bari, Tabassum founded a non-profit branch of her firm called FACE (Foundation for Architecture, Community, Equity) that could help provide proper shelter and living conditions for marginalized groups such as climate refugees, nomadic communities, and low-income populations.In 2021, the Khudi Bari project received a grant from the Embassy of Switzerland in Bangladesh to fund its first 100 tiny houses, which cost roughly $450 each to build. Through community workshops and engagement events in rural communities, Tabassum said the team selects families who are \"more deserving\" of a new home.\"Architecture of people, where people live, it's always been something which is a constantly evolving process.\"Marina Tabassum, ArchitectThe beneficiaries range from widows trying to provide for their children, to those struggling to make ends meet because of lifelong disability. So far, FACE has built 40 of these tiny homes, in the southern coastal chars of Chandpur, as well as the northern, flood-prone communities of Kurigram and Sunamganj.\"The idea is not to build the entire village,\" said Tabassum. \"We are building these houses to see how the buildings react to the climate, but at the same time, how people appropriate it.\"FACE is not just building these tiny homes for the sand-shifting communities on the chars. On Bangladesh's border with Myanmar, around one million Rohingya refugees live in Cox's Bazaar. Refugee camps are not allowed to build permanent structures or lay foundations, so Tabassum's team has adapted the modular Khudi Bari to create homes and community space there. \"Everybody has a right to good architecture,\" she added.Tabassum has adapted the Khudi Bari structure to create larger community spaces at the Rohingya refugee camp at Cox's Bazaar.\"Because of the climate crisis, because of the sea level rise, and all the different unpredictable phenomena that are happening around us, it's important to not create something too permanent,\" Tabassum said. \"I don't believe that every building needs to last a hundred years.\"\"Architecture of people, where people live, it's always been something which is a constantly evolving process,\" she added. \"It never sought permanence. And so it's sort of ephemeral in its quality and its character.\""

The 10-floor limestone building, originally erected in the early 1940's, hopes to re-establish itself as a landmark of Manhattan after a four-year architectural revamp.Look of the Week: Are we about to see more men in tights?Out on the robin-egg blue carpet, there wasn't a croissant nor a cigarette holder in sight \u2014 but the vision was still clear as day. It was the night of the little black dress (LBD) \u2014 championed by models Hailey Bieber, Nicola Peltz Beckham, actors Gal Gadot, Bruna Marquezine and Gold medal-winning skier Eileen Gu (among others). The army of inky cocktail dresses were, of course, in reference to Blake Edward's 1961 film \"Breakfast at Tiffany's,\" andAudrey Hepburn's elegant on-screen uniformof a slinky black satin gown.Hailey Bieber looked straight out off \"Breakfast at Tiffany's\" with her Versace LBD and sunglasses.At the celebration, every rendition of the LBD was unique. Bieber's otherwise classic black midi pencil dress, hot off the Versace Fall-Winter 2023 runway, featured a space-age inverted moon neckline and chunky, tube-shaped straps. Her manicure matched the color of a Tiffany's jewelry box. \"Hailey Golightly,\" wrote one fan on Instagram.At first glance, Gadot's strapless black velvet cocktail number looks like an innocuous 1950s hoop-skirted gown \u2014 until you catch her profile.

But Marquezine opted for a more faithful iteration \u2014 digging into the Yves Saint Laurent archive to do so. Her Fall-Winter 1983 haute couture gown featured a drop waist, asymmetrical tulle skirt and a strapless velvet bodice.Bruna Marquezine opted for an archival Yves Saint Laurent from 1983.The most notable LBD, as worn by Hepburn when playing the role of Holly Golightly, was created by Hubert de Givenchy and costume designer Edith Head. But black, mid-length and fitted had long been the formula for achieving subtle, understated sex appeal. Created by Coco Chanel in the 1920s, Vogue dubbed the original LBD (a knee-length dress made from crepe de Chine) \"Chanel's Ford\" in prediction of its enormous success. The concept spread across storied fashion houses such as Dior and Givenchy in the mid 20th century.Hepburn's LBD in the 1961 movie cemented the garment in pop culture.Over a century later, the time-honored garment lives on through fresh takes, reimaginings and designers looking to subverting expectations. The LBD is its own sartorial landmark \u2014 full of a rich history, but always open to visitors.Look of the Week: Blackpink headline Coachella in Korean hanboks"

Officially called the Costume Institute Benefit, it takes place at the Metropolitan Museum of Art onthe first Monday in May, with guests dressed in keeping with the gala's theme (or ignoring it altogether).This year, the dress code is \"In honor of Karl,\" a tribute toKarl Lagerfeld, the late fashion juggernaut with an indelible influence but controversial reputation. All eyes will be on the red carpet to see how guests interpret Lagerfeld's complicated legacy \u2014 as well as if hisbeloved tortie cat, Choupette, will strut up the museum's frontsteps.Lagerfeld with his cat and muse, Choupette, at an exhibition dedicated to his feline companion in 2015.Co-chairingthis year's event are actors Michaela Coel and Pen\u00e9lope Cruz, tennis giant Roger Federer, singer Dua Lipa and, as always, Vogue's editorial director Anna Wintour.Lagerfeld's career will also be explored in the Costume Institute's spring exhibition \"Karl Lagerfeld: A Line of Beauty,\" opening to the public the following day.Look of the Week: Apple Martin looks every bit the 'Chanel girl'Serving as creative director of the storied French fashion house Chanel from 1983 until his death in February 2019, as well as the luxury Italian house Fendi from 1965, the German fashion designer loomed tall within the fashion industry. He left his mark on Chlo\u00e9, Patou and Balmain as well over the course of his long career, working with each fashion house in different capacities (in addition to his own eponymous label), and has influenced countless others.His final Fendi collection was shown at Milan Fashion Week just days after his death, with models including Gigi and Bella Hadid and Kaia Gerber walking the runway. The following month, Cruz made her runway debut at his final Chanel presentation.Anna Wintour and Karl Lagerfeld at the Met Gala afterparty in 2008.Vintage throwbacks to Lagerfeld collections are likely to reign on Monday \u2014 as well as nods to his imitable suited-and-gloved personal style. Lagerfeld's collections were not known for any one hallmark \u2014 besides luxury; he was revered for the transformative power he had at each house with which he worked. His oft-repeated yet unsavoryquote on taking over the House of Chanel was: \"Chanel is an institution, and you have to treat an institution like a wh**e \u2014 and then you get something out of her.\"10 celebrity outfits that won the red carpet in 2022In his orbit were some of fashion and entertainment's biggest names, including Kate Moss, Linda Evangelista, Claudia Schiffer, Pharrell, Keira Knightley, Naomi Campbell and Cara Delevingne, some of whom will undoubtedly walk the red carpet this year. Younger models who have carried the Chanel torch, passed down from their mothers, include Gerber (daughter to Cindy Crawford) and Lily Rose-Depp (daughter to Vanessa Paradis).Lagerfeld's influence and star-making power was undeniable, but over the years he made a number ofdisparaging statementsthat upheld thin ideals or cast criticism on the #MeToo movement at a time when the fashion industry was facing a reckoning. Whether or not all Met Gala guests will emphasize Lagerfeld in a positive light, or choose to make more subversive statements, remains to be seen. Last year, as many showed up in opulent garments fit for the Gilded Era for the theme \"Gilded Glamour\" some celebrities, including Gabrielle Union and Riz Ahmed,opted to honorcommunities who were marginalized during the period of runaway American wealth.Lizzo's standout \"Gilded Glamour\" look included a flute performance.Last October, actor and body positivity advocate Jameela Jamilcalledthe theme \"a disappointing double standard\" in the industry, pointing out on social media that Lagerfeld's comments were recent. \"It's really weird when someone gets a completely free pass and I don't want to be a part of that.\"The gala's themes are chosen based on the Costume Institute's new exhibitions. While past themes have explored highly conceptual or region-specific motifs, from \"Heavenly Bodies: Fashion and the Catholic Imagination\" in 2018 to \"China: Through the Looking Glass\" in 2015, individual designers have been honored, too.

        "text": "Written byKeeping you in the know,Culture Queueis an ongoing series of recommendations for timely books to read, films to watch and podcasts and music to listen to.When Pip Harry first got her period at 11, her mother handed her pads and a copy of Judy Blume's \"Are You There, God? It's Me, Margaret.\"The seminal coming-of-age novel, which tells the story of sixth grader Margaret Simon who's anxious for her body to mature and conflicted about religion, has been a cultural touchstone for generations of girls and women. Harry's mother read it when it was first published in 1970 before sharing it with preteen Harry in the '80s. The book's straightforward account of puberty felt radical, and Harry breezed through the whole book in one sitting.\"It was a very frank portrayal of what it was like to be a teenager,\" Harry, who lives in Sydney and is now a young adult author, said during a phone interview.Opinion: Judy Blume is here to save usA few years ago, Harry decided to reread the novel -- this time with her own 11-year-old daughter. Harry was struck by how strong the voice of protagonist Margaret was, and while her daughterwas put offby some plot points around bullying and gender roles, she thought the book was sweet and could relate to Margaret's spiritual uncertainty.Kelly Fremon Craig'sfilm adaptationof \"Are You There, God? It's Me, Margaret\" hits US theatersthis weekend, transporting longtime fans back to their childhoods and introducing a whole new crop of young people to Blume's perceptivecharacters.\"Margaret\" isn't the only Blume title being adapted for our screens. Her adult novel \"Summer Sisters\" is set to become a Hulu limited series, the children's classic \"Superfudge\" is being adapted into an animated film for Disney+ and the young adult novel \"Forever\" is being reimagined for Netflix. Meanwhile, \"Judy Blume Forever,\" a documentary that explores author's life and impact on pop culture, was released last week on Amazon Prime Video.This Judy Blume renaissance is a testament to her enduring popularity. Her frank and straightforward portrayals of young people have captivated the attention of countless readers. Her books have sold more than90 million copies globally. And though a lot has changed for young people in the decades since beloved titles such as \"Margaret,\" \"Tales of a Fourth Grade Nothing\" and \"Tiger Eyes\" first hit shelves, kids and teenagers are still reaching for her books.What set Blume's work apart was the way in which she spoke to the questions and concerns of young people. She pulled no punches when it came to the awkward and uncomfortable. And she signaled to kids that it was okay to have questions, even if grown-ups didn't want them to have the answers.The honesty in her writing was personal -- she knew what it was like to have key information withheld.\"I was an anxious child. I felt adults kept secrets from the kids,\" Blume says in \"Judy Blume Forever.\" \"I hated those secrets.\"Her books laid everything bare. Along with tacklingmenstruation in \"Margaret,\" Blume referenced masturbation in \"Deenie\" and wet dreams in \"Then Again, Maybe I Won't.\" She explored teenagers having sex for the first time in \"Forever.\" But there was more to her books than these titillating tidbits. \"Margaret\" is ultimately about a girl wrestling with her belief in God, while \"Tiger Eyes\" is about a girl coping with the unexpected death of her father.\"She just put it on the page when a lot of people were not,\" Harry said.Judy Blume's straightforward and candid portrayals of young people have captivated generations of readers.The same candor that endeared readers to Blume's writing also made her books targets ofcensorshipandoutrage.Her novels faced frequent challenges and bans through the '80s and '90s, and as recently as March, aFlorida school districtremoved \"Forever\" from shelves.Young people often turned to Blume for information they weren't getting from their parents. Deborah Beckwin, who read many of Blume's novels growing up in Alabama in the '80s and '90s, recalls asking her mother about sex on one occasion and coming away unsatisfied. Her parents were medical professionals and gave hersome information about what it meant to get her period, but the unspoken understanding was that sex was something to be avoided -- something she attributes in part to her evangelical upbringing.Blume's books gave Beckwin the context she was looking for, and shenow considers the author one of her \"literary aunties.\"\"If you're lucky, you'll have the cool auntie who's gonna give you the skinny -- who's gonna give you straight dope about stuff that your parents feel weird to talk about,\" she said. \"I'm sure she was like that for millions of kids.\"Abby Ryder Fortson (left) stars as Margaret in Kelly Fremon Craig's film adaptation of \"Are You There, God? It's Me Margaret.\"V.T. Nayani feels similarly. Nayani, a filmmaker who grew up in Toronto as the daughter of Sri Lankan refugees, said her bodydeveloped earlier than many of her peers, but she didn't feel like she could talk to anyone about it. Blume's novels allowed her to explore some of her questions without judgment -- and helped her understand there was nothing to be ashamed of.\"It's almost like I was in conversation with her characters privately, and I was able to have the conversations that I maybe was embarrassed or afraid to have in my friend circles,\" she said.Thousands of children felt so seen by Blume that they wrote letters to her, asking the author their most burning questions and confiding in her. Often, Blume would write back. Those intimate correspondences, some of which are shared in \"Judy Blume Forever,\" capture just how comfortable so many kids felt opening up to her.\"First of all, how do you know all our little secrets?\" Lorrie Kim, who started writing to Blume at age 9 and is now an author herself, said in one of her letters. \"In reading 'Are You There, God? It's Me, Margaret,' I found that Margaret's problems were very like my own, for my mother is Buddhist and my father Christian. Also, I am not yet growing, and several of my fourth grade classmates wear bras.\"With the endless entertainment options at our fingertips now, it might seem surprising that kids still delight in Blume's stories.Her low-stakes tales about an older sibling exasperated by a rambunctious little brother (\"Tales of A Fourth Grade Nothing\") or an imaginative 10-year-old girl in post-WWII Florida (\"Starring Sally J. Freedman as Herself\") can feel relatively quaint today. But they still resonate,said Lessa Kanani'opua Pelayo-Lozada, president of the American Library Association.Teachers and librarians said Blume's novels continue to resonate with young people today.\"As a children's librarian and as a teen librarian, I've seen the enduring allure and love of Judy Blume,\" she said. \"Those same kinds of experiences that I related to (in 'Tales of a Fourth Grade Nothing') all still ring true with children today, and I think that just speaks to Judy Blume's writing, as well as her understanding of the experience of life.\"Perla Lozoya, a fourth grade teacher in El Paso, Texas, sees this every year when she reads Blume's \"Fudge\" series with her class.Her students \"absolutely love\" the books,which take place in a world not unlike our own. But unexpected events keep readers on their toes -- the characters swallow turtles and get trapped in elevators, and pet birds utter catchphrases like \"bonjour, stupid!\"Blume's vibrant characters and zany scenarios, along with her conversational prose, succeed in engaging even those students who otherwise haven't shown an interest in books, Lozoya said.\"Her books have made a lot of my students fall in love with reading,\" she added.Whether you're a Judy Blume superfan or whether you've never read her books, you've likely felt her influence on pop culture.There are numerous books, TV shows and films today that capture what it's like to be a young person in all its tenderness and uncertainty. It was Blume who blazed the trail, said Davina Pardo, who co-directed the documentary \"Judy Blume Forever,\" in a conversation over Zoom. Blume's characters talked openly about periods and female sexual pleasure, and expressed thoughts both mundane and profound. The way she depicted the interior lives of girls was revolutionary.\"That has led to a whole slew of work by all kinds of creators where the girls' experience matters,\" Pardo said.Lena Dunham, featured in the recent documentary \"Judy Blume Forever,\" is among countless writers who grew up reading Blume.Those creators include YA author Mary H.K. Choi, \"Girls\" creator Lena Dunham and PEN15 co-creator Anna Konkle -- several writers featured in \"Judy Blume Forever\" -- who nod to Blume as an inspiration.Blume also paved the way for writers likeAlex Ginoand Jason Reynolds, who center the experiences of queer and Black children (and whose books face challenges and bans today).Harry, the Sydney-based young adult author, said Blume has also had an enormous influence on her career. Blume's fearlessness in addressing periods inspired Harry to write more openly about menstruation in her novel \"Are You There, Buddha?,\" which is a direct homage to \"Margaret.\" But in Harry's novel, the main character considers newer products likeperiod underwearandmenstrual cupsand begs Buddha for her period to not arrive. Her protagonist is also deeply concerned by climate change, likemany young peopletoday.\"I'm trying to reflect what it is actually like to be a young person in today's society,\" Harry said.Society has changed since Blume's most popular novels were first published -- some of those changes can be seen in newer editions of \"Margaret,\" which reference pads and \"Tampax\" instead ofsanitary belts. But there are some things that haven't changed -- feeling like your parents don't understand you, feeling insecure around your peers, wondering whether your worries are normal.Blume may not have imagined that young people would still be reading her books so many years later. But as Reynolds puts itin \"Judy Blume Forever,\" she didn't have to.\"I think she wrote her books to be timely,\" he said. \"And they were so timely that they became timeless.\"Judy Blume Forever(2023)Davina Pardo and Leah Wolchok offer a look back at Judy Blume's life and career, from her correspondences with young readers to her battles against censorship. At a time when books that addressracialandLGBTQthemes are under attack (and as Blume hasemergedas one of their fiercest defenders), their documentary is timely as ever.Turning Red(2022)Like Judy Blume before her, Domee Shi embraces and celebrates one of life's most awkward phases in this Pixar film about a 13-year-old girl named Mei. \"This movie is actually is for 13-year-old Domee that was in a bathroom, horrified, thinking that she had crapped her pants. And too afraid to tell her mom or ask anybody about what was going on,\" she told Uproxx last year.PEN15(2019)Maya Erskine and Anna Konkle play 13-year-old versions of themselves in this comedy series that takes us right back to middle school. It's an excruciating watch, and we mean that in the best way.\"Brown Girl Dreaming\" by Jacqueline Woodson (2014)This memoir tells the story of Woodson's childhood in South Carolina and New York in the '60s and '70s as she came to terms with the legacy of Jim Crow and the civil rights movement. Written in verse, this moving title won the National Book Award and was a Newbery Honor winner.\"Angus, Thongs and Full-Frontal Snogging\" by Louise Rennison (1999)The first of 10 books in Rennison's \"Confessions of Georgia Nicolson\" series, this young adult novel is written as the diary of a snog-infatuated teenage girl in England, replete with the angst and awkwardness that define adolescence."

        "link": "https://edition.cnn.com/style/article/pretty-yende-king-charles-coronation-spc-intl/index.html",
        "text": "Written by\"Pretty, are you sitting down?\" South African soprano Pretty Yende was performing in Vienna last December when she received a call from her manager. She had just been booked for the biggest gig of her life: a performance at the coronation of King Charles III.On May 6, the world will witness the crowning of Charles III at Westminster Abbey, in London. The 2,000-strong congregation will include royalty and global leaders, and 12 new pieces of music have been commissioned to mark the occasion.As one of three soloists at the ceremony, it's thought that Yende is the first African to be invited to perform solo at a British coronation.CNN speaks with South African singer who will make coronation history\"I was overwhelmed, shocked, happy. All the emotions were just rushing in,\" she said, remembering the invitation.But given the 38-year-old's remarkable journey, it's surprising that she was surprised at all.The story of how Yende reached the pinnacle of her career is an inspirational one. Born in a tiny, rural town formerly known as Piet Retief, now eMkhondo, in Mpumulanga, South Africa, she had a happy, conventional religious upbringing. Her most direct link to music was church hymns.Yende says that as a shy child, she always wanted to please her family. When her grandmother first invited her to sing in public, she knew how uncomfortable it would be to stand in front of people, but she obliged. It became the first step on the road to performing in front of massive audiences.Yende never considered a career in music -- she intended to study accountancy at university. Then she saw opera for the first time on TV at the age of 16. \"Hearing this music and the power of it, sounded like something supernatural. I did not believe human beings could do it,\" she recalled.\"I remember recording it and imitating it,\" she said. \"I would play the recording the whole day. My gosh, my family were in trouble, because I wouldn't stop practicing and shouting.\" Her parents allowed her to study music at university on the condition that she would switch back to an accountancy degree if singing didn't work out.Pretty Yende performs with tenor Andrea Bocelli in Johannesburg, in July 2010.She started making a name for herself in South Africa while still a student at the University of Cape Town, and in 2011, Yende graduated from the Young Artists program at the Accademia at the Teatro alla Scala, in Milan, Italy, and began entering opera competitions.\"The very first opera competition that I did was in Vienna, Austria, where I won everything possible,\" she remembered. \"They called my name so many times I was like, 'No, God please let this one go to someone else.' I felt unworthy ... hearing the kind of finesse that my peers had.\"Her career took off internationally in 2013, with her debut at the Metropolitan Opera House in New York. Yende has since interpreted roles in Puccini's \"La Boh\u00e8me,\" Mozart's \"The Marriage of Figaro\" and Rossini's \"Le comte Ory,\" while performing in major opera houses in Milan, Paris and London.Yende's career has involved a number of firsts, including becoming the \"first Black person to have a new production of 'La Traviata' in Opera Garnier in Paris,\" in a production conceived especially for her, according toan interview with Observer.Pretty Yende at a photo session at the Garnier Opera House, in Paris, in September 2019It has not been all plain sailing. She continues to address the question of opera's Eurocentrism, and hopes to use her fame and talent as an opportunity to break stereotypes.\"The biggest challenge has always been being the different one in the room. When I was the first Black in the Accademia of La Scala it was a bit uncomfortable,\" she remembered.\"Sometimes I would enter the rehearsal room, and I could see in the room looks like, 'Why are you here?' And I would just smile. But once I start making music, all of us in that room agreed that I'm not there by mistake.\"Opera has featured strongly in the life of King Charles, who is a patron of over a dozen musical organizations. In 1981, when the then-prince married the late Princess Diana, Kiri Te Kanawa, an opera singer from New Zealand,  performed at the wedding. On May 6, the program will also feature performances from bass-baritone Bryn Terfel and baritone Roderick Williams.The coronation will not be the first time King Charles has watched Yende perform; he saw the soprano sing at the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra's 75th anniversary gala, held at Windsor Castle in April 2022.Nevertheless, the invite to the coronation is a rare honor. \"It's historic, it's generational,\" Yende said.She will perform \"Sacred Fire,\" a new work by classical and film composer Sarah Class that Buckingham Palace has said \"evokes a bridge between the angelic and human realms\" with its imagery from the Bible.\"It's a vision of the freedom and protection of all beings, and of the abundance and beauty of our natural world,\" said Class in a statement.Pretty Yende performs in \"Lucia Di Lammermoor\" at the Bastille Opera House in Paris in October 2016.Over 26 million Britons watched Queen Elizabeth II's funeral andmore than 20 million people in the UKtuned in to watch her coronation in 1953, according to the BBC.For the new King this is a defining moment: a historic spectacle, but also an opportunity to reinforce the Crown's relationship with the British people and the Commonwealth.There has been opposition from some who argue that someone from one of Britain's former colonies should not be singing at the coronation, but Yende is unperturbed.\"My gift is a place where ... people from all walks of life are able to find a place of healing, and reconciliation to move forward into the future,\" she said.There will be many millions watching the coronation from around the world, including Yende's family in Mpumalanga. It will be a historic moment for the continent, but most importantly it will be a cherished occasion for the singer who so nearly became an accountant.\"I have feelings of excitement and joy for this upcoming engagement, just like any other,\" she says. \"I'm preparing and really looking forward to it.\""

        "name": "The US has a rich drag history. Here's why the art form will likely outlast attempts to restrict it",
        "link": "https://edition.cnn.com/style/article/drag-queen-us-history-explainer-cec/index.html",
        "text": "Written byTo many, the stereotypical image of a drag queen is one of a gay man dressed in exaggerated feminine getup, oversized wigs and heavy makeup. But drag's image -- and history -- is far more complex.Drag is a grand dame in a glittering gown, commanding the stage with a power ballad or disco classic. Drag is also anunderground performertwirling onstage to Madonna's \"Papa Don't Preach.\"It's the glitzy cast of \"RuPaul's Drag Race: All Stars\" and small-town performers with dedicated local followings. It's a queen namedMeatballdressed as aghoulish\u202fexaggeration\u202fof George Santos, singing the \"Greatest Showman\" anthem \"This is Me,\" and a king namedMo B. Dickin a firetruck-red pompadour and drawn-on goatee. It's cisgender and trans men, trans and cis women and nonbinary people. Its performers are gay and straight. It's masculine and feminine; it's neither or both.\"Drag is the theatrical exaggeration of gender,\" said Joe E. Jeffreys, a drag historian and adjunct instructor at New York University, who noted that the artform constantly subverts \"what people think they know about gender.\"At its core, drag is an art form that for over a century has affirmed and uplifted LGBTQ people who perform and enjoy it. But this year in particular, some US states have attempted to imposelegislative measuresthat would impact where and when drag can be performed. In Tennessee, where themost restrictive measuresto date werepassed in March, people who perform in drag in an area where children could see them could be charged with a misdemeanor or felony. (The ban wastemporarily blockedhours before it was expected to be implemented.)Attendees enjoy New York's Wigstock festival in 1994.Drag has become increasingly visible in recent years through mainstream shows like \"RuPaul's Drag Race\" and popular public events such as drag brunches, drag bingo and drag queen story hours, in which drag performers read children's books to young audiences, often at libraries. Outside of the impact recent legislative measures will have on drag performers, many fear that trans people could also be wrongly criminalized for expressing their gender in public. And all of these bills are being introduced amid a wider campaign in many states toroll back the rightsof queer and trans people.Drag probes and questions gender and social norms, provoking audiences to do the same -- and that is \"inherently political,\" Jeffreys said.LGBTQ historians and performers say drag will endure in spite of any fearmongering and hate. Survival, they say, is baked into the art form's long, defiant legacy.Drag is likely as old as gender norms -- it's a \"part of the human condition,\" said Larry La Fountain-Stokes, a professor of Spanish, American culture\u202fand women's and gender studies at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor who also performs in drag under the name Lola von Miramar.\"As long as people have been using clothes or marking gender in different ways, you've had people transgressing and challenging those conventions,\" he\u202fsaid in a phone interview.New York's Harlem neighborhood is thought by many to be thebirthplace of drag ballsin the 1860s. There, Black queer and trans residents donned dresses and wigs to perform in a safe, creative environment. (One theory about the origin of the term \"drag\" is that it referenced the way gowns \"dragged\" across the floor; another is that it derived fromPolari, a slang-y language used frequently by queer British men, Jeffreys said.)One of the first known people to call themselves a \"queen of drag\" was William Dorsey Swann. A formerly enslaved man, Swann in 1882 began hosting guests, many of them former slaves, for drag dances at his Washington,\u202fDC home.When Swann confronted police in a cream satin gown after they raided one of his parties in 1888, he was arrested and charged with \"being a suspicious character.\" He was arrested several more times throughout his life after protecting queer friends during raids, according toChanning Gerard Joseph, an LGBTQ historian and Princeton University instructor who has said he's the first academic to highlight Swann's contributions to drag history.Swann's drag dances and subsequent arrests were some of the first recorded acts of resistance in the burgeoning queer liberation movement in America, in which drag has played an essential role for more than 100 years, said Nino Testa, an associate professor of professional practice in women and gender studies at Texas Christian University in Fort Worth.\"The pleasure was the resistance,\" Testa said in a phone interview. \"The celebration of queer joy when it's been denied in all these other spaces is activism.\"Julian Eltinge (right) performing in drag in 1917.Drag performers were often stars of the vaudeville scene of the early 20th century, Jeffreys said. \"Female impersonator\"Julian Eltingewas a particularly popular performer who published a magazine and launched his own makeup line, Jeffreys said. Those who perform exaggerated forms of masculinity, now often referred to asdrag kings,also commanded stages across the US, proving masculinity could be prodded as much as femininity.The term \"homosexuality\" came into greater circulation in the '30s, Jeffreys said, as did\"pansy acts\"-- hyper-feminine queens whose routines included innuendos about same-sex desire. And even though the '50s were a\"dark period\"for queer and trans people, Jeffreys said, some drag acts like theJewel Box Revuefound national success and catered to mainstream audiences.Even after the counterculture movement took over the '60s and sizable LGBTQ communities were forming in major cities, dressing in drag in public could still be dangerous. Police regularly raided gay bars in the US -- until the late '60s, Jeffreys said, it was illegal for bars in New York to serve a drink to a \"known homosexual.\"Despite the pervasive danger of living authentically, drag performers in this era also experimented with the traditional drag format. Queens founded their own drag houses -- and chosen families in the process; for many Black and Latino queer and trans people this was a reaction to the racism they faced within the gay pageant scene. This was also the era when lip syncing became the norm, Jeffreys said, and drag became less binary -- \"genderf**k\" drag was used to describe some performers who weren't easily defined as masculine or feminine.Offstage, many\u202fqueens led collective efforts to aid queer and trans people. When the AIDS crisis worsened in the '80s, groups like theSisters of Perpetual Indulgencein San Francisco raised money to house AIDS patients and pay for their health\u202fcare. Others gladly\u202fhosted events or lent their talents to fundraising efforts.Joan Jett Blakk, pictured during her San Francisco mayoral run in 1999, ran for US president in 1992.\"We had to get out on the street and save our own lives,\" said Joan Jett Blakk, a drag queen who ran forUS presidentin 1992.Blakk, then an advocate with AIDS grassroots organization Act Up and political group Queer Nation, never ran to win -- she wanted to do \"something different with drag and tie activism in,\" she said in a phone conversation.\"It's great to think that you made a little dent in history,\" Blakk said. \"But I'm surprised we have to get back out in the streets again and keep going.\"Trans drag performers have played a key role throughout the history of the art form -- \"you can't tell the story of drag without trans people,\" Testa said.As drag grew in popularity in the '60s and beyond, many trans women found themselves performing because rampant transphobia and homophobia made it difficult to find other work. Drag was often a form of financial survival, said Testa.Devin Antheus, who coauthored the photo book\"Legends of Drag\"with Harry James Hanson, said many of the queens he and Hanson photographed and interviewed began performing in the '60s and '70s, before terms like \"trans\" came into popular use.Marsha P. Johnson, pictured in 1982, was an influential figure in the queer liberation movement.Sylvia Rivera andMarsha P. Johnson, two trans women of color best known for participating in the1969 Stonewall protests, used several terms to describe themselves throughout their lives, whether it was drag queen, \"transvestite,\" which then wasn't widely considered a slur and was more commonly used than \"transgender,\" ortrans, La Fountain-Stokes said.\"People of our generation and after grew up in a realm where identity categories are very important and delineated,\" Antheus said over the phone. \"And for a lot of the girls, both queens who currently now identify as trans and those who don't, back in the day, there weren't such precise divisions when people were in internal spaces ... they all rolled together.\"And yet, even within the LGBTQ community, trans women who performed in drag were often ostracized, particularly among some cisgender gay drag queens, according to Esther Newton, an anthropologist who authored the seminal 1979 book \"Mother Camp\" about Midwestern drag queens.Some trans drag queens who received hormone injections were \"strongly deplored by stage impersonators who (said) that the whole point of female impersonation depends on maleness,\" Newton wrote.That sentiment has not entirely disappeared. In 2018, RuPaul Charles, one of the world's best-known drag queens and host of the Emmy-winning reality series \"RuPaul's Drag Race\" franchise,saidthat he would \"probably not\" allow trans women who'd undergone gender-affirming procedures to compete on the series. (Despite this, several contestants had already come out as trans while appearing on the show or after their season aired, like Monica Beverly Hillz, Kylie Sonique Love and Peppermint.)\"Drag loses its sense of danger and its sense of irony once it's not men doing it, because at its core it's a social statement and a big f-you to male-dominated culture,\" RuPaul said \u202fin an interview with The Guardian, \u202fpositioning the \"trans movement\" and the \"drag movement\" as two dichotomous groups.Sasha Colby, pictured onstage in 2022, won the 15th season of \"RuPaul's Drag Race\" and is one of the franchise's first out trans winners.RuPaul laterwalked back his comments, and the series has seen several trans contestants since, including Season 15 winnerSasha Colby. Many \"Drag Race\" cast members have graduated toappearanceson Broadway,sold-outtours and recording careers. But \"Drag Race\" has also skewed viewers' definition of drag -- no drag kings have ever competed on the series, Testa noted, and the judges have long imposed somewhat traditional beauty standards upon contestants.Drag's growing popularity hasn't come without challenges.Whilerecent legislative attackslike Tennessee's restrictions on public drag performances took some LGBTQ researchers and performers by surprise, Jeffreys said they shouldn't be shocked.\"As soon as anything gets that level of visibility, there's going to be pushback,\" he noted.Drag performers and scholars said they believe drag is being scapegoated as a distraction from serious issues in the US, including gun violence, poverty and institutional racism, all of which disproportionately impact LGBTQ people, particularly Black trans women.Pickle reads from a book during the Drag Queen Story Hour program at a Los Angeles library in 2019.And asbills aim to limit dragperformances in public, advocates fear how they might affect trans people who are not drag performers. Antheus said that if police interpret the law to apply to trans people wearing gender-affirming dress in public, they could potentially criminalize trans people's very existence. Therights of trans peoplehave already come under attack in more than half of US states, many of which have introduced bills that would restrict trans young people from receiving gender-affirming health care or from participating in a sport that matches their gender.There's no evidence thatexposure to drag\"harms\" children, as many conservative lawmakers and drag ban supporters claim, Testa said. These lawmakers falsely claim that drag performers \"groom\" or sexualize children,of which there isalso no evidence. Drag acts containing sexual innuendos and adult themes take place in age-restricted bars or at events children aren't allowed to attend or that require parental consent.What dragdo is expose people of all ages to alternative ways ofthinking about gender and sexuality, La Fountain-Stokes said, and encourages spectators to consider their own identities more critically.\"Queer people have always found creative ways to resist the violence of their experience and norms that have tried to restrict our ability to live freely in the world,\" Testa said. \"Drag is a process of that resistance. These communities formed as a response to harassment, exclusion and violence. I'm hopeful in the sense that we've done this before -- we never stopped doing it.\"Drag has survived for as long as it has because it's always been a vessel for expression for queer and trans people who've had to carve their own paths. It's why Alaska Thunderf**k, the blonde bouffanted winner of the second season of \"RuPaul's Drag Race All Stars,\" first got into drag -- to make art that wasn't bound by rules. That, she said in an email, and to have pure, unadulterated fun.\"The great thing about drag is that the second you think you've got it figured out, it changes and turns into something else,\" Alaska wrote. \"That's why we'll always survive.\""

I realized that was very important to me.\"Project 562 is staggering in its scope, representing the Miccosukee Tribe in the Everglades all the way to the Siberian Yupik people far off the Alaska coast.The portraits \u2014 from elders and teens to multiple generations posing together \u2014 have a sense of intimacy and warmth, with each image accompanied by her collaborators' own accounts of their lived experiences.Through its interviews, the project delves deeply into kinship and love, displacement and reconnection, the generational impacts of colonialism and racism, environmental justice and activism, and inclusion and belonging.Matika's mother, Nancy, and daughter, Alma Bee.As time went on, Wilbur felt deeply changed by the work, gaining a greater understanding of herself in relation to the land on which she was raised.\"We do have these systemic ways of developing our children to have relationships with the place that they come from, and to... teach them to become stewards,\" Wilbur said. \"As I started traveling, I started to put together and realize the different ways that these different communities do that. For me, it felt intrinsic, because I grew up fishing, I grew up on canoes, I grew up going to the longhouse, I grew up going to ceremony. And all of these things made me a person of the tide, but I wouldn't have told you 10 years ago, that that was how I identify.\"And the more she traveled, the more she understood how \"site-specific\" her identity was, Wilbur explained. \"I would meet the people of the blue-green waters and the people of the tall pine trees or the people that live within the four sacred mountains, and I would get to go to ceremonies and witness cultural protocol that made their communities deeply, intrinsically, inextricably connected to the land that they come from. That was profound for me.\"Below are some portraits featured in \"Project 562,\" and the stories behind them.Dr. Henrietta Mann has been an educator for more than five decades, architecting Native American studies programs for multiple universities. She was recently honored with a National Humanities Medal by President Biden and appears on the cover of \"Project 562.\"Dr. Henrietta Mann\"I wanted to have a matriarch on the cover,\" Wilbur told CNN. \"I really have thought a lot about rematriation (restoring sacred principles), and the work of rematriation and how important it is to uplift our women who have worked for decades, like Auntie Dr. Henrietta Mann who dedicated her life to the betterment of Indigenous people.\"Hannah Tomeo is an athlete and a Northwest Indian Youth Conference Princess. Wilbur photographed her in the Methow Valley outside of the multiday conference, which is hosted by a different tribe in the region each year. At the 2016-2017 event, Tomeo and Wilbur were both keynote speakers.Hannah Tomeo\"Running has been my absolute passion and my stability, but I felt as if no one wanted me to succeed in high school,\" Tomeo told Wilbur for \"Project 562.\"\"My teacher told me it was in my genetics to be an alcoholic; my basketball coach would drug test only me on the team; my track coach told me I would just be another stupid Indian runner with no chance in the real running world. I let those words motivate and push me until I earned the fastest times in the school, but they still wouldn't let me race.\" Tomeo was replaced in races with no explanation until she finally quit, she explained. \"My spirit had officially been broken. I never thought I would run again. Then my dad gave me these words: 'You can either be a quitter or come back a success story. Your choice.'\"\"That summer I trained harder than ever and came back strong. I made it to State. I made first team and placed in the Nike meet in Boise and at Footlocker in California... My story isn't over.\"Darkfeather Ancheta (left) and her sister Bibiana have become \"like sisters\" to Wilbur, she noted in the book. Here they are pictured with Bibiana's son, Eckos.Darkfeather, Eckos and Bibiana Ancheta\"I had a dream about them standing there like (in the photograph) in front of Tulalip Bay,\" Wilbur told CNN. \"So I called them and asked them if I could take their photo in the way that I'd seen in my dream.\"\"Our communities still have these kinship systems and these familial ties where an auntie is like a second mom. She is the protector and equally invested in the growing of the child... I wanted to try to create an image with this image that really showed and encapsulated, you know, the way that we take care of our babies, the way we love our babies.\"Joshua Mori is a farmer, teacher and founder of community, wellness and agriculture nonprofit Iwikua in Kaua\u02bbi, Hawaii. Wilbur photographed him with one of his three children on his aquaponic farm, a method for water-based farming that uses fish as a natural fertilizer.Joshua Dean Iokua Ikaikaloa Mori\"My work is about wanting to take back the food system and really attack colonialism at the source,\" Mori told Wilbur for \"Project 562.\" \"At our root source, our diet, which affects everything in our bodies \u2014 how we feel, how we think, how we love, how we procreate. Food, in my opinion, affects all of that. So we're doing aquaponic farming, which is just taking a traditional model of a food system and just shrinking it down to modern technology. We take our traditional Native knowledge and integrate it with modern technology to make it more accessible.\"\"The kids learn when they come out here traditional hale building (house building), traditional farming, working in kalo patches, and also modern farming techniques,\" he added. \"They learn how to spearfish and fish traditionally. Also, star navigation. How to use all of the tools, really, how Hawaiians became Hawaiians.\"Drew Michael is a traditional Yup'ik mask-maker and identifies as Two Spirit, or having both masculine and feminine spirits. Michael and his twin brother were adopted and raised by non-Native parents in Alaska and spoke with Wilbur about reconnecting to his Indigenous identity. Wilbur photographed him in his home.Drew Michael\"Growing up, I did not have a good sense of my culture or identity as a Yup'ik and I\u00f1upiaq man... I did not have access to that until I took a carving class with my father,\" Michael told Wilbur in \"Project 562\". \"I was able to create my own piece, my own representation, almost a copy of a mask in a book from an exhibition. That was the first time that I was introduced to my culture, and I felt like I was starting to own it a little bit. As I learned more about masks, why they were used, who used them, and then the ceremonies and rituals, I started to see and learn about myself through the masks.\"\"I know especially in Yup'ik culture, people were Two-Spirited, and typically they would be healers because they could see into both worlds, the masculine and feminine, and can almost hold hands with both... so, since I am Two-Spirited, and I also do masks and other forms, I try to talk about different healing within my work.\"The Mitchells have been married for more than six decades. Robert, a former railroad worker, now raises livestock on their land. The couple prefer to speak in Navajo, so their daughter-in-law translated for Wilbur. Wilbur spent her 30th birthday with them, and was treated to dinner, cake and gifts in their home.Fannie and Robert Mitchell\"There's not a lot of Native people that you meet anymore that just speak their language. And so for me, it was a profound experience, to be in a home where they're still living very traditionally, and taking care of sheep, and speaking their language,\" Wilbur told CNN.\"In my time on the road, I approached it in really the only way that I know how \u2014 which is as a Native person. You don't show up empty-handed, you bring food, you stay a while. You leave traditional gifts behind, you stay in touch with folks, and so I felt really fortunate to get to meet these folks and to get to be in their home for a little while.\"Out of frame, she said, there was a touch of chaos taking place. \"There's a drawn-back version of this portrait, where there's a sheep licking me as I'm taking this photo and there's two horses trying to eat my light... and that's why they're laughing.\"John Sneezy, who identified as Two Spirit, was a Grass Dancer at powwows for more than three decades, but was not able to perform in the Traditional Cloth category \u2014 which Wilbur notes is danced by women \u2014 until 2016, when he participated in the Bay Area American Indian Two-Spirit Powwow (BAAITS). Wilbur photographed him in San Francisco. He died before the book published.John Sneezy\"Our young Two Spirit people in Indian Country experience a lot of violence for their identity. John would say, 'I dance, and I wear women's regalia, and I want to be shown in your book like this,'\" Wilbur recalled to CNN. \"John called me and told me that it was really important to him that we continue to uplift stories about Two Spirit people, so that our young Two Spirit relatives feel safe and seen and heard.\"\"John had spent his whole life wanting to dance in a woman's Apache dress, but didn't feel safe to do so until he traveled to the Bay Area American Indian Two-Spirit Powwow, which I think says a lot about the way that members of the LGBTQ+ community are treated in some of our communities. It's really important in national conversations about Indigenous identity that we make sure to acknowledge our Two Spirit relatives and create space for representation. And John would want me to share that with you.\""

        "link": "https://edition.cnn.com/style/article/playboy-the-conversation/index.html",
        "text": "In partnership withWritten byThe views expressed in this commentary are solely those of the writers. CNN is showcasing the work ofThe Conversation, a collaboration between journalists and academics to provide news analysis and commentary. The content is produced solely by The Conversation.Hugh Hefner launched Playboy Magazine 70 years ago this year. The first issue included a nude photograph of Marilyn Monroe, which he had purchased and published without her knowledge or consent.Hefner went on to build the Playboy brand off the backs of the countless women featured in its pages, whose beauty and performance of heightened feminine sexuality have entertained its readers for generations.Approaching its 70th anniversary in December, Playboy has radically shifted. With the magazine no longer in publication, the Playboy Mansion sold to a developer and London's last remaining Playboy Club closing in 2021, what is the future for Playboy? The brand is changing to keep up with the post-#MeToo world.Hefner passed away one month before allegations against film producer Harvey Weinstein surfaced in 2017 giving momentum to the #MeToo movement (which saw survivors of sexual assault and harassment speak out against their abusers).In recent years,many have re-evaluatedHefner's legacy and relationships with women. The 2022 docuseries \"The Secrets of Playboy\" (which aired on Channel 4 in the UK) detailed sexual misconduct accusations against Hefner from several ex-girlfriends, including model Sondra Theodore and TV personality Holly Madison.Hugh Hefner and Pamela Anderson during Playboy's 50th Anniversary Celebration at New York Armory in New York City.Hefner and Playboy's relationship with women has been complicated. Playboy was anearly supporterof abortion rights,helped fundthe first rape kit and was at times anearly proponentof inclusivity (for example featuring transgender model, Caroline \"Tula\" Cossey, in its June 1981 issue). But most women featured in Playboy have fit within a narrow beauty standard \u2014 thin, white, able-bodied and blonde.Meanwhile Hefner's personal relationship with his much younger girlfriends reportedlyfollowed patternsof control and emotional abuse. Ex-girlfriend Holly Madison described Hefner as treating her \"like a glorified pet\" in her 2015 memoir, \"Down the Rabbit Hole.\"Hefner's passing meant he evaded reckoning with the #MeToo movement. Playboy, however, responded, releasing astatementin which it affirmed support for the women featured in \"The Secrets of Playboy\" and called Hefner's actions \"abhorrent.\"The statement declared that the brand was no longer affiliated with the Hefner family and would be focusing on aspects of the company's legacy that align with values of sex positivity and free expression.Today, Playboy is a very different company from the one Hefner launched nearly 70 years ago. Roughly 80% of Playboy staff identify as women, according the company, and its motto has changed from \"Entertainment for Men\" to \"Pleasure for All.\" Shares in the company are publicly traded and 40% of its board and management are women.The company has also moved towards more creator-led content through its app, Playboy Centerfold. Similar to subscription content service OnlyFans, Playboy Centerfold allows subscribers to view content from and interact with its creators, which it call \"bunnies.\"Playboy \"bunnies\" in the West Indies, 1965.On the app, creators \u2014 or bunnies \u2014 are able portray their own bodies however they wish, putting the power back in their hands. Perhaps Playboy's future is no longer in serving the male gaze, but instead the very audience Hefner dismissed in hisfirst letter from the editor:\"If you're a man between the ages of 18 and 80 Playboy is meant for you ... If you're somebody's sister, wife or mother-in-law and picked us up by mistake, please pass us along to the man in your life and get back to your Ladies Home Companion.\"The stars of Playboy's mid-2000s reality series, Holly Madison and Bridget Marquardt, are also enjoying a resurgence among fans.\"The Girls Next Door\" launched in 2004. The show focused on the lives of Hefner's three girlfriends, Madison, Marquardt and Kendra Wilkinson. It became E's best performing show and cultivated a new female audience for Playboy.\"The Girls Next Door\" was a story of complicated empowerment despite patriarchal interference. Its three female protagonists went from being known solely as some of Hefner's many blonde girlfriends, to celebrities in their own right.They each ultimately broke up with Hefner, leaving the Mansion and going on to lead successful careers.The show's depiction of Madison, Marquardt and Wilkinson as empowered, fun-loving and complex individuals, who found joy and agency through expressing their sexuality was perhaps what drew so many female fans to the show. However, amid the girls' fight for agency, Hefner retaliated.Bridget Marquardt and Hugh Hefner with Holly Madison and Kendra Wilkinson in 2008.The series shows that he maintained final say in every Playboy photograph of the girls, as well as imposing strict curfews and spending allowances.In Madison and Wilkinson's memoirs, \"Down the Rabbit Hole,\" and \"Sliding into Home,\" they claim that production consistently undermined them. They refused to pay them for the first season, didn't credit them until season four and aired their uncensored nude bodies in foreign broadcasts and DVD releases without consent.Fan interest in \"The Girls Next Door\" remains strong. In August 2022 Madison and Marquardt launched their podcast \"Girls Next Level,\" where they interview previous playmates and interact with fans. They also recap episodes from their own points of view, unpacking their experiences of working on the show.Having reached 10 million downloads as of February 2023, the success of the podcast \u2014 14 years after the last episode of \"The Girls Next Door\" \u2014 speaks to the cultural legacy of the Playboy brand. It also shows that despite Hefner's original editor's note, Playboy resonates with some women.Playboy is now in a post-Hefner era, where the imagery of women found within old issues of Playboy can serve as inspiration for others to enjoy their own sexuality. Whatever the future has for the company, the concept of Playboy has become public property \u2014 be that in the appearance of Playboy bunny costumes each Halloween, the popularity of cheeky Playboy logo tattoos or branded lingerie and clothing.In a post-#MeToo era, the women of Playboy are speaking up and taking over. With the mansion gates closed, the bunnies are finally reclaiming the brand as their own.Daisy McManaman is a PhD Candidate at the Centre for Women's Studies, University of York.

        "name": "How this photographer makes sublime landscapes of the American West",
        "link": "https://edition.cnn.com/style/article/reuben-wu-landscape-photography/index.html",
        "text": "Written byThe first time Reuben Wu saw the warm sandstone hues and vast, open skies of the American West, he was watching the landscapes pass him by from the window of a tour bus.The British visual artist, now based in Chicago, has become known for his sublime imagery of remote landscapes using drone lighting, enhancing craggy peaks with halos, or writing glyphs in the sky like signals from a supernatural entity. But for a long time, art was just a passion project while he focused on a music career as one of the four members of the synth-pop band Ladytron.\"(Photography) started as an all-consuming hobby,\" he explained in a phone interview. But when Ladytron took a break in 2011 after five studio albums (they released a self-titled sixth album in 2019, and the seventh, \"Time's Arrow,\" this month), he began a new career from scratch. \"While the others did their own solo projects, making their own music and releasing their own albums, this was my solo project.\"Wu's imagery takes a classic photographer's combination \u2014 light and landscape \u2014 and marries the two in transformative ways. He often begins with dusky evening light or the ink-black shadows of night, then strategically illuminates portions of the scene with custom-built consumer drones. In one image, a bright horizontal line hangs over a glacier in the Peruvian Andes, revealing the brilliance of the ice against a dark sky. In a different motion piece, Wu simulated an electrical storm in Goblin Valley, Utah, but with perfectly straight strikes of light rather than the jagged bursts of lightning.The artist's 2018 photo book \"Lux Noctis\" is in the collections of the Guggenheim and Museum of Modern Art, in New York, and he has shot commercial work for Apple, Audi and Google as well as the DJ and music producer Zedd. Last summer, Wu revealed a colossal project for National Geographic: a cover story and timelapse multimedia piece about Stonehenge, which featured the enigmatic monument lit by his custom drones. In November, one of his NFTs, a 4K video loop titled \"An Irresistible Force,\" outperformed its high estimate by over 25% during an auction at Sotheby's Hong Kong, selling at 441,000 HKD (about $56,500).\"I couldn't have dreamed of where I am now,\" Wu said. \"I just wanted to be able to make a living from doing art and from doing photography.\"Wu has always been drawn to wild, remote places where he could find solitude. His parents immigrated from Hong Kong to the UK before he was born, and he grew up an introverted child in Liverpool, he said, who didn't quite click with school. He was fascinated with science-fiction films that mix the alien with the everyday, such as Steven Spielberg's \"Close Encounters of the Third Kind,\" which featured Wyoming's Devils Tower as a site for extraterrestrial contact. (Unfamiliar with American topography, he initially thought the butte, a national monument, was a fictional geological entity, he explained with a laugh).The film's visuals of remote desert scenes mixed with eerie lights have been a formative inspiration in his own work. \"(It's) cemented into my brain, the idea of these seemingly impossible lights moving through the sky, kind of like search lights on very ordinary (American) landscapes,\" he said.Reuben Wu has traveled extensively to remote places in the US and beyond for his work. Here, he traveled to Bolivia's salt flats, using the vast, empty land as his canvas.He embarked on his first cross-country photography trip across the US in 2013, around a decade after getting a taste on the road with Ladytron. The resulting series featured vivid depictions of the Grand Canyon and South Dakota Badlands, as well as a time-lapse image of Devils Tower at night among star trails.Two years later, Wu discovered the effect that drone lighting could have on the natural world while working on an outdoor automotive shoot.\"I flew the drone up above some cliffs, and I was absolutely fascinated by the effect it had on the actual landscape,\" he explained. It made the cliffs glow, reaching areas that were otherwise impossible to light artificially.Wu's earliest inspiration came from \"Close Encounters of the Third Kind,\" inspiring his interest in the American West.Wu rigs lights on drones to suit his needs on any given shoot or project. The first iteration, he said, which he used when the technology was still nascent, was a \"massive\" eight-rotor drone outfitted with homemade lights that only had about eight minutes of flight time. The next used a 3D-printed bracket with an LED hot light, but still only gave him an additional two minutes in the air. The tech he uses now gives him a bit more breathing room, with a half hour to fly out, capture images and return to him, but he's had to learn to work within the bounds of each set-up.\"I'm a lot less anxious now, because I've crashed a number of drones,\" he said. \"And in the end, they're just tools.\"After developing series of still images such as \"Lux Noctis\" and \"Aeroglyphs,\" which experiment with ghostly lighting and geometric shapes in the skies, Wu found himself wanting to incorporate motion and sound into his work because of his own background in music. He began creating 15-second video loops from his images, showing light beams forming patterns or the moon arcing across the sky, to the beats of atmospheric electronic music that he produced.\"These (works) were very much experimental and had no end goal \u2014 they were just things that I did for love out of love,\" he said. \"I couldn't license them, I couldn't print them... and so they were just there, stacking likes on my Instagram.\"Wu has been commissioned to shoot in various locations, including the New Mexico badlands. This image came from a 20-hour shoot.But in January 2021, Wu found a way to make them a more substantial part of his career when he was introduced to NFT art. He minted his first \"non-fungible token\"  on the marketplace Foundation two months later \u2014 an \"aeroglyph\" of bright lines forming a rectangle above a beachside cliff. It sold for 30 ETH ($45,000), a portion of which he donated to the National Parks Conservation Association and the AAPI Community Fund. Later that year, the web3 arts organization Obscura commissioned him to produce a new set of images titled \"Aeroglyph Variations,\" which took him into the New Mexico badlands for a 20-hour shoot that resulted in 55 images of the same setting, each with different lighting conditions and patterns. Wu has also experimented with presenting the work in different ways, from animations, to AR experiences, to projection mapping moving images onto physical prints.\"It's very much a hybrid medium, and so I'd like to expand that horizon even more, and think about the end goal for my work,\" he said. \"Am I creating a nice piece of art for people to look at and appreciate, or am I creating an experience for people to share?\"Wu is leaning towards the latter as he continues to experiment with the form his work takes, but no matter the medium, his vision of and approach to the natural world remains consistent.\"A lot of people always say that my work is otherworldly \u2014 that is the first word that people think of when they think about my work,\" he said. \"But I'm not trying to create an alien-looking image; I'm trying to show that this is our planet. And there are so many new ways that are available to see it that can renew your perspective.\""

        "text": "Written byFor some \u2014 the chance to see a banana duct-taped to a wall is to be within touching distance of a sensational moment in recent art history. For others, it's an enticing snack.On Thursday, an art student from Seoul National University found it to be the latter, when he removed the fruit \u2014 an iconic work by Italian artist Maurizio Cattelan \u2014 from off a wall at the Leeum Museum of Art in Seoul, South Korea where it was displayed. Then he proceeded to devour it.\"The student told the museum he ate it because he was hungry,\" a museum spokesperson told CNN in a phone call.Entitled \"Comedian,\" the work became one of the art world's biggest viral moments when it sold for $120,000 at Art Basel Miami Beach in December 2019. Two other editions of the piece also sold at the fair.After chomping down the fruit, the student taped the peel back on to the wall. The peel was later replaced by the museum with a fresh banana.The aftermath of the incident.\"It happened suddenly, so no special action was taken. The artist (Cattelan) was informed of the incident but he didn't have any reaction to it,\" the museum spokesperson added.The work is part of Cattelan's solo exhibition WE that iscurrently running at the Seoul-based museum until July 16. The banana itself is regularly swapped out every two to three days,and is not for sale.Cattelan is known for satiricalpieces that challenge popular culture, often provoking debates around conceptual art.\"Comedian\" by Italian artist Maurizio Cattelan,  is on display in Leeum Museum of Art until July 16 in Seoul, South KoreaThis wasn't the first time someone thought the artwork was ripe for picking.After the first edition of \"Comedian\"sold back in 2019, performance artist David Datuna unceremoniously plucked the banana on display at the Perrotin gallery at Art Basel in Miami and gobbled it up as stunned onlookers watched.Datuna relished in the stunt,postingto Instagram at the time saying \"I really love this installation. It's very delicious.\" Later hedefendedthe act, calling it an art performance at a press conference and not an act of vandalism.Prior to the headline-making sale of artwork, Perrotin told CNN the bananas are \"a symbol of global trade, a double entendre, as well as a classic device for humor,\" adding that Cattelan turns mundane objects into \"vehicles of both delight and critique.\" Theartist did not provide potential buyers with instructions on what to do when the artwork starts to decompose.Someone ate a $120,000 banana that an artist had taped to a wallThe artwork is also embroiled in acopyright battle. In 2022, Joe Morford, an artist from Glendale, California, allegedthat Cattelan plagiarized his own 2000 artwork titled \"Banana & Orange\" \u2014 which sees the titular fruits affixed with duct tape onto painted green backgrounds on a wall.According to court documents, Morford, who is representing himself, had registered the artwork with the US Copyright Office and posted the work on his website, Facebook and YouTube accounts long before Cattelan created \"Comedian.\"Cattelan's lawyers have argued that Morford has \"no valid copyright,\" to the elements of the artwork \u2014 the banana and the duct tape stuck against a wall.Another one of Cattelan's viral artworks was asolid 18-carat-gold toilet\"entitled\" America, valued at around $6 million. It had been first installed at New York's Guggenheim in 2016 and was open to use by visitors.Later in 2019, it was stolen from the birthplace of Winston Churchill at Bleinheim Palace in England where it was being exhibited. It has never been found.CNN's Rob Picheta and Jacqui Palumbo contributed to this report."

        "link": "https://edition.cnn.com/travel/article/shark-attack-how-to-survive/index.html",
        "text": "First things first: Despite some truly terrifying tales of survival, you are incredibly unlikely to be duking it out with a shark any time soon.But sharks do occasionally attack humans.Florida teen Addison Bethea was severely injured in the summer of 2022in the waters off Keaton Beach along Florida\u2019s Gulf Coast. Aafter a woman suffered a shark bite off Southern California\u2019s famed Del Mar Beach in November 2022. And in Hawaii,but was able to swim to a catamaran for help in March 2023.While these kinds of encounter understandably strike fear into would-be ocean swimmers, there\u2019s no need to panic about your upcoming beach vacation. The chances of being attacked by a shark are extremely low.The Florida Museum of Natural History\u2019sfound only 73 confirmed, unprovoked shark bites on people and 39 confirmed, provoked bites in 2021 worldwide.Think about it a minute \u2013 theis nearing 8 billion people. Many of those live near or vacation at the coast. And only 112 bites were logged. Yourare much, much higher.In 2021, the United States led the way in unprovoked attacks at 47; Florida had the highest state total at 28.That said, you can take steps to increase your chances of survival during a highly improbable attack, according to shark experts interviewed by CNN Travel.Sharks are salt-water creatures. The ocean is their home; we are the visitors.\u201cIf you\u2019re going to the ocean, you have to assume you could encounter a shark regardless of when or where that is,\u201d said Neil Hammerschlag, director of the Shark Research and Conservation Program at the University of Miami Rosenstiel School.Sharks grab our attention, but there are far more dangerous things\u201cFortunately, humans aren\u2019t on the menu, and also fortunately, sharks tend to avoid people.\u201dStill, there are places you\u2019re more likely to encounter a shark.You should avoid estuaries, said Richard Peirce, an author, shark expert and former chair of the UK-based Shark Trust and Shark Conservation Society.Their often-murky waters are a favorite with bull sharks, which are the most likely to attack humans along with great whites and tiger sharks.\u201cAn awful lot of attacks occur in river mouths, where there is silt and other material in suspension in the river \u2013 people washing their clothes, people washing themselves,\u201d said Peirce.Hammerschlag pointed out another area where an encounter is more likely: deeper channels between the shoreline and sandbars farther out.Before you jump in the sea, have a look around the horizon: What do you see? If you see fishing boats, Peirce says \u201cforget it.\u201d\u201cWhether the fishing activity is commercial or recreational, material will often be being discarded, and unwanted dead fish, fish parts and the action of gutting fish are all putting chum in the water and inviting attention from sharks,\u201d he said.Before you go in, watch for unusual fish activity, such as a whole bunch of small- and medium-sized fish jumping out of the water, Hammerschlag said. That\u2019s a possible sign a shark might be nearby.He also advised to not swim within roughly 50 yards of where someone is fishing from shore.Swimming early in the morning or late at night can be lovely, but it\u2019s also the time when a shark attack is most likely.\u201cA lot of shark attacks are cases of mistaken identity,\u201d Peirce says, \u201cdue to reduced visibility and identification ability on the behalf of the shark.\u201dChris Lowe, professor in marine biology and director of the Shark Lab at California State University, Long Beach, advises to \u201cdo your homework\u201d before you go into unfamiliar waters. Bone up a little bit on species you might encounter in different places.If you have any questions, ask a local lifeguard. He said they are a great resource.\u201cI always recommend people go to guarded beaches. It\u2019s a lot safer,\u201d he said.\u201cBe careful with jewelry, anything that flashes because sharks are always looking for fish.\u201d Lowe said.In murky water, a shark may think that flash is a sign of a meal. \u201cAnd you don\u2019t want your hand or foot to get confused with that.\u201d\u201cProbably the most important thing is to follow your gut,\u201d Hammerschlag said. \u201cIf you feel wary about getting in the water \u2026 just don\u2019t go in the water.\u201d\u201cA lot of people who have been bitten actually said they had a weird sensation before that, like they had an inner voice telling them to get out of the water and they didn\u2019t listen to it,\u201d he said.So you\u2019re being circled by a shark. The worst thing you can do right now is panic.\u201cDon\u2019t start splashing around \u2013 you\u2019re just going to excite, incite and encourage the shark\u2019s interest,\u201d said Peirce.Humans, apes, dogs and cats all have paws and hands. If we want to explore something we pick it up and we touch it, we feel it, we put it to our nose.\u201cA shark has got no paws or hands, so if it wants to explore something, the only capability it\u2019s got to do that is to put it in its mouth,\u201d said Peirce.\u201cThat\u2019s why we often get exploratory bites which don\u2019t result in death and sometimes don\u2019t even result in serious injury. If you go swimming and splashing away, you\u2019re almost inviting the shark to come give you an exploratory or an attack bite.\u201dAs the shark swims around you, keep your head on a swivel and try to maintain eye contact.\u201cSharks are ambush predators,\u201d Peirce explained. \u201cIf you\u2019re turning around and facing it the whole time while it circles you, it\u2019s not going to be half as comfortable as if it\u2019s able to sneak up from behind.\u201dHammerschlag concurred, saying you should posture your body toward the shark so it knows you see it and you\u2019re following it. Then slowly back up toward your exit to a boat or shore.If you\u2019re surfing, track the shark with your board, Lowe said. \u201cLet the shark know it\u2019s being watched.\u201dMarine biologists and shark divers Adriana Fragola and Kayleigh Grant show how that eye contact method works with tiger sharks. In a viral TikTok video (see top of story), the shark is seen as Fragola splashes away, capturing its attention. She turns around, faces the approaching shark, remains still in the water and gently deflects the shark away with her hand.\u201cYou\u2019re definitely never going to outswim or outrun a shark if it were actually chasing you,\u201d Fragola says in the video.This is where it gets complicated. If a shark is clearly in attack mode, you need to make yourself as big as possible in the water, according to Peirce.\u201cThe bigger you are in the water, the more respect you\u2019ll get,\u201d he said.But if the shark seems to simply be passing through, Peirce\u2019s advice is to roll up into a ball.\u201cIf a shark sees you as a competitor for its food source, that can be one reason it attacks you,\u201d he explained.\u201cIf I didn\u2019t want to be seen by a great white shark as a competitor \u2013 and if it wasn\u2019t showing massive interest in me \u2013 I would actually curl up so he shows even less interest in me.\u201dThis isn\u2019t a bear, it\u2019s a shark. If you find yourself in an aggressive encounter, give it hell: punch, kick and poke at sensitive spots \u2013 but be careful where you aim.\u201cThere\u2019s all this talk about punching a shark in the nose. That\u2019s OK, but remember that just underneath the nose is a mouth,\u201d said Peirce.\u201cThis is a moving object in the water and you\u2019re not staying still either, so what you don\u2019t want to do is end up effectively punching at the mouth or anywhere near it.\u201dA good shot to the gills can also do the job: \u201cThe gills are very sensitive \u2013 giving a shark a whack in the gills isn\u2019t a bad idea.\u201dAre you carrying anything with you? If so, turn it into a weapon.\u201cIf you\u2019re a diver with an underwater camera, use it, if you\u2019re a snorkeler, rip off your snorkel and use it to poke the shark,\u201d Peirce says.How to survive an alligator attack -- or better yet, avoid one entirely\u201cI\u2019ve had a lot of sharks come at me, and it\u2019s (been) enough to use a shark billy \u2013 a small metal rod between two and three feet long \u2013 and I\u2019ve just given them a little nudge on their nose.\u201dIt\u2019s a good idea to swim with other people, Lowe said. Not only does that decrease the chances of an attack, he said, but you\u2019ve got someone to assist you to a boat or shore if you are bitten.If you\u2019re a diver and you run into trouble, try to get into a position where the shark can\u2019t get behind you, says Peirce.\u201cKeep your back to something like a coral reef. Then you\u2019ve only got one direction to look. You\u2019re protected from behind, for example, and that enables you to keep the shark in sight in front of you and maybe swim to the top of the reef slowly to where your boat is.\u201dDisplace the least amount of water possible. Try not to thrash and splash around as you gradually swim backwards toward shore.\u201cYou must try and keep the animal in sight and very slowly and gently try and swim backwards and get into shallow water. Again, you\u2019ve got to be careful \u2013 large sharks can attack in very shallow depths.\u201dDoing the above may help to a degree, but Peirce says the likelihood of escaping without injury when a big shark attacks is slim.\u201cIf a white shark is in full attack mode, there\u2019s not much you\u2019re going to be able to do at that point,\u201d he says.This article, first published in 2015, is updated periodically."

        "link": "https://edition.cnn.com/style/article/met-gala-rarely-seen-photos-2023/index.html",
        "text": "Written byThis year's Met Gala, widely known as fashion's biggest night out, is back on May 1 \u2014 and the stars are sure to turn up this year for the theme \"In honor of Karl,\" four years after the death of fashion giant Karl Lagerfeld.The event, held at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City, coincides with the opening of a retrospective of Lagerfeld's work on display at the museum's Costume Institute. The German designer was best known for helming the creative direction of Chanel for more than three decades, and Fendi for half a century, but he also left his mark on Chlo\u00e9, Patou and Balmain during his career, in addition to running his own eponymous label.Met Gala 2023: Everything we know about the theme, hosts and guestsWhile red carpet photos of the Met Gala have become instantly accessible, documentation of the splashy gala has changed in recent years, asphotographers have largely been limited to snapping attendees' highly posed entrances; the images that come from the tightly controlled press area are polished and repetitive. To see celebrities letting loose (the likes of Bella Hadid and Marc Jacobsgathering in the bathroomfor smoking breaks, for example) you'd have to turn to after-party photos or their Instagram feeds.Images from the galas of yesteryear are enticing because of their nostalgia factor and retro styling, but they also reveal a more relaxed atmosphere.Photographer Rose Hartman could sense the close friendship between Lynda Carter and Blaine Trump as they shared a laugh, but also noted how glamorous they looked while doing so.Photographer Rose Hartman, who photographed the gala for decades until the early 2000s, recalled over the phone a time when there was more freedom to move around and engage with attendees. In 1986, she photographed actress Lynda Carter and socialite Blaine Trump mid-laugh.\"They were just so happily speaking to one another rather than posing,\" Hartman told CNN in 2020. \"I always try whenever possible to capture people who are engaged with one another.\"Met Gala red carpet: A history of one of New York's most glamorous affairsPhotographer Ron Galella, who has photographed the gala since 1967, had a system in place to grab the best shots, from arrivals at coat check to the museum floor and dinner. \"It was easy to shoot inside,\" he wrote via e-mail in 2020. \"A New York Press card was all you needed to gain entry.\" (When press passes eventually became limited, there were years he smuggled himself in through the employee entrance.)Cher smokes a cigarette during 1974's \"Romantic and Glamorous Hollywood Design Exhibition\" Met Gala.Over the decades, since the event's first iteration in 1948, the gala has transformed from a swanky fete at off-site locations like Manhattan's Rainbow Room into a spectacle of fashion. Socialites and artists have ceded the spotlight to A-list celebrities, who make headlines for how they choose to interpret, or flout, the theme of the night.The theme is based on the Costume Institute's new exhibition, such as this year's \"Karl Lagerfeld: A Line of Beauty.\" Other themes have leaned more conceptual, from 2019's \"Camp: Notes on Fashion\" and 2018's \"Heavenly Bodies: Fashion and the Catholic Imagination.\" But individual designers have been honored in previous years, including Rei Kawakubo in 2017, and Alexander McQueen, the year after his death, in 2011.Ron Galella snapped this light moment of Iman, Paloma Picasso and Raphael Lopez Sanchez at the 1983 Met Gala, which honored the work of Yves St. Laurent.The shift in guest list and atmosphere was largely due to a generational change in vision. In the 1970s, Vogue editor Diana Vreeland positioned the gala as the opening soiree of the Institute's major exhibitions and invited the cr\u00e8me de la cr\u00e8me of the fashion world and New York society. Her successor, Anna Wintour, has favored high-profile musicians, actors and entertainment figures, using the five-figure tickets to the event to raise millions of dollars each year.Andr\u00e9 Leon Talley's possessions fetch almost $3.6 million at auctionIn 1999, Wintour's first year as chair of the event, Hartman snapped a photograph of the Vogue editor-in-chief walking in with former editor-at-large Andr\u00e9 Leon Talley, whopassed awayin 2022. The image of them is joyful, with both editors resplendent in costume and caught in motion.Supermodels Kate Moss and Christy Turlington goof around at the 1995 Met Gala.\"I love the fact that they are walking rather than standing,\" Hartman said. \"I love the gesture of their movement.\"Galella's vast archive of Met Gala images, which he published in a book in 2019, also shows the endearing gestures between celebrities when they don't anticipate the flash of a camera. In 1983, he photographed supermodel Iman and designer Paloma Picasso laughing as Picasso's husband bent low to embrace the statuesque Iman by her waist. In 1995, he caught Christy Turlington seemingly teasing Kate Moss, slipping a finger into the dangerously low-cut back of Moss's white gown.Galella believes it's a universal feeling to want to see the entertainment and fashion elite let their guards down. \"We see them in movies, we see them as superstars. But I want to see them as humans,\" hepreviouslytold Forbes. \"How beautiful are they when they're not acting?\""

        "link": "https://edition.cnn.com/style/article/king-charles-model-kiss-australia/index.html",
        "text": "Written byDelving into the archives of pop culture history,\"Remember When?\"is a CNN Style series offering a nostalgic look at the celebrity outfits that defined their eras.It was a beautiful day on Cottesloe Beach in Perth, Western Australia in March 1979. Prince Charles, the then 30-year-old eldest son of Queen Elizabeth II \u2014 andfuture King\u2014 was touring the state on behalf of his mother.South African opera star will perform at coronation of King Charles IIIAs he finished his regular 6.30 a.m. swim, Charles was intercepted by Jane Priest, a bikini-clad 26-year-old model who giggled as she placed her hands on the bashful royal's shoulders and, to his surprise, planted a kiss on his cheek.The \"Bond\" moment \u2014 which was caught on camera \u2014 was not as spontaneous as it may first appear. In a 2013documentary, royal photographer Kent Gavin admitted to asking Priest to \"run up and kiss\" Charles to create a photo opportunity.But in a 2012 interview with London's Evening Standard newspaper, Priest explained how the rendezvous, intended to \"make Charles more accessible,\" did not go exactly as planned.\"When he saw me, he dived into the water, so I thought I'd follow him in, but as I went in, he got out,\" Priest told the newspaper. \"So I followed him out, hair ruined, make-up ruined, and I felt like such an idiot. I actually went and put my hands on his chest to give him a kiss and Charles said: 'No, I can't touch you, I can't touch you.'\"Priest ran up to Prince Charles to give him a kiss.Nevertheless, the photo opportunity \u2014 which was heralded as showing the transformation of a once awkward young man into a desirable prince \u2014 certainly made waves, appearing on front pages across the globe. It remains one of the rare occasions a British prince has been photographed in swimwear, and certainly in such short shorts.Life-sized chocolate King Charles III sculpture unveiled to celebrate coronationIn recent years, men's micro-shorts have enjoyed something of a renaissance. No longer considered a sartorial taboo, viral street-style snaps of actors Paul Mescal and Milo Ventimiglia have demonstrated that short-shorts deserve to become a summer staple once again. In 2020, apublic demandfor more men in 5\" inseam shorts swept TikTok with hundreds of dedicated videos \u2014 today the phrase boasts over52 million views.The 1979 image also bestowed overnight fame on Priest, then a young mother of one, who went on to have a successful modeling and television career. \"Here was one of the most powerful men in the world and he was absolutely adorable,\" she recalled to the Evening Standard. \"I was totally overawed for those couple of minutes.\""

        "name": "\u2018I was up to my waist down a hippo\u2019s throat.\u2019 He survived, and here\u2019s his advice",
        "link": "https://edition.cnn.com/travel/article/hippo-attack-avoid-survive-paul-templer/index.html",
        "text": "Paul Templer was living his best life.He was 28 and conducting tours in his native Zimbabwe, with a focus on photographic safaris.He had been away for a few years, including a stint in the British army. But he had returned to Africa\u2019s bush country \u201cand fell back in love with it. The wildlife, the flora, the fauna, the great outdoors, the space \u2013 just everything about it. I was at home.\u201dTempler said Zimbabwe\u2019s guide certification program was rigorous, and there was a lot of pride among the guides who passed. He reveled in showing tourists the area\u2019s majestic wildlife \u2013 including the water-loving, very territorial hippos.\u201cIt was idyllic,\u201d he told CNN Travel recently. \u201cLife was really, really good \u2013 until one day I had a really bad day at the office.\u201dMarch 9, 1996. A Saturday. Templer learned a good friend who was to lead a canoe safari down the Zambezi River had malaria. He agreed to take his pal\u2019s place. \u201cI loved that stretch of the river. It was an area I know like the back of my hand.\u201dThe expedition consisted of six safari clients (four Air France crewmembers and a couple from Germany), three apprentice guides plus Templer. They had three canoes \u2013 clients in the first two seats and a guide in the back. Then one apprentice guide was in a one-person safety kayak.And down the famed Zambezi they went. \u201cThings were going the way they were supposed to go. Everyone was having a pretty good time.\u201dEventually, they came across a pod of about a dozen hippos. That\u2019s not unexpected on the Zambezi, Africa\u2019s fourth-longest river. They weren\u2019t alarmed at first as they were at a safe distance. But \u201cwe were getting closer, and I was trying to take evasive action. \u2026 The idea was let\u2019s just paddle safely around the hippos.\u201dTempler\u2019s canoe led the way, with the other two canoes and kayak to follow. He pulled into a little channel waiting on the others. But the third canoe had fallen back from the group and was off the planned course. Templer\u2019s not sure how that happened.Suddenly, there\u2019s this big thud. And I see the canoe, like the back of it, catapulted up into the air.Paul Templer\u201cSuddenly, there\u2019s this big thud. And I see the canoe, like the back of it, catapulted up into the air. And Evans, the guide in the back of the canoe, catapulted out of the canoe.\u201d The clients managed to remain in the canoe somehow.\u201cEvans is in the water, and the current is washing Evans toward a mama hippo and her calf 150 meters [490 feet] away. \u2026 So I know I\u2019ve got to get him out quickly. I don\u2019t have time to drop my clients off.\u201d He yells to Ben, one of the other guides, to retrieve the clients who were in the canoe that had been attacked.Ben got the clients to safety on a rock in the middle of the river that hippos couldn\u2019t climb.Meanwhile, Templer turned his canoe around to get Evans. The plan was to pull alongside of him and pull him into Templer\u2019s canoe.\u201cI was paddling towards him \u2026 getting closer, and I saw this bow wave coming towards me. If you\u2019ve ever seen any of those old movies with a torpedo coming toward a ship, it was kind of like that. I knew it was either a hippo or a really large crocodile coming at me,\u201d he said.\u201cBut I also knew that if I slapped the blade of my paddle on water \u2026 that\u2019s really loud. And the percussion underwater seems to turn the animals away,\u201d he said. \u201cSo I slapped the water, and as it was supposed to do, the torpedo wave stops.\u201dHe was getting closer to Evans, but they were also getting closer to the female and calf.\u201cI\u2019m leaning over \u2013 it\u2019s kind of a made-for-Hollywood movie \u2013 Evans is reaching up. \u2026 Our fingers almost touched. And then the water between us just erupted. Happened so fast I didn\u2019t see a thing.\u201dWhat happened next was nightmarish and surreal.\u201cMy world went dark and strangely quiet.\u201d Templer said it took a few seconds to figure out what was going on.\u201cFrom the waist down, I could feel the water. I could feel I was wet in the river. From my waist up, it was different. I was warm, and it wasn\u2019t wet like the river, but it wasn\u2019t dry either. And it was just incredible pressure on my lower back. I tried to move around; I couldn\u2019t.\u201cI realized I was up to my waist down a hippo\u2019s throat.\u201dThere\u2019s a good reason a fully grown hippopotamus can fit a large portion of a fully grown adult in its mouth. Hippos can grow up to 16.5 feet long (5 meters), 5.2 feet tall (1.6 meters) and weigh up to 4.5 tons (4 metric tonnes),.They sport enormous mouths and.Their teeth might be the most frightening thing of all. Their molars are used for eating plants, but, which might reach 20 inches (51 centimeters), are for defense and fighting. Their bite is almostthan that of a lion. One bite from a hippo can possibly cut a human body in half.They\u2019re found naturally in various parts sub-Saharan Africa, particularly in East and Southern Africa, living in or near rivers and other water sources. (And they are anthanks to escapees from drug lord Pablo Escobar\u2019s menagerie).Hippos are very territorial and might aggressively attack any animal encroaching on their territory, including hyenas, lions and crocodiles.They also kill people. That we know for sure. Many internet sources say around 500 a year, but an exact figure is still uncertain because some attacks and deaths come in very remote regions and don\u2019t get reported.\u201cThe question I get asked the most when people find out I study hippos is: \u2018Is it true hippos kill more people than any animal?\u2019 Rebecca Lewison, conservation ecologist and associate professor at San Diego State University, told CNN Travel in an email interview.How to survive a cobra bite -- or better yet, avoid one entirely\u201cI\u2019m not entirely sure where that started but \u2026 there is no authority or reliable data. People are surprised that hippos kill people. They look slow, and they are mostly in water. There are some nonfatal interactions, but people (or hippos) tend to fare badly from interactions.\u201dDr. Philip Muruthi, chief scientist and vice president of species conservation and science of the African Wildlife Fund, said the AWF doesn\u2019t have a credible source on the number of attacks or fatalities either.While more stats need to be collected,that the probability of being killed by a hippopotamus attack is in the range of 29% to 87% \u2013 higher than that of a grizzly bear attack at 4.8%, shark attack at 22.7% and crocodile attack at 25%.Those were rather bad odds of survival working against Templer.\u201cI\u2019m guessing I was wedged so far down its throat it must have been uncomfortable because he spat me out. So I burst to the surface, sucked a lungful of fresh air and I came face to face with Evans, the guide who I was trying to rescue. And I said, \u2018We got to get out of here!\u2019 \u201dSo once again, I\u2019m up to my waist down the hippo\u2019s throat. But this time, my legs are trapped but my hands are free.Paul TemplerBut Evans was in serious trouble. Templer started swimming back for him \u201cand I was just moving in for your classic lifesaver\u2019s hold when \u2013 WHAM! \u2013 I got hit from below. So once again, I\u2019m up to my waist down the hippo\u2019s throat. But this time my legs are trapped but my hands are free.\u201dHe tried to go for his gun, but he was being thrashed around so much he couldn\u2019t grab it. The hippo \u2013 which turned out to be an older, aggressive male \u2013 spat Templer out a second time.\u201cThis time when I come to the surface I look around, there\u2019s no sign of Evans.\u201d Templer assumed Evans had been rescued, and he tried to escape himself.\u201cI\u2019m making pretty good progress and I\u2019m swimming along there and I come up for the stroke and swimming freestyle and I look under my arm \u2013 and until my dying day I\u2019ll remember this \u2013 there\u2019s this hippo charging in towards me with his mouth wide open bearing in before he scores a direct hit.\u201dThis time, Templer was sideways in the hippo\u2019s mouth, legs dangling out one side of the mouth, shoulders and head on the other side of its mouth.\u201cAnd then he just goes berserk. \u2026 When hippos are fighting, the way they fight is they try to tear apart and just destroy whatever it is they\u2019re attacking,\u201d Templer said.\u201cFor me, fortunately everything was happening in slow motion. So when he\u2019d go under water, I\u2019d hold my breath.  When we were on the surface, I would take a deep breath and I would try to hold onto tusks that were boring through me\u201d to stop from being ripped apart.Templer said one of the clients watching the horror later described it like a \u201cvicious dog trying to rip apart a rag doll.\u201dHe figures the whole attack took about three and a half minutes.Meanwhile, apprentice guide Mack in the safety kayak \u2013 \u201cshowing incredible bravery, risking his life to save mine \u2013 pulls his boat in inches from my face.\u201d Templer managed to grab a handle on the kayak, and \u201cMack dragged me to the relative safety of this rock.\u201dThe expedition was still in one hell of a mess, though.People living near hippo territory are more likely victims of attacks than tourists, said Lewison.\u201cMost of the attacks happen in the water, but because hippos raid crops on farms, there are also attacks on people trying to protect their crops. There are some tourists, but largely the attacks are happening to local residents,\u201d Lewison said.Human encroachment from Africa\u2019s booming populationmakes matters worse, increasing the chances of deadly interactions, she said.You encounter a bear in the wild. Do you know what to do next?Despite the encounters gone bad, sub-Saharan Africa depends on hippos.\u201cHippos are important ecosystem engineers of the ecology of freshwater areas they inhabit. This is through nutrient recycling from dung (they consume large amounts of vegetation),\u201d Muruthi said.\u201cHippos attack not to eat people, but to get them the hell away from them,\u201d Lewison said. \u201cI don\u2019t think hippos are particularly aggressive, but I think when under pressure, they attack.\u201dBack on the rock in the Zambezi, Templer asked Mack where Evans was. Mack said, \u201cHe\u2019s gone, man, he\u2019s just gone.\u201dTempler knew he needed to come up with a plan to get them off the rock and to the riverbank, but \u201cfirst I needed to settle myself down.\u201dHe assessed the situation: One man missing. The first aid kit, radio and gun all gone. Six scared clients, two canoes and one paddle left. And his own body was shattered.\u201cMy left foot was especially bad; it looked as if someone had tried to beat a hole through it with a hammer.\u201d He couldn\u2019t move his arms. One arm from elbow down was \u201ccrushed to a pulp.\u201dBlood was bubbling out of his mouth. They realized his lung was punctured. Mack rolled Templer over and could see a gaping hole in his back and plugged it with Saran Wrap from a plate of snacks.Templer made the call: No matter the risk, they had to get off that rock.He was loaded into a canoe. Ben paddled. The hippo kept bumping the canoe. He went from being terrified to calm on that ride back.He described \u201ca profound spiritual experience in which I had this incredible sense of peace and realization this was my moment of choice. Like do I go, or do I stay? Do I close my eyes and drift off, or do I fight my way through this and stick around?\u201dIt was so intense I thought I was going to die, and when I didn\u2019t, I kind of wished I would.Paul Templer on the pain after the attack\u201cI chose to stick around, and as soon as I made that choice, it was more pain than I could ever imagine I could endure. It was so intense I thought I was going to die, and when I didn\u2019t, I kind of wished I would.\u201dBen and Templer made it out of the river, but without finding Evans. His body was found three days later. They concluded he had drowned because he didn\u2019t have any signs of animal attack on him.\u201cEvans did nothing wrong. The fact that he died was purely a tragedy.\u201dMeanwhile, some people on shore had realized something was wrong in the river. A well-trained Zimbabwe rescue team was able to safely ferry everyone else off the rock.\u201cAnd that was my bad day at the office.\u201dTempler was out of the river but not out of the woods.It took eight hours to drive him to the nearest hospital. In a month\u2019s time, he had several major surgeries. He thought he would lose one leg and both arms. His surgeon didn\u2019t think he\u2019d live.But not only did the surgeon save Templer\u2019s life, he saved his legs and one arm. The other arm, however, was beyond salvation.If you're attacked by an alligator, here's how to fight for your lifeHe realized that in the ICU when he woke up and was feeling for his left hand. It was gone. \u201cI just remember feeling devastated. I spent my whole life being active and it was almost more than I could bare.\u201dBut then he was flooded with relief to realize his right arm and legs had been saved. For the next month, he was \u201cemotionally all over the map.\u201dHe got physical and occupational therapy in Zimbabwe and then more in the United Kingdom. He got a prosthesis \u201cand then just started trying to get back to life.\u201dTempler, Muruthi and Lewison all say safe outings start with education \u2013 and avoiding trouble in the first place.\u201cHippos have no interest in dealing with people. Stay away from them, and they will leave you alone. They are not hunting humans,\u201d Lewison said.\u201cDo not get close to them,\u201d Muruthi said. \u201cThey don\u2019t want any intrusion. \u2026 They\u2019re not predators; it\u2019s by accident if they\u2019re injuring people.\u201dWant close-up views and photos of the creatures? Instead of venturing too close, invest in good binoculars and telephoto camera lenses.Follow the rules. If you are a tourist, and it says \u2018Stay in your vehicle,\u2019 then stay in your vehicle.Philip Muruthi on avoiding hippo attacksDo not walk along well-worn hippo paths, stay close to your group and don\u2019t approach them from behind, Muruthi said.\u201cFollow the rules. If you are a tourist, and it says \u2018Stay in your vehicle,\u2019 then stay in your vehicle. And even when you\u2019re in your vehicle, don\u2019t drive it right to the animal.\u201dMuruthi also advised that your party make some noise in areas known for hippos. \u201cIt\u2019s good for them to know you\u2019re around.\u201d\u201cHippos usually come out of water late in the evening and at night to forage, so avoid trekking along the river at that time,\u201d Muruthi said. Also stay on high alert during the dry season when food is scarce.Get to know the signs of disturbed hippos, Muruthi advised, in case you wander too closely. An agitated one will open its mouth wide and yawn as aggressive display. Also watch for a head thrown back, shaking of the head, grunting and snorting.\u201cThese are signs you should have left already!\u201d Muruthi said.If you\u2019ve attracted unwanted attention, Muruthi said to always remember you cannot outrun a hippo. They may look sluggish, but they can run 30 mph (almost 43 kph). Instead, you should try to climb a tree or find an obstacle to put between you and the hippo such as a rock or anthill.Muruthi, Lewison and Templer all said never stay between a hippo and the water. If it\u2019s charging you, run parallel to the water source. As with so many other protective female animals, never get between a mama hippo and her young, Templer said.He was alone, deep in the moutains. And a rattlesnake just bit him.What if you\u2019re in a small watercraft?\u201cTypically, if a hippo is going to be attacking, you\u2019ll see it coming way before. There will be that bow wave. \u2026 If you slap the water, the percussion 99.9 times out of 100 will turn the hippo,\u201d Templer said. \u201cIf you\u2019re in a canoe and a hippo knocks you in the water, get away from the canoe. The hippo is going for this big shape, getting it off its territory.\u201dIt\u2019s also safer to view hippos on the water in a larger vessel, which the animal would have a harder time capsizing, Muruthi said.Unlike attacks by some other wild animals, humans are almost defenseless once an attack by a large hippo begins.\u201cOnce attacked, there is nothing you can do,\u201d Muruthi said. \u201cFight for dear life and watch for any chance to escape.\u201d He said you could try to poke at the eyes or any spot that might inflict unexpected pain. But given the size just of a hippo head, even that\u2019s a tall order.Hippos typically hole punch you, so there isn\u2019t much you can do if they get hold of you.Rebecca Lewison\u201cHippos typically hole punch you, so there isn\u2019t much you can do if they get hold of you,\u201d Lewison said.Based on his attack, Templer said try not to panic \u201cwhen dragged underwater. Remember to suck in air if on the surface.\u201dAnother hippo attack survivoralso was able to conserve her breath. She also grabbed the hippo\u2019s snout, and one expert in the video theorizes that might have startled the hippo into letting her go.Two years after that attack, Templer said that he and a team made the longest recorded descent of the Zambezi River to date. It took three months and covered 1,600 miles (2,575 kilometers).How did Templer find the resilience to reclaim his life?After a particularly rough day trying to maneuver in a wheelchair, he said that his surgeon told him: \u201cYou\u2019re the sum of your choices. You\u2019re exactly who, what and where you choose to be in life.\u201dTempler said he focused on what\u2019s possible vs. what he\u2019s lost. \u201cIf you look for what\u2019s possible, it generally is.\u201dTempler later moved to United States; got married to the sister of a journalist on the record-setting Zambezi trip; wrote the book; and is a speaker.Should people be afraid toeven go on safari \u2013 especially in hippo areas \u2013 after learning of a harrowing story like Templer\u2019s?Muruthi said go, but go smartly. Be sure to get advice from professional tour guides \u2013 and then follow their guidance, Muruthi said. \u201cIn Kenya, for example, contact the,\u201d he said.Templer said his attack was an \u201canomaly,\u201d and he doesn\u2019t want anyone to be dissuaded by what happened on his 1996 river run.\u201cMy biggest counsel would be: Absolutely go and do it. But hook yourself up with someone who knows what they\u2019re doing out there. But by all means, go out \u2026 and experience it.\u201d"

        "name": "Why this surreal 'dripping' watch has become a cult celebrity favorite",
        "link": "https://edition.cnn.com/style/article/cartier-crash-surreal-luxury-watch/index.html",
        "text": "Written byPrized by collectors and sought after by stars from Jay-Z to Kim Kardashian West, the Cartier Crash has become one of theluxurymarket's most unlikely hot-ticket watches. Straight out of the swinging '60s, its dripping shape looks more like one of Salvador Dal\u00ed's Surrealist melting clocks than a celebrity timepiece.The Crash also has an origin story \u2014 albeit an apocryphal one \u2014 that's as unusual as its warped, asymmetric case.The legend begins in 1967 London, when a customer arrived at Cartier's New Bond Street boutique to repair a watch damaged in a car accident. The fiery heat of the crash had, or so the story goes, melted its once-oval case. Jean-Jacques Cartier, the great-grandson of founder Louis-Fran\u00e7ois Cartier, was \"so seduced by the shape that (he) decided to reproduce it,\" the company claims in marketing materials shared with CNN.Few are convinced by this tale \u2014 not least Jean-Jacques's granddaughter Francesca Cartier Brickell, whose account is more straightforward. In her 2019 book \"The Cartiers,\" she wrote that her grandfather and designer Rupert Emmerson adjusted the already-popular Cartier Maxi Oval model for loyal clients demanding unique, custom-designed watches. They realized a metal case could be made to look \"as though it had been in a crash\" by \"pinching the ends at a point and putting a kink in the middle,\" she added.A Cartier Crash pictured at the Salon International de la Haute Horlogerie (SIHH) watch fair in Geneva, Switzerland, in 2018.Regardless of how Crash was born, the myth has only added to its cultural cache, according to Benjamin Clymer, founder of the luxury watch siteHodinkee.\"I think the story that has been perpetuated is just so compelling, so wonderful and romantic and crazy,\" he said in a video call. \"And then the name, the Cartier Crash with the double consonants \u2014 it just rings.\"Only a dozen or so watches are thought to have emerged from this first production run. The Crash's irregular shape made it laborious to make \u2014 and Cartier's signature Roman numerals and sword shaped hands proved difficult to read.The Broker, The Astronaut and The Vampire: Enter the mysterious world of Soviet watch collectors\"That first Crash watch caused a lot of headaches,\" Brickell quotes her grandfather as saying. \"You see, it's all very well coming up with a good-looking design, but it had to tell the time too! And because the dial was irregular, the numbers weren't at the standard places.\"The watch was far from an instant hit. One the era's biggest movie stars, Stewart Granger, was among the first customers, though he returned his within a week because it was \"too unusual,\" according to Brickell.\"I don't think the design did resonate especially back then,\" the author said over email, adding that it was \"almost too radical for Cartier's clientele\" at the time.Cartier's New Bond street store pictured in 1978.It was nonetheless an important development for the company's London outpost, which at that time only stocked Cartier watches from France and Switzerland. Jean-Jacques \"really did want to push things forward,\" Clymer said, adding the Crash helped establish the British branch's reputation for design.\"From a geometric perspective, it was just so different than everything else out there.\"The very first Crash is thought to have sold for around $1,000 (about $9,000 in today's money). But the model has soared in value on the resale market in recent years.In 2021,one dating to 1970fetched over 806,000 Swiss Francs ($908,000) at Sotheby's in Geneva, setting a record for the model. Less than a year later, an exceptionally rare 1967 original smashed the record again when it sold forover $1.65 millionvia the online watch auction site Loupe This.These astronomical prices can be attributed, in part, to the model's scarcity on the collectors' market, according to Tom Heap, a watch specialist at Sotheby's London. Although Cartier does not publicize the total number made, experts believe it is in the hundreds, rather than the thousands. They exist in \"immeasurably small quantities,\" Heap added on a video call.Kris Jenner attends the amfAR Cannes Gala 2019.After the initial batch, Cartier continued to produce Crashes on demand. It went on to produce new versions in white gold, pink gold and platinum (most notably in a limited edition run in 1991, though these are credited to Cartier Paris and usually sell for less than older London models).In 2018, Cartier then made two new limited-edition Crashes available via its New Bond Street store in 2018 \u2014 one with an 18-carat yellow gold case and the other made from white gold and encrusted with diamonds. They were moderately priced at 27,000 euros ($30,000) and 65,000 euros ($72,000), respectively, though Heap said they were mostly reserved for Cartier's \"top-tier clients.\"From Queen Victoria to Cardi B, how this legacy watchmaker found itself in the zeitgeistRarity alone cannot explain the sudden surge in prices, however. Heap recalls speaking to dealers who, less than 10 years ago, turned down opportunities to buy Crashes for around \u00a360,000 (now around $65,000), even though they would now sell for many times that. Clymer meanwhile said that while he saw revived interest in collector circles in 2016 or 2017, the Crash was \"not super sought-after\" even five years ago.The turning point, he said, came in 2018 when Kanye West was seen wearing one on David Letterman's Netflix special. \"I'll give credit where credit's due,\" Clymer said. \"I think it was Kanye West wearing a crash that really put it back on the map.\"Tyler the Creator wore a Cartier Crash in his \"Lumberjack\" music video.Subsequent celebrity endorsements have helped send prices skywards. Tyler the Creator, for example, sported a Crash in his 2021 \"Lumberjack\" video, before being spotted wearing one at a Cartier watch auction in Monaco later that year. \"Schitt's Creek\" star Dan Levy meanwhile wore one to the Met Gala.Heap welcomed the development as an antidote to the \"big, ostentatious diamond-set pieces\" normally seen on celebrity wrists. \"It's almost like a dress watch style, with a leather strap and a small-sized case,\" he added. \"I think that's very cool.\"The Crash's appeal among collectors may speak to wider aesthetic trends. It is perhaps no coincidence that its revived fortunes coincide with renewed interest in the Surrealist movement, which is the subject of recent (and forthcoming) exhibitions at institutions including theMetropolitan Museum of Art,Tate Modernand London'sDesign Museum.Two art curators had a mystery on their hands. Was an unusual Dal\u00ed painting actually his?How much, if at all, Jean-Jacques Cartier and Emmerson were influenced by Dal\u00ed's 1931 painting \"The Persistence of Memory\" \u2014 the iconic image of clocks appearing to melt in a sparse landscape \u2014 may be lost to history. Regardless, Clymer believes the connection between horology and culture at large reflects luxury watches' growing role in mainstream consciousness.\"All important wristwatches are receiving so much more attention now than even three years ago, pre-Covid\" he said, adding: \"So, when there is something going on (in broader culture), like a revived interest in Surrealism, it's much easier for people to make the connection between that and a Cartier Crash.\"Jay-Z attended the London premiere of \"The Harder They Fall\" wearing a Cartier Crash.For Heap, the Crash's appeal among collectors may also be due to its \"imperfect and very organic\" shape \u2014 one that would be near-impossible to mass produce.\"It looks almost like it's liquid or fluid. When you pick one up, it feels like it's going to move or wobble,\" he added: \"As opposed to a lot of pieces nowadays... you can tell it was made by a person. There's a human element to it.\""

        "text": "Editor\u2019s Note:CNN Original Series \u201c\u201d airs on CNN Sundays at 9 p.m. ET/PT. Sign up to CNN Travel\u2019s four-partfor more on the country and its cuisine.Two simple words can spark mouth-watering bliss or a series of blistering retorts in Texans: Breakfast tacos.In the Lone Star State, who gets the credit for these morning tortilla sensations can be a matter of haba\u00f1ero-hot debate.Ain 2016 helped start a full-on Breakfast Taco War between Austin and San Antonio. While that particular battle eventually settled down, flare-ups continue.But to get a true picture of this simple food with a complex history, we must go beyond Texas and first look atanother place: Mexico.The breakfast taco is actually part of a long parade of foods () whose fuzzy origins and various claims of authenticity spark ferocious debate.There\u2019s one thing we know for darn sure: Today, breakfast tacos are enjoyed on both sides of the Rio Grande River. In her CNN \u201cSearching for Mexico\u201d series, actor Eva Longoria traveled to Monterrey in the state of Nuevo Le\u00f3n.The breakfast taco may be the simplest of street food, but it\u2019s been been hitting the spot for the workers of Monterrey for nearly a century.Eva Longoria in 'Searching for Mexico'There, she enjoyed a breakfast taco with MexicanGerardo Alvarado and Ernesto Esquivel at, which has been serving central Monterrey for nearly 20 years.\u201cThe breakfast taco may be the simplest of street food, but it\u2019s been been hitting the spot for the workers of Monterrey for nearly a century,\u201d narrates Longoria.CNN Travel caught up with Esquivel \u2013 born and raised in the border state of Sonora and resident of Monterrey for more than 10 years \u2013 to find out more.\u201cWhen I arrived in Monterrey, I discovered all the different types of tacos that everyone eats in the morning. You can have a taco of eggs. You can have a taco of meat. You can have a taco of potatoes.\u201dEsquivel describes breakfast tacos as \u201ca really fast food, but not a junkie food.\u201dEsquivel said you can find breakfast tacos in other states in northern Mexico, but Monterrey and the state of Nuevo Le\u00f3n are the culinary epicenter with more places to get them and a larger selection of fillings.Some of the city\u2019s favorites are the machacado (dried beef) with eggs, the(slow-cooked meat, often in a pit) and the deshebrada (shredded beef). In other words, you\u2019re in meat country.Esquivel said the breakfast taco goes back to the early 1900s and perhaps even earlier in Monterrey., a former iron and steel foundry that dates to 1900 but is now a recreational and educational park, helped the breakfast taco get its start in Monterrey. Employees came \u201cto work really early, and so they had to have a really fast breakfast in the morning, and one fast breakfast in the morning is a breakfast taco.\u201dAnd from there, the tacos spread into southern Texas, Esquivel said, which is reflected in the cuisine of today. \u201cI think the flavors here in Monterrey, mostly in the north, are similar to some flavors in Texas.\u201dAlong with Do\u00f1a Mary\u2019s, he suggests these spots for a breakfast taco if you\u2019re in Monterrey:,and.The river may mark a political line between two nations, but it has been no barrier at all to crossings of cuisine and culture. And Texas also shares a passion for the breakfast taco. You can tell that just from all the kerfuffles about them.\u201cNo Texas city can claim the breakfast taco,\u201d says Jos\u00e9 Ralat, the taco editor of Texas Monthly magazine. He places the ultimate credit south of the Rio Grande.\u201cIt comes from Mexico \u2013 where exactly, it\u2019s not really known. Geographically, the most likely source is northern Mexico. There is no literature that I have seen that can point to any particular city in northern Mexico.\u201dAs for today, \u201cthey\u2019re popular in [the Mexican states of] Tamaulipas, Nuevo Le\u00f3n and Coahuila, which all border Texas,\u201d he said.Eddie Vega \u2013 who grew up in McAllen, across from the Mexican city of Reynosa in Tamaulipas state \u2013 is known asHe points out that historically, what\u2019s now south Texas was once part of Mexico.Best Mexican food: 23 dishes to tryBefore 1836, \u201cthe border was further north. All this region was eating a combination of indigenous and Spanish food together.\u201dVega said that growing up, breakfast tacos weren\u2019t some trendy food to him attracting attention from the likes ofand other coastal media.\u201cWhen you get to south Texas, and I\u2019m from the Valley, we had breakfast tacos, but they were in my house. My mom would make them. It\u2019s not something we\u2019d go to a restaurant to get because economically that region is very poor and nobody\u2019s eating out. Or not eating out in the morning especially.\u201dRalat and Vega both said the breakfast taco was staple deep in south Texas and then San Antonio long before Austin got in on the action. So how did Austin become so synonymous with them?Austin has \u201ca great branding mentality, they have a knack for PR. Every year, Austin is flooded with coastal elites checking out South by Southwest,\u201d Ralat said. \u201cThey try some options, and then in their minds, they think it\u2019s an Austin thing. My job is to question the stuff \u2026 and let history speak for itself.\u201dThe capital of Texas is finally earning its grand reputation for great tacosRalat said San Antonio has \u201ca bit of an inferiority complex that they\u2019re often overlooked to the benefit of Austin when San Antonio is older, has more culture, it\u2019s more diverse, and the food is better.\u201d\u201cTo be clear, they\u2019re both Tex Mex towns, and breakfast tacos are Tex Mex. But they\u2019re also border food. When the Eater article came out\u201d\u2013 championing Austin as \u201chome\u201d of the breakfast taco \u2013 \u201cSan Antonians lost their minds.\u201dI don\u2019t know that one city \u2013 San Antonio, Corpus Christi, McAllen, Brownsville or Laredo \u2013 can claim it.Eddie Vega on the breakfast tacoVega said the culinary history is too distant for any one place to stamp itself as originator or king purveyor. \u201cI don\u2019t know that one city \u2013 San Antonio, Corpus Christi, McAllen, Brownsville or Laredo \u2013 can claim it. You have differences with them because of ingredients.\u201dJessica Elizarraras, a Rio Grande Valley native and the executive producer for, said many people have put the origins dispute behind them.\u201cI think at this point we\u2019ve mostly moved on from the great taco war of 2016,\u201d Elizarraras said in an email interview with CNN Travel. \u201cIs there occasional ribbing? Absolutely! Are there great tacos across the state? 1000 percent. The Mexican diaspora is far-reaching and so are their tacos.\u201dShe citesas a detailed settlement of the issue that effectively shows Austin is not the start of the breakfast taco.She also points out the regional differences within Texas.\u201cA flour tortilla in San Antonio tends to lean a bit puffier than its Rio Grande Valley/Coast counterparts.in San Antonio is the best of both worlds: a thin but sturdy tortilla, filled with fun, flavorful combinations.\u201dRalat said he\u2019s now seeing breakfast tacos coast to coast. He was also recently in Nashville and saw them offered there.\u201cI hesitate to eat them at a place that calls them Austin-style. \u2026 I want the food to be high quality. I don\u2019t want it to be spin.\u201dBreakfast tacos are ephemeral as they come, which makes them that much more magical.Jessica ElizarrarasElizarraras suggests people just enjoy them \u2013 with or without huevos (eggs).\u201cBreakfast tacos are ephemeral as they come, which makes them that much more magical,\u201d she said.\u201cBean and cheese is a great example of a breakfast taco that doesn\u2019t have eggs. \u2026 Chicharron en salsa (verde or rojo) is another example of a tasty taco that doesn\u2019t require eggs. Barbacoa \u2013 made using a whole cow-head, and more generally, beef cheeks \u2013 is a classic breakfast taco in San Antonio, often paired with Big Red [soda] for a Sunday morning treat.\u201dIn the end, why does the origin of a type of food even matter?\u201cPart of the issue is erasure. Just like with anything else in our Mexican-American culture, to feel left out of a conversation when you know you\u2019ve part of that conversation for a long time.\u201d Vega said.And back south of the Rio Grande, they are a source of unity, Esquivel said.Eva Longoria: Mexican food is 'so much more' than tacos and tequila\u201cI think the breakfast tacos here in Monterrey \u2026 and the northeast of the country is something that unites everyone.\u201dThey\u2019re popular with the poor, the middle class and the rich, he said. \u201cThe place can be ugly. The place can be like in the streets. But you will see people in suits there eating breakfast tacos.\u201dFor Ralat, breakfast tacos are much more than a great way to start the morning.\u201cI think history, especially food history, is important to know because it provides another mirror for our culture.\u201cIt\u2019s interesting to me that tortillas are the foundation of Mexican culture, and to break bread with someone is a sacred act. So let\u2019s take it literally, and say that you share tacos with someone else. That\u2019s so nice. And it\u2019s just so joyful.\u201d"

        "name": "She met her long lost cousin on a cruise ship",
        "link": "https://edition.cnn.com/travel/article/chance-encounters-reunited-cousins/index.html",
        "text": "When Eileen Monaghan\u2019s cousin Nora died in 2014, Eileen grieved not only the loss of a beloved older relative but also her last link to Ireland.Eileen\u2019s grandmother emigrated from the tiny village of Shalvey, in Donegal, Ireland in the late 1800s. Growing up in the US, young Eileen loved hearing her grandmother\u2019s stories of Ireland and became fascinated by her Irish roots.Today, Eileen and her husband Gerard are travel-loving retirees \u2013 they\u2019ve visited all seven continents and explored some 65 countries \u2013 but for Eileen, no country will ever top Ireland.On past Irish trips, Eileen and Gerard would always make a pilgrimage to Eileen\u2019s grandmother\u2019s old house. Then they\u2019d pop round to cousin Nora\u2019s for a cup of tea and a catch up.\u201cShe\u2019d be charming, delightful and wonderful,\u201d Eileen recalls.Eileen only found out Nora had passed away when an unopened Christmas card was returned across the Atlantic, the sobering word \u201cdeceased\u201d scribbled on the envelope.As Eileen and Gerard mourned their Irish relative, they were saddened by the realization that next time they found their way to Shalvey, there\u2019d be no one ready with the kettle on.The following year, 2015, Eileen celebrated her 70th birthday with a voyage on board Cunard\u2019s Queen Elizabeth cruise ship.\u201cWe wanted to go through the Panama Canal, so we did the Queen Elizabeth down the coast and outside of Costa Rica,\u201d says Eileen.One evening, midway through the trip, Eileen was getting ready for dinner in her cabin, while Gerard was in the elevator, traveling from the seventh to ninth floor. As the elevator made its way up the ship, Gerard tuned into a conversation playing out between the couple standing next to him.They sounded Irish, which intrigued Gerard. He loves speaking with people on his travels, and finds accents fascinating, so he decided to initiate conversation.\u201cLovely lilt,\u201d he commented. \u201cWhere are you from?\u201d\u201cFrom the North, County Derry,\u201d said the man.\u201cOh that\u2019s next door to Donegal,\u201d said Gerard, adding that he\u2019d spent some time in Ireland. \u201cMy wife\u2019s family is from Shalvey.\u201dHis elevator companion looked surprised.\u201cI had a cousin in Shalvey, but she died last year,\u201d he said.Gerard stared at him, disbelievingly. What were the chances? But yet the similarities were striking, and tiny Shalvey\u2019s population numbered no more than 15 people.\u201cNora?\u201d he asked.\u201cNora,\u201d replied the man, his eyes widening.The elevator doors opened and the occupants got out, looking at one another in disbelief.The Irish couple introduced themselves as Paddy and Hazel McEvoy. In turn, Gerard gave his name and Eileen\u2019s. It dawned on them all that Eileen and Paddy were distant relatives who\u2019d never met, but were about to be unexpectedly reunited on a cruise ship in the middle of the ocean.The group arranged to reconvene for a post-dinner drink, with Gerard adding that Eileen was celebrating a significant birthday.\u201cMy wife was just saying how it was a shame she didn\u2019t have any family on board to celebrate with,\u201d he said. \u201cNow she does.\u201dWith that, Gerard rushed back to the cabin to tell Eileen.\u201cWe\u2019re going to meet your cousin,\u201d he told her, hardly believing the words as they came out of his mouth.Eileen couldn\u2019t believe it either. She was in shock when she met Paddy at the cruise bar. He welcomed her with an enveloping hug and friendly smile.\u201cI don\u2019t believe this is happening,\u201d Eileen recalls thinking.The unexpected family reunion turned into an hours-long conversation about family, nationality and everything in between.\u201cBy the time we got through talking about all the relatives on both sides, it was time to go home,\u201d jokes Paddy. \u201cBut we did squeeze in a few words about travels here and there.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ve both done a lot of traveling in our time,\u201d adds his wife Hazel. \u201cWe compared stories of travels around the world.\u201dFor the remaining two weeks of the cruise, the two long lost cousins and their spouses were inseparable.\u201cWe met every day on the cruise after that, and got to know each other,\u201d recalls Hazel. \u201cWe had drinks before and after dinner every night.\u201dAt the time, the foursome were all in their 60s and 70s and there was, as Paddy puts it, \u201can awful lot of water under the bridge\u201d to fill in.It turned out both couples had sons living in Boston. They all, especially Paddy and Gerard, enjoy debating history, religion and politics. All four love travel. Already plans started brewing for future family get-togethers.When the cruise ended, the McEvoys and the Monaghans exchanged contact details, promising to stay in touch.Paddy and Hazel happened to be heading to the US later that year to visit their son. When, in one of many post-cruise email exchanges, they mentioned the upcoming trip to Eileen and Gerard, the Americans immediately invited their Irish relatives to visit them in Connecticut.Paddy remembers his American daughter-in-law being especially wary about the whole situation.\u201cHow do you know these people? I feel like they\u2019re about to take you to their basement, never to be seen again,\u201d he recalls her saying, only half-jokingly.As such, it was pretty hilarious when Paddy and Hazel arrived at Eileen and Gerard\u2019s Connecticut home only to be enthusiastically shown around the American couple\u2019s basement conversion.But the visit went off without a hitch, and the connection made on the cruise seemed only more solid on the ground.Eileen and Gerard returned the visit later in the year. It was so special for Eileen to once again be welcomed by an Irish cousin, cup of tea in hand.From there, as Hazel puts it, \u201ca great friendship developed.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ve been friends ever since and we visit across the Atlantic regularly now to see one another,\u201d she says.There have been adventures in Ireland, trips to Eileen and Gerard\u2019s second home in Vermont and group vacations \u2013 and their Boston-based sons enjoy meeting up too.Eileen has also met a whole host of other Irish family members through Paddy. She tells him today that he \u201cbrightened her future\u201d by opening a door she\u2019d thought forever closed following Nora\u2019s passing.How an Airbnb disaster led to a beautiful friendshipToday, the cousins like to imagine Nora \u201claughing her head off\u201d at the idea of Eileen and Gerard meeting and becoming close thanks to the unlikely combination of a cruise ship, an elevator and an overheard conversation.Due to the pandemic, it\u2019s been almost four years since the McEvoys and the Monaghans have met in person, but the two couples are set to finally reunite this summer.They\u2019re counting down the days, and in the meantime the foursome have stayed in touch via lively video call and long emails.Last year, Eileen\u2019s brother passed away, and she says Paddy and Hazel\u2019s letters and emails \u201chelped so much\u201d during that tough period.\u201cIt really means the world that we\u2019ve met these people, how lucky we are to meet them,\u201d says Eileen.Hazel summarizes their story with the following words: \u201cfun and friendship and family.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll go with those three and add \u2018fascinating\u2019,\u201d says Gerard.Over the years, Eileen and Paddy have analyzed their family trees more than a few times, trying to work out exactly what their relationship is \u2013 they\u2019re connected through marriage, and through their respective grandmothers.\u201cI think it makes us fifth cousins or something,\u201d guesses Eileen.\u201cOh no,\u201d says Paddy. \u201cWe\u2019re much more than that. We\u2019re friends.\u201d"

        "text": "Bo Knapp never forgot the first moment he first saw Beverly Scott. It was August 1968, day one of eighth grade and Beverly was a transfer student at Henderson Junior High in Little Rock, Arkansas. Bo and his best friend were standing in the school hallway when they met Beverly.\u201cOur hallways in this school, they were outside, and so there\u2019s this beam of sunlight shining down on her,\u201d recalls Bo. \u201cShe had a Black Watch plaid dress on, and she had really beautiful red hair, and she\u2019s standing there and she saw us coming, and she turned and smiled.\u201dBo had only moved to Little Rock the year before, so he and Beverly bonded over both being new in town. And it turned out Bo and Beverly lived just half a mile from each other. A friendship between the two 14-year-olds quickly developed.\u201cWe got to know each other, and we started going steady,\u201d Beverly tellsAs a sign of their commitment, Bo gave Beverly an ID bracelet with his name on and she never took it off. And over the next couple of months, they had a sweet, brief courtship. After curfew, Bo would sneak into Beverly\u2019s yard to steal a few extra moments with her.\u201cI\u2019d say, \u2018Come to my window and I\u2019ll talk to you through the window,\u2019\u201d recalls Beverly.\u201cOne day, it was like 10 o\u2019clock at night and I wanted to talk to her, so I went around and knocked on her window, and her dad caught me,\u201d recalls Bo. \u201cThat might have been the end.\u201dThe relationship dwindled from there, but Bo and Beverly remained friends throughout junior high. Bo\u2019s best friend even dated Beverly for two years (\u201cvery long for that time period,\u201d adds Bo.)\u201cThen we went our separate ways,\u201d recalls Beverly. \u201cBut we always knew how each other was getting on, and who they were dating \u2013 we went on to go to the same high school and college.\u201dBut after university, the two lost touch completely. Beverly stayed in Arkansas and got married. Bo lived all over \u2013 from Texas to Tokyo \u2013 before settling in South Carolina and also getting married.Years, then decades passed. By the mid-2000s, Bo and Beverly were back on the peripheries of one another\u2019s lives thanks to social media. But they lived hundreds of miles from one another, and were both dealing with some tough circumstances \u2013 Bo went through a divorce, while Beverly\u2019s husband passed away.Cut to 2013. Bo had been divorced for almost a decade and Beverly was a widow of three years. The former flames, now both 60, received invites to their 40th high school reunion, taking place at the Clinton Presidential Library in Little Rock.Both Bo and Beverly had attended previous school reunions, but with their partners in tow, and they\u2019d never talked much to one another. This time round, they were each attending alone, and over the course of the evening, they found themselves often in one another\u2019s orbit. They didn\u2019t talk much one-on-one, but were often in the same group conversations.At some point in the evening, Bo told Beverly and his other former classmates about his love of sailing \u2013 he\u2019d recently got his license and enjoyed getting out on the water whenever he could.His old friends were enraptured by Bo\u2019s sailing stories and a plan started developing \u2013 Bo would charter a large catamaran so the old school gang could head out on a 40th anniversary sailing trip.That night, Bo recalls thinking Beverly was \u201cfun and beautiful,\u201d just like he recalled her being back in the day. He was excited that she seemed interested in the sailing trip, but he didn\u2019t think anything romantic would happen between them.\u201cI always had a favorable impression of her \u2013 and asked her on the trip as a friend,\u201d he says.As for Beverly, when she told her friends and family she was going on vacation with a bunch of people she hadn\u2019t hung out with since she was 17, they were skeptical.\u201cThey thought I was crazy,\u201d she recalls.But Beverly was excited about the trip.\u201cI\u2019m pretty adventurous,\u201d she says. \u201cLove all things on the water! And I felt very secure and comfortable going with such great people I had known most all my life, even though I had not seen or kept in close contact with them.\u201dHer only concern was that the group might not have the same camaraderie they\u2019d had as teenagers. But she needn\u2019t have worried, the trip was great fun from day one.As the catamaran sailed around the Caribbean, stopping off at sandy beaches and ocean view restaurants, Bo and Beverly found themselves increasingly drawn to one another.\u201cNothing really happened on the trip,\u201d says Bo. \u201cExcept I noticed she was perfect: cheerful, self reliant, capable, fearless.\u201d\u201cWe had a chemistry \u2013 that was kind of undeniable, honestly,\u201d says Beverly. But at the time, she wasn\u2019t sure if she was ready to date again \u2013 whenever friends back home suggested setting her up, she\u2019d always bow out. She was nervous about the idea, and hated the idea of dating feeling forced.One evening, the catamaran stopped off at Bomba\u2019s Shack on Tortola, a spot in the British Virgin Islands known for its surfing and partying scene.It was \u201cliterally a shack of driftwood and washed up lumber slapped together haphazardly on a remote beach,\u201d recalls Bo.When Bo and Beverly\u2019s group arrived, a full moon party was in full swing, a live band playing and revelers drinking, dancing and celebrating.The old friends stayed out into the early hours of the morning. Then something unexpected happened.\u201cWe were dancing and he kind of kissed me,\u201d recalls Beverly. \u201cWe call it the \u2018accidental kiss.\u2019\u201dIt was, says Beverly, \u201cvery unexpected, short and sweet and made my heart skip a beat or two.\u201dThe next day Bo sent Beverly an email, apologizing. \u201cI\u2019m sorry about the kiss,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean for that to happen. But I might like another one.\u201dWhen the message popped up on Beverly\u2019s phone, she didn\u2019t know what to do \u2013 she felt the same way, but she didn\u2019t want to risk making things awkward by disrupting the group dynamic on the ship. Beverly decided to ignore the message, pretending she hadn\u2019t seen it under the guise of not checking her inbox on vacation.But when the sailing trip came to an end and Beverly and Bo returned to their home towns some 600 miles apart, Beverly finally replied. From there, the two started messaging back and forth.These emails got deep quickly, as Bo got frank about his views on life, travel and everything in between. He was curious to learn more about Beverly, \u201cto see if we were aligned,\u201d as he puts it.It was soon obvious they were.\u201cBeverly said she lived by putting energy and focus on five Fs: Faith, Family, Friends, Fun, Fitness,\u201d says Bo. \u201cThese were exactly my priorities as well.\u201dIn one of his emails, Bo wrote that he\u2019d never thought about getting married again, but he was starting to consider the prospect.\u201cWhy don\u2019t we have a date before we talk about the rest of our lives?\u201d wrote Beverly in response.They fell in love in the 1980s but married other people. 23 years later they reconnectedBo arranged to travel to Little Rock to meet Beverly for a lunch date. Somehow, Beverly\u2019s mother, uncle, sister, brother-in-law and niece ended up inviting themselves along \u2013 and then Beverly\u2019s adult kids found out and wanted to come too. All Beverly\u2019s family members were keen to suss Bo out, and no one wanted to miss the occasion.That morning, Beverly picked Bo up from the airport and filled him in on the extra attendees.\u201cSo we might want to stop by the Capital Hotel bar and have a quick drink before we go,\u201d she told him.Lunch was a baptism of fire, a \u201cfirst date with like 10 people,\u201d as Bo puts it. But Beverly\u2019s family were fun and welcoming, and quickly assured of Bo\u2019s good intentions.\u201cHe was thrown into the whole family pretty quickly,\u201d says Beverly.As for Beverly\u2019s friends, they were initially a bit concerned, especially when Beverly started talking about moving to North Carolina to be with Bo.\u201cThey\u2019d become pretty protective of me because of being a widow in the group and all of my friends\u2019 husbands kind of took me under their wings,\u201d says Beverly.But once Beverly\u2019s core group met Bo, and decided he was a good guy, they were happy and excited for her.\u201cNow they\u2019re all good friends,\u201d says Beverly.Bo was initially worried his best friend, the one who\u2019d dated Beverly after he did, back in the late 1960s, might not take the news so well. But this friend, while joking that Beverly had broken his heart back in the day, said he was delighted for his old pals and their unexpected happiness.In fact, all the old middle school crew were \u201cthrilled that we both found each other and were so well suited,\u201d says Bo.After they had their loved ones blessings, Bo and Beverly became serious quickly.\u201cWhen you know, you know,\u201d says Beverly.Plus, after losing her first husband, Beverly was keenly aware of how fickle and how short life can be. She didn\u2019t want to waste a moment \u2013 and Bo was on the same page.\u201cWe were like, \u2018We\u2019ve got to get this show on the road, we don\u2019t have much time,\u2019\u201d says Beverly. \u201cSo we\u2019ve made the most out of every single second.\u201dThey met while hiking and fell in love. Two months later she was diagnosed with cancerTravel became a cornerstone of Bo and Beverly\u2019s relationship. Their first trip together as a couple was to watch the Rolling Stones play a gig in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.And then in 2015, on a trip to Paris, Bo proposed to Beverly at the top of the Eiffel Tower.They were on the top level, by the cafe, and had just spotted some hired photographers taking pictures of the visitors, framed against the panoramic views.\u201cI said, \u2018Let\u2019s get our photo taken,\u2019\u201d recalls Bo. \u201cSo I went and grabbed a photographer, and the photographer came, and then I kneeled.\u201d\u201cI said, \u2018Bo, they\u2019re taking our picture, get up! What are you doing down there?\u2019\u201d recalls Beverly, laughing.But once she realized what was happening, Beverly said yes, overjoyed.The two started planning a wedding, looking at how they could bring all their family together for the occasion, but they soon switched gears.\u201cWe finally look at each other and go, \u2018Let\u2019s just do something for ourselves.\u2019 We came back and had a big party \u2013 but we decided to just run away and get married,\u201d says Beverly.The couple eloped on Turtle Island in Fiji. It\u2019s a day that Beverly remembers as simply \u201creally cool.\u201dSince then, Bo and Beverly have embarked on at least one cycling trip and one sailing trip each year, often with various groups of friends in tow. They also love traveling with their kids and grandkids.\u201cWe want to do as much as possible while we are still able,\u201d says Bo.\u201cBeverly is 10 times more adventurous than the average person so she makes our lives so exciting,\u201d he adds. \u201cAt our age a lot of our friends are content to sit on the couch. She has too much life force in her to sit still.\u201dShe flew to New York and met her future fianc\u00e9eToday, looking back on their middle school romance, their decades apart and their unexpected reunion is a moving and gratifying experience for Bo and Beverly.Beverly thinks their 14-year-old selves \u201cwould be so happy for us and proud of us.\u201d\u201cWe both have gone through so much and have such a deep appreciation and love for each other and our life together,\u201d says Beverly, adding she\u2019s so grateful to have had \u201ctwo soulmates in my lifetime, which is unheard of.\u201dThis summer, Bo and Beverly will be heading to their 50th high school reunion. This time, they\u2019ll be rocking up hand in hand.\u201cIt seems like yesterday we graduated high school,\u201d says Bo. \u201cLife flies, it doesn\u2019t seem like it sometimes, especially when you\u2019re younger \u2013 but don\u2019t waste time. Don\u2019t worry about the little stuff and enjoy every moment. If you wake up, it\u2019s a good day, right?\u201d\u201cEnjoy every moment,\u201d agrees Beverly. \u201cWe are.\u201d"

        "text": "Patricia Salazar first saw Aaron Toro running along the breathtaking Peekaboo Trail in Bryce Canyon National Park in Utah.Patricia was also tackling the trail, alongside two friendly women she\u2019d just met. The July sun was blazing down and the surrounding copper rocks were bathed in a warm light.The Peekaboo Trail is one of the most strenuous in Bryce Canyon. Patricia\u2019s a hardcore runner and extreme sports enthusiast, but even she was finding it tough-going \u2013 so the fact that Aaron was running up the mountain like it was nothing was pretty impressive. Patricia couldn\u2019t help but comment on his speed.\u201cAre you trying to be the fastest on the trail?\u201d Patricia shouted at the stranger as he whizzed past.Aaron stopped running, caught his breath, and smiled at Patricia. He brushed off the compliment, said a friendly hello, and offered to take a photo of Patricia and her new friends. The women thanked him, then he was off again, running into the distance. Patricia watched him go.\u201cI\u2019m like, \u2018Oh my God, he looks like a Hemsworth brother.\u2019 He was tan and buff, with blond hair. And so I was like, \u2018Gosh, what a hunk. That\u2019ll be a good story for later.\u2019\u201dPatricia assumed she\u2019d never see the runner again. But then, mere minutes later, she spotted him on another bend in the trail.\u201cThe girls were like, \u2018Oh, my God, there he is, there he is.\u2019 And again, I had nothing to lose, nothing to gain \u2013 at least so I thought. And so I just hollered at him, \u2018Hey, are you single?\u2019\u201dAaron stopped, turned around, and grinned.\u201cYeah,\u201d he said. \u201cSingle as a one dollar bill.\u201d\u201cAt that point, in my mind I was like, \u2018Oh, no, what\u2019s my follow-up?\u2019\u201d recalls Patricia.\u201cDo you want my number?\u201d Patricia asked Aaron, spontaneously.\u201cAre you from here?\u201d said Aaron in response.\u201cNo,\u201d replied Patricia. \u201cDoes it matter?\u201d\u201cNo, I guess not,\u201d shrugged Aaron.And so they exchanged names and numbers. Patricia told Aaron she was from California, and in town for a vacation. Aaron said he was based in Virginia at the time.Patricia saved Aaron in her cell phone as \u201cTrail Aaron.\u201d\u201cI said, \u2018Okay, I\u2019ll text you,\u2019\u201d recalls Patricia. \u201cNever thinking that I would hear from him or we would connect. And he went on his merry way and kept running.\u201dIt was the summer of 2021. Patricia was 31 and enjoying what felt like a gradual return to \u201cnormal\u201d following the height of the Covid-19 pandemic.\u201cI was single, living by myself, and I had been an endurance athlete for a few years,\u201d Patricia tellstoday.Patricia had never had much luck with dating apps. And meeting people in person in the Covid era felt pretty much impossible. That summer, she was feeling excited about the future and the opportunity to pursue her goals and dreams alone.\u201cI was just going to be the single endurance athlete. I loved cycling, I loved running, and that was just going to fulfill me enough, and that was great,\u201d she says.Patricia had also made a pact with herself: Each year, she\u2019d take a solo trip somewhere to escape from the pressures of work and indulge her hobbies and passions. In summer 2021, with international travel still largely off the table, Patricia picked Utah as her destination. The state was home to some beautiful national parks, perfect for trail running. That July, Patricia drove to Utah from her home in California.\u201cThat\u2019s kind of where I was in life, just exploring on my own and being so happy to be in the driver\u2019s seat \u2013 not only of my road trip, but of my life,\u201d she says.When he met Patricia, Aaron was in his late twenties. Like Patricia, Aaron was in a place in his life where he was focusing on himself, rather than dating. He was in the middle of a contract with the US Navy and had found being active-duty military didn\u2019t lend itself to meeting prospective partners.\u201cWe\u2019re constantly traveling and moving and you\u2019re all over the place all the time,\u201d says Aaron.He spent his down time enjoying endurance sports.\u201cI started training really hard. And I would devote all my time, essentially, to that \u2013 and I was okay with that,\u201d he recalls.In July 2021, Aaron was in his home state of Utah to catch up with his parents and sisters and to enjoy some quality time with loved ones before he started his next deployment.\u201cGoing out to Utah, a week before I leave the country for six months \u2013 the last thing on my mind was meeting someone,\u201d he says.But Aaron was smitten with Patricia from the moment she\u2019d unexpectedly hollered at him on the trail. He was delighted when she asked for his number.\u201cI left thinking, \u2018Wow, she\u2019s spectacular. Probably never hear from her ever again in my life.\u2019 Because, you know, stuff like this doesn\u2019t happen. So I\u2019m like, \u2018Oh, well, that was nice of her. But she\u2019s probably just goofing with her friends. And I\u2019ll probably never see her again.\u2019\u201dAaron kept running around Bryce Canyon, and eventually reunited with his family, who\u2019d opted for a more leisurely hike. But as the group were leaving the park, Aaron saw Patricia again \u2013 now on her own, having bid farewell to the women she met earlier. Patricia said hi to Aaron and his family as she ran past.\u201cOne sec, I\u2019ll catch up with you,\u201d Aaron told his parents, and, without really thinking, he decided to try to speak with Patricia again.When he caught up with her \u2013 not easy, says Aaron, she\u2019s super fast \u2013 Aaron asked if Patricia would like to walk the last half-mile together.\u201cWe started talking,\u201d recalls Aaron, \u201cAnd it was a really good conversation. We both happened to be training for similar races at the same time. Obviously, she seems really cool. She\u2019s way out of my league, so I was pretty surprised she was talking to me.\u201dOver the course of the conversation, Patricia and Aaron discovered they were both keen to run one of Bryce Canyon\u2019s most famous trails \u2013 the beautiful Fairyland Loop \u2013 and agreed to meet the following morning to give it a go together.\u201cI felt like he could really be the adventure buddy I never thought I needed, but after meeting him, knew I wanted,\u201d says Patricia.From there, Patricia and Aaron went their separate ways. Patricia cycled back to her Airbnb, where she showered, put her feet up, and was just wondering where she could go for a drink and a bite to eat, when a text from \u201cTrail Aaron\u201d popped up on her phone.Aaron and his family were hanging out at his uncle\u2019s house that evening. He wondering if Patricia fancied joining for brisket?\u201cAt that point, I\u2019d eaten bar food and Clif bars for about a week and a half on the roads, I was like, \u2018Oh, yeah, home-cooked meal, for sure,\u201d recalls Patricia.\u201cThat actually sounds amazing,\u201d Patricia typed in response. \u201cCount me in!\u201dWhen Aaron sent the invite, he just figured he had \u201cnothing to lose.\u201d He really liked Patricia, and when she said she was up for coming round, he was thrilled.He put down his phone and tracked down his family, who were preparing food in his uncle\u2019s kitchen.\u201cHey guys, so you know that girl in the green shorts that ran by earlier? Well, she\u2019s coming over,\u201d he said.\u201cWait, do you even know her?\u201d asked his family, confused.But Patricia fit in right away. It was like she and Aaron had known one another for years, not for mere hours.\u201cI spent the whole night just meeting his family and playing pickleball and cornhole,\u201d says Patricia. \u201cI think his family was a little shocked, but it was an awesome night.\u201d\u201cThey\u2019re great people,\u201d says Aaron. \u201cSo they were more than welcoming.\u201d\u201cWhen I got to the house and started talking to his family, I was like, \u2018Oh, man, he checks all the dream boxes \u2013 comes from an amazing family, is in between two girls, has two sisters, his mom is his best friend, loves to hike, loves to bike\u2026\u2019\u201d says Patricia.Hours later, Patricia and Aaron were sitting out in the backyard together, chatting.\u201cHe reached over and he held my hand,\u201d recalls Patricia. \u201cThe moment he held my hand, I knew I was going to fall in love with him.\u201dAaron felt the same way.\u201cThere\u2019s just something about her, she was so gorgeous. We had so much fun just hanging out, we connected on so many levels and we were just best friends right off the bat,\u201d he says.\u201cAnd I don\u2019t know why, but something just clicked in my brain that day and that night where it was like \u2013 she\u2019s worth the risk. Seeing how she interacted with my family\u2026 Like I said, it was just like, \u2018Wow, there\u2019s something special here.\u2019\u201dShe went hiking in the woods and met the love of her lifeThe next day, Aaron and Patricia ran the Fairyland Loop together. From there, Patricia was planning to head to Utah\u2019s Park City to tackle more trails. She asked Aaron if he wanted to join her.It was only then, when they were in the car en route, that Aaron mentioned he was in the military and was heading off on a six-month deployment in twelve days\u2019 time.When Aaron met potential partners, he never led with the fact he was in active service \u2013 he knew it wasn\u2019t always an attractive prospect, given the inevitable long distance.Patricia had never met anyone in the military. She wasn\u2019t sure what to think. But she knew Aaron made her feel safe and excited for the future. She decided this news didn\u2019t change anything.When they stopped for gas, Patricia texted her best friend, \u201cI met the man I\u2019m going to marry on a trail,\u201d she said.\u201cNo you didn\u2019t,\u201d replied her friend.\u201cWe drove for hours together, we\u2019re staying in an Airbnb together,\u201d said Patricia.For her friend, this message was less exciting and more terrifying, setting off several alarm bells.\u201cOkay, well you need to send me your location,\u201d she wrote back. \u201cWe\u2019ve all heard this story before on whatever news network.\u201dAfter concluding her Utah trip, Patricia was planning to drive back to California, visiting family en route. Knowing that Aaron would be leaving the country within days, she decided to take a leap.\u201cHey, I don\u2019t want to waste any time,\u201d she said. \u201cWhy don\u2019t we just go together, and you can meet my family?\u201dAaron said sure \u2013 she\u2019d already met his family, after all \u2013 so Patricia rang her mom to tell her she was bringing along a plus one.\u201cI met this guy on a trail, I really like him,\u201d she said. \u201cI think this is it.\u201d\u201cWait, who is he?\u201d asked Patricia\u2019s mother, confused.\u201cI think I\u2019m falling in love,\u201d said Patricia. \u201cThis is crazy.\u201dEn route to Patricia\u2019s parents\u2019 house, Patricia and Aaron stopped over in Salt Lake City. They stayed up into the early hours, talking.\u201cIt was the night in Salt Lake that we decided to really go all in,\u201d says Patricia. \u201cWe had a lot of serious conversations right off the bat \u2013 where we were financially, what our aspirations were, where we were politically, what our relationships with our family were like, and what we really wanted out of life if we were going to have another serious relationship.\u201dAaron says it was clear the two were aligned, and also ready to meet each other where they were at.\u201cWe were both very much on our own path, and we were both taking our lives and our careers very seriously,\u201d he says. \u201cSo we just laid that all out on the table for each other. We both said, \u2018If I do a relationship again, it\u2019s for real, it\u2019s not just dating around for fun.\u2019\u201dTheir talks were sometimes \u201cheavy,\u201d he adds.\u201cI think we were both at that same mental place, and we were both mature enough to just put that all out on the table.\u201dThe two came up with a \u201cfive-year plan right off the bat,\u201d as Aaron puts it. He knew he didn\u2019t want to stay in the military indefinitely, for example, and both he and Patricia were keen to get married, but liked the idea of an elopement over a big wedding.They\u2019d covered almost everything when Patricia suddenly realized she\u2019d forgotten to check just how long Aaron\u2019s deployment would last.He explained it would be six months, and he\u2019d mostly be stationed in Spain.Patricia had been expecting something way longer, and way further afield. Six months seemed doable.\u201cLet\u2019s do this thing,\u201d she said.The two became official there and then.\u201cWe had a pretty good foundation of what to expect out of each other, out of our relationship and out of our lives. So the rest was easy after that,\u201d says Aaron.\u201cWith that small hiccup in the middle,\u201d says Patricia. \u201cThat whole cancer thing.\u201dShe fell in love with a podcast host and flew across the world to meet herFor the first few months, Patricia and Aaron found long distance relatively easy. They FaceTimed every day, enjoying more long, deep chats. Within weeks, they told one another they were falling in love. Patricia booked a trip to Spain for September. Their leap of faith back in July seemed to be paying off.\u201cIt was really manageable \u2013 we felt very lucky how successfully we navigated long distance,\u201d says Patricia.Then fall came, and Patricia had an abnormal pap smear result. She didn\u2019t think too much about it. She went on the planned trip to visit Aaron in Spain. Back in the US, Patricia\u2019s doctor booked her in for a colposcopy. She kept Aaron in the loop.\u201cI wasn\u2019t worried about it,\u201d says Patricia. \u201cI think in the back of his mind, he was a little more worried than I was.\u201dThen the results came through: Patricia had stage two cervical cancer.She wanted to tell Aaron the news on FaceTime rather than via text. By then, he was based somewhere in Africa.\u201cI remember just waiting up late that night for him to wake up to tell him,\u201d says Patricia.She was in a state of shock. How could she tell this man she was falling for more and more each day, who was currently hundreds of miles away across oceans, that she had a crushing diagnosis and uncertain future?\u201cI sat in the living room, and FaceTimed him, and I said, \u2018This is my diagnosis,\u201d recalls Patricia.In one of their deep conversations in Salt Lake City, both Patricia and Aaron had expressed a desire to have kids. Now, Patricia\u2019s doctor had said it was unlikely she\u2019d be able to have biological children. And the journey to recovery was set to be long, complicated and uncertain.\u201cIf this isn\u2019t the path that you want to walk on with me, I completely understand,\u201d Patricia told Aaron that night. \u201cI love you, you love me. And so it\u2019s been fun, but I\u2019m not going to make that choice for you.\u201dAaron jumped in right away.\u201cNo, I want you forever more than I want anything else,\u201d he said.\u201cI wanted to reach through the phone, \u2018What are you talking about?\u2019\u201d recalls Aaron today. \u201cWe\u2019re in this for the long-haul, no matter what, cancer\u2019s not going to get in the way of that, it\u2019s just one more thing.\u201dSo Aaron said all the right things, and did his best to comfort Patricia from afar. But he was horribly aware of the distance. And the creeping fear.\u201cThere\u2019s nothing I could do other than just try to comfort her through a phone,\u201d he says today.Over the next few months, Patricia had another biopsy, to determine the cancer hadn\u2019t spread, and started fertility treatment, as she still hoped to have biological children one day. Aaron supported her throughout and was always there, even if he couldn\u2019t be physically there.\u201cHe was there every day for me and, I kid you not, there were nights that I cried myself to sleep with him on the phone, on FaceTime,\u201d says Patricia.\u201cI hated to Google what the doctors were sending me and so he would Google for me and be like, \u2018Don\u2019t Google that.\u2019\u201dThings \u201cgot worse before it got better,\u201d as Aaron puts it.At first, it seemed like a dose of radiation could target Patricia\u2019s cancer. Then doctors started discussing surgery and concluded Patricia needed a hysterectomy. This would be an invasive procedure with significant recovery time.Aaron was granted emergency leave to go home to the US to support Patricia in person in the weeks before, during and after the surgery. He\u2019s eternally grateful for this.In late 2021, Covid-related rules still restricted Californian hospital visitors. But whenever he was permitted to be in the building, Aaron was by Patricia\u2019s side.\u201cThat was a huge, I guess, strength-builder in our relationship,\u201d says Patricia of this period. \u201cI didn\u2019t know if we could get stronger than we already were. And then that happened.\u201dWhile Patricia was in hospital, Aaron met Patricia\u2019s grandparents, who she\u2019s very close with, for the first time. Patricia\u2019s grandmother immediately took Aaron aside.\u201cHer grandma takes me into the other room. And she gives me Trisha\u2019s great-grandma\u2019s engagement ring, which is a family heirloom ring,\u201d recalls Aaron. \u201cShe\u2019s like, \u2018This is for when you ask Trish to marry her.\u2019\u201dAaron remembers sitting in his car in the hospital parking lot, turning the beautiful ring over in his hands.\u201cI had the family ring, and I was literally just sitting there for hours outside the hospital in the rain,\u201d he says, getting emotional at the memory. \u201cI knew as soon as she came out of hospital that I was going to ask her to marry me.\u201dOn Christmas Eve 2021, Aaron proposed to Patricia.\u201cI was laying on the couch. We were in matching Christmas onesies,\u201d recalls Patricia. \u201cAnd on Christmas Eve, my family usually lets us open one Christmas present. So I said, \u2018Let\u2019s keep that tradition going, let\u2019s open one Christmas present.\u2019\u201dShe gave Aaron a pair of slippers. Then he got down on one knee and asked her to marry him, presenting her with the family ring.\u201cI could barely move, nine days after my surgery. But I jumped up off of that couch so fast to say yes,\u201d recalls Patricia. \u201cIt was very exciting, and our families were so thrilled for us.\u201dOver the first half of 2022, Patricia continued to recover from surgery and went through five weeks of radiation.\u201cI knew there was a finish line and Aaron would be waiting at it, so I took it day by day,\u201d she says.Then, in September 2022, Patricia and Aaron got married. As they\u2019d always planned, they eloped. The ceremony took place amid the red rocks in Snow Canyon, Utah, not far from where their relationship first began.\u201cIt was exactly what we wanted,\u201d says Patricia, who took Aaron\u2019s name, becoming Patricia Toro. \u201cWe left out of our vows, \u2018through sickness and health,\u2019 because we\u2019ve already gone through that, we know we can accomplish that.\u201dThey fell in love in Mexico in 1981. Four months later she was diagnosed with cancerFast forward to today, and Aaron\u2019s finishing up his final navy deployment and Patricia\u2019s in remission. The couple are looking forward to the future.\u201cThe sky\u2019s the limit. We\u2019re not 100% sure where we\u2019re going to end up but we have a few plans in place, and it\u2019s all looking up from here,\u201d says Aaron.It\u2019s not even two years ago that Patricia and Aaron first met, but the two feel like they\u2019ve crammed a lifetime of ups and downs into their relationship so far.It\u2019s surreal to think about, especially when they consider the slim chances of them meeting in the first place.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t feel real, it feels like we\u2019re living in a simulation, because it\u2019s just ridiculous,\u201d says Aaron. \u201cWe live on opposite coasts, we both happen to be in Utah, in the same National Park, same day.\u201d\u201cI am not a super-religious person, and neither is Aaron. But we both feel that there was something that put us on that trail that day,\u201d says Patricia. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t know if that something knew the struggles that I was going to go through three months later. Or if they knew that he\u2019s going to need me in his life at one point. But we were there for a reason that day. And I know that my journey these last 17 months would have been a lot different had Aaron not been there.\u201d"

        "name": "10 years after Rana Plaza, is Bangladesh's garment industry any safer?",
        "link": "https://edition.cnn.com/style/article/rana-plaza-garment-worker-rights-accord/index.html",
        "text": "Written byTrade union leader Babul Akhter was working at Bangladesh's labor ministry in Dhaka on the morning that Rana Plaza, a nine-story building crammed with garment factories, collapsed. He rushed to the scene in Savar district, around 20 miles outside the capital. There he heard the cries of trapped workers emanating from the rubble \u2014 a muffled cacophony he recalls sounding like the buzz of honeybees.\"We realized how helpless they were ... and we were also helpless (in) that we couldn't do anything for them,\" said Akhter, who is secretary general of the Bangladesh Garments & Industrial Workers Federation (BGIWF). He spoke via a translator in a group interview with CNN and other media outlets.Monday marks 10 years since history's deadliest garment factory disaster. More than 1,100 people, mostly women, were killed. Over 2,500 others were injured. While businesses in the building's lower floors had immediately closed when structural cracks were discovered a day earlier, thousands of factory workers were forced \u2014 eitherdirectly by their superiors, or indirectly by the pressure to earn a day's wage \u2014 to return on the day of the collapse, despite many of them raising concerns.\"The workers did not have any say because they were working for minimum wage ... and they were not even unionized,\" Akhter said. \"So, they couldn't collectively raise the issue (of not returning to work).\"A woman grieves before a poster of her family member on the wall of a school turned into a make-shift morgue on April 30, 2013, following the Rana Plaza collapse in in Savar, near Dhaka, Bangladesh.The collapse was triggered by vibrations from diesel generators switched on following a power outage. But subsequent investigations revealed a long catalog of failures, oversights and \u2014 according to organizations like the global nonprofitTransparency International\u2014 corruption at practically every stage of the seven-year-old building's life.Rana Plaza collapsed because substandard materials were used to build on the site of a filled-in pond, and because extra floors were added to expand the structure beyond its authorized design. It collapsed because authorities had permitted the building, originally planned for commercial purposes, to be converted to industrial use and additionally occupied by five garment factories. It collapsed because earlier audits were inadequate; warnings were ignored or dismissed.Too often, workers speak loudest from the graveIn 2016, 38 people were charged with murder over the tragedy, including factory owners and government officials, though some of these individuals have since died or had their charges dropped. Rana Plaza's owner, Sohel Rana, remains in custody as part of a lengthy ongoing trial. He has, in the meantime, been convicted on separate corruption charges.But the search for accountability went far beyond individuals \u2014 and stretched beyond Bangladesh's borders. Factories in Rana Plaza produced garments for the likes of Italian retailer Bennetton and British fast fashion brand Primark. As such, the disaster held a mirror up to the developed world, namelyconsumers hungry for cheap clothingand Western brands using low-cost production to meet demand.Like fast fashion, 'fast furniture' is a problem for our planetIn the collapse's aftermath, numerous labels sourcing from Bangladesh vocally committed to improving worker safety in the country. So, a decade on, are the clothing factories that now account for84% of the country's exportsany safer?The events of April 24, 2013 triggered swift \u2014 and yet, still belated \u2014 action from Bangladeshi authorities. Almost 20 garment factories were shuttered within two weeks of the disaster. But it was clear, as it had been before the collapse, that safety issues were endemic. Six months earlier, a major fire at the Tazreen Fashions factory outside Dhaka had claimed at least 117 lives; seven years before that, in 2005, the nine-story Spectrum factory had collapsed, killing 64 people.Fast-forward to today, and major garment factory disasters \u2014 of that scale, at least \u2014 have seemingly been avoided. This is often credited to a groundbreaking agreement reached between brands, factories and trade unions less than a month after Rana Plaza:the Accord on Fire and Building Safety in Bangladesh.Reatives of Bangladeshi workers who lost their lives in the Rana Plaza collapse gather with banners and placards in Savar on June 29, 2013, at the site of Bangladesh's worst industrial disaster.Signed at the timeby over 200 brands, and applicable to any Bangladeshi factory or workshop supplying them with garments, the legally binding commitment established an independent inspection program spanning fire, electrical and building safety. Inspection findings are made publicly available. So too are improvement plans for underperforming factories, with corrective action implemented using funds committed by participating brands. The Accord has also introduced safety committees andcomplaint mechanismsvia which workers can raise concerns \u2014 anonymously if they so wish.Such are its successes that a Pakistani version of the Accord was announced last year and has been signed by49 brands and retailers, including Zara's parent company Inditex.Asian rivers are turning black. And our colorful closets are to blameThis is not to say Bangladesh's garment industry has been incident-free. The International Labor Organization reported that, between Rana Plaza's collapse and 2018, at least 35 further accidents in clothing factories had resulted in 27 deaths. Among them was a boiler explosion thatkilled 10in 2017. (The Accord's inspection process was expanded to include boiler monitoring shortly after).To date, however, over 30,000 factory inspections have taken place under the agreement, with over 400 facilities completing what organizers call \"initial remediation.\" In 2021, the New York Timesreportedalmost 200 factories with poor safety standards had lost contracts following Accord investigations.Rescue workers search for victims amid the rubble of the Rana Plaza building in Savar, near Dhaka, Bangladesh on April 26, 2013.Christie Miedema of the Clean Clothes Campaign, a Netherlands-based nonprofit that served as one of the Accord's signatories, cites real \"success stories\" in recent years.\"We know of very clear examples where an actual collapse has been prevented because a factory owner didn't want to evacuate, but the Accord ordered them to do so until things were repaired,\" she said on a video call. \"We also know of examples where workers complained about safety ... and were dismissed, then the Accord stepped in and said 'No, you have to re-hire them because they can't be retaliated against for (raising) safety issues.\"\"It's very difficult to quantify how many lives the Accord has saved, because you can never know,\" she added. \"But it is definitely thousands.\"The Accord is not without its shortcomings. For one, the relative absence of North American labels among signatories was conspicuous, with many seemingly concerned about financial commitments and the risk that legally binding commitments might lead to costly lawsuits. While there were a handful of exceptions\u2014 such as PVH Corp., the parent company of Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein \u2014the likes of Wal-Mart, Gap, Target and Macy's did not join.These brands, and others, instead formed their own group called the Alliance for Bangladesh Worker Safety. It, too, organized inspections and safety initiatives at hundreds of Bangladeshi factories in its members' supply chains. And while the Alliance wascriticized for being less rigorousand binding than the Accord, it has claimed its own successes. Before concluding its five-year tenure, as planned, in 2018, the organization reported that 93% of faults identified were corrected, while 178 facilities were removed from its list of compliant factories. (Many of the members went on to form Nirapon, an organization that continues to work in Bangladesh to carry out what it calls \"the next phase\" of the Alliance's safety programs.)The mysterious Chinese fashion app that's as popular as AmazonEven putting aside the differences between these two rival initiatives, the absence of a collective response among Western brands was counterproductive, Miedema said, adding: \"There could have been a united best standard... (but the split) weakened the unity of the sector in responding to this tragedy.\"What's more, the two agreements still only covered around half of the country's thousands of garment factories. Many small manufacturers and subcontractors continued to operate outside their remits \u2014 as have factories used by Chinese and Korean brands, which were barely part of the conversation in 2013, according to Miedema.Initially lasting five years, the Accord was renewed in 2018 and then for another two years in 2021. Nazma Akter, a former child worker who founded the labor rights organization Awaj Foundation, called on more US companies to participate.\"Any brand that doesn't sign the Accord does not respect the workers and does not believe in freedom of association,\" she said, adding: \"Without mandatory human rights due diligence, there is no accountability, no transparency and no penalty or punishment for brands like (those using factories in) Rana Plaza.\"Bangladeshi garment workers face ruin as global brands ditch clothing contracts amid coronavirus pandemicGroups like the Clean Clothes Campaign are not only urging brands to renew the agreement again later this year, but to expand their commitments to cover wages, union rights and worker welfare, ranging from menstrual health to tacking gender-based violence. For Miedema, addressing these issues is as intrinsic to worker safety as structural or electrical complaints.\"We've seen progress in one very specific area that's very much connected to what happened at Rana Plaza \u2014 building safety \u2014 but not in these other areas,\" she added. \"If (Rana Plaza's) workers had a union, they might have resisted entering together. If they had wages that sustained them, then maybe the threat of losing a month's wages .... wouldn't have sounded so terrible.\"Garment workers in a sewing section of a Textile Mills Limited factory in Gazipur, Bangladesh on March 18, 2021.In 2013, amid the wave of protests and strikes immediately following the disaster, Bangladesh's government raised the minimum salary for garment workers from 3,000 to 5,300 taka (then $68) a month. Five years later, this sum rose again to 8,000 taka (then $95), though the global union IndustriALL is currently demanding a figure three times higher, saying that \"roaring inflation\" has left Bangladesh's factory workers \"struggling to make ends meet.\"And while wages have crept up since the disaster, they have been vastly outpaced by the growth of the garment industry. Clothing exports from Bangladesh, which is aspiring to become a middle-income country by 2031, jumped from $14.6 billion in 2011 to $33.1 billion in 2019, according to consultancy McKinsey.These terms will help you understand fashion's role in the climate crisisAkter, who began working in garment factories in the 1990s when she was just 11 years old, echoed the calls to look beyond the strictest definitions of worker safety.\"Our members now feel very empowered and confident when safety issues come about,\" she said, reflecting on the improvements since the Rana Plaza collapse. \"But we are fighting not only on safety issues \u2014 we are trying to establish that the Accord should look after working conditions and (tackle issues like) gender-based violence ... It's about empowering and ensuring workers' voices and union rights.\""

Get the latest news in aviation, food and drink, where to stay and other travel developments.He\u2019d spent years backpacking around the world, and Japanese traveler Daisuke Kajiyama was finally ready to return home to pursue his long-helddream of opening up a guesthouse.In 2011, Kajiyama arrived back in Japan with his Israeli partner Hila, who he met in Nepal, and the pair set about finding the perfect location for their future venture.However, there were a couple of major stumbling blocks in their way. To start with, Kajiyama had very little money to speak of after years of globetrotting around destinations like Korea, Taiwan, India, Nepal, Guatemala, Cuba and Canada.He also happened to have his heart set on a traditional Japanese house, typically known as kominkawhich are usually passed down over generations.\u201cI wanted to have a traditional house in the countryside,\u201d Kajiyama tells CNN Travel, explaining that he was determined to find two houses located next to each other, so that he and Hila could live in one, while the other would be a guesthouse that they\u2019d run together. \u201cI had a vision.\u201dThis US couple bought and renovated a 14th-century Italian homeWhen he was unable to find anything that met his requirements, Kajiyama decided to shift his search to include the growing number of abandoned homes in the country.As younger people ditch rural areas in pursuit of jobs in the city, Japan\u2019s countryside is becoming filled with \u201cghost\u201d houses, orAccording to the Japan Policy Forum, there were 61 million houses and 52 million households in Japan in 2013, and with the country\u2019s population expected to decline from 127 million to about, this number is likely to increase.Kajiyama was driving around Tamatori, a small village located in the Shizuoka prefecture, between Kyoto and Tokyo, surrounded by green tea plantations and rice fields, when he came across an elderly woman farming, and decided to approach her.\u201cI said \u2018Do you know if there are any empty houses around here?\u2019 And she just pointed,\u201d he recalls.He looked over at the area that she was signaling to and spotted two neglected houses side by side \u2013 a former green tea factory and an old farmer\u2019s home \u2013 located close to a river.Both properties had been uninhabited for at least seven years and needed a huge amount of work. Kajiyama asked the woman to contact the owner to find out if they\u2019d be interested in selling.\u201cThe owner said that no one could live there, as it was abandoned,\u201d he says. \u201cBut he didn\u2019t say \u2018no.\u2019 Everybody was always saying \u2018no.\u2019 But he didn\u2019t. So I felt there was a small chance.\u201dExpats buy Japanese country house for a song and get way more than they bargained forKajiyama returned to visit the houses around five times, before going to visit the owner himself to negotiate an agreement that would see him use the old green tree factory as a home, and convert the farmer\u2019s house into the guesthouse he\u2019d always envisioned.While he was keen to purchase both of the homes, he explains that the traditions around home ownership in Japan mean that he is unable to do so until it\u2019s passed down to the son of the current owner.\u201cThey said \u2018if you take all the responsibility yourself, you can take it.\u2019 So we made an agreement on paper,\u201d he says.Both he and Hila were aware that they had a lot of work ahead of them, but the couple, who married in 2013, were thrilled to be one step closer to having their own guesthouse in an ideal spot.\u201cIt\u2019s a very nice location,\u201d says Kajiyama. \u201cIt\u2019s close to the city, but it\u2019s really countryside. Also people still live here and go to work [in the city].\u201cThe house is also in front of the river, so when you go to sleep you can hear the sound of the water.\u201dAccording to Kajiyama, the process of clearing the house, which is around 90 years old, before beginning the renovation works was one of the hardest parts of the process, simply because there was so much stuff to sort through. However, he was able to repurpose some of the items.During the first year, he spent a lot of time connecting with locals, gaining knowledge about the home, and helping the local farmers with farming for the first year or so.Although he wasn\u2019t hugely experienced with renovation work, he had spent some time farming and completing building while he was backpacking, and had also taken odd jobs fixing peoples homes.He completed much of the work on the guesthouse himself, replacing the floors and adding in a toilet, which he says was a wedding present from his parents, at a cost of around $10,000.\u201cI\u2019m not really a professional,\u201d he says.\u201d I like to do carpentry and I enjoy creating things, but I have no experience in my background.\u201cFrom my several years of backpacking, I saw so many interesting buildings, so many houses of interesting shapes and I\u2019ve been collecting those in my brain.\u201dKajiyama was determined to keep the house as authentic as possible by using traditional materials.He saved money by collecting traditional wood from building companies who were in the process of breaking down traditional houses.\u201cThey need to spend the money to throw it away,\u201d he explains. \u201cBut for me, some of the stuff is like treasure. So I would go and take the material that I wanted.\u201cThe house is a very, very old style,\u201d he says. \u201cSo it wouldn\u2019t look nice if I brought in more modern materials. It\u2019s totally authentic.\u201dHe explains that very little work had previously been done to the house, which is quite unusual for a home built so many years ago.\u201cIt\u2019s totally authentic,\u201d he says. \u201cUsually, with traditional houses, some renovations are made to the walls, because the insulation is not so strong. So you lose the style.\u201dHe says he received some financial support from the government, which meant he was able to bring in a carpenter and also benefited from, which allows travelers to work in exchange for food and board, when he needed extra help.After doing some research into Japanese guesthouse permits, he discovered that one of the simplest ways to acquire one would be to register the property as an agriculture guesthouse.As the area is filled with bamboo forests, this seemed like a no-brainer, and Kajiyama decided to learn everything he could about bamboo farming so that he could combine the two businesses.\u201cThis is how I started farming,\u201d he says.In 2014, two years after they began working on the house, the couple were finally able to welcome their first guests.\u201cIt was a beautiful feeling,\u201d says Kajiyama. \u201cOf course, this was my dream. But people really appreciate that it was abandoned and I brought it back to life.\u201dHe says that hosting guests from all over the world has helped him to stay connected to his former life as a backpacker.\u201cI stay in one place, but people come to me and I feel like I\u2019m traveling,\u201d he says. \u201cToday, it\u2019s Australia, tomorrow it\u2019s the UK and next week South Africa and India.\u201cPeople come from different places and they invite me to join them for dinner, so sometimes I join someone\u2019s family life.\u201dSadly, Hila passed away from cancer in 2022. Kajiyama stresses that his beloved wife played a huge part in helping him achieve his dream of having a guesthouse and says he couldn\u2019t have done it without her.\u201cWe were really together,\u201d he adds. \u201cShe created this place with me. Without her it would not have been like this.\u201dWhile the three-bedroom guesthouse, which measures around 80 square meters, has been open for around eight years, Kajiyama is still working on it, and says he has no idea when he\u2019ll be finished.\u201cIt\u2019s never ending,\u201d he admits. \u201cI\u2019m halfway, I feel. It is beautiful already. But it started off abandoned, so it needs more details. And I\u2019m getting better at creating, so I need time to do it.\u201dHe explains that he\u2019s unable to complete work on the home while guests are there. And while the property is closed during the winter, he spends two months as a bamboo farmer and usually spends a month traveling, which doesn\u2019t leave him much time for renovations.\u201cSometimes I don\u2019t do anything,\u201d he admits.Yui Valley, which offers activities such as bamboo weaving workshops, has helped to bring many travelers to the village of Tamatori over the years.\u201cMost of the guests come after Tokyo, and it\u2019s such a contrast,\u201d he says. \u201cThey are really happy to share the nature and the tradition in our house.\u201cMost people have dreamed of coming to Japan for a long time and they have a very short time here.\u201cSo they have such a beautiful energy. I\u2019m happy to host in this way and join their holiday time. It\u2019s very special [for me].\u201dKajiyama estimates that he\u2019s spent around $40,000 on the renovation work so far, and if the feedback from guests, and locals, is anything to go by, it seems to have been money well spent.\u201cPeople appreciate what I\u2019ve done,\u201d he adds. \u201cSo that makes me feel special.\u201dAs for Hiroko, the woman who pointed out the house to him over a decade ago, Kajiyama says she\u2019s stunned at the transformation, and is amazed at how many international travelers are coming to Tamatori to stay at Yui Valley.\u201cShe cannot believe how much more beautiful it is [now],\u201d he says. \u201cShe didn\u2019t think it was going to be like this. So she really appreciates it. She says \u2018thank you\u2019 a lot.\u201d"

        "text": "Editor\u2019s Note:Sign up for. Get the latest news in aviation, food and drink, where to stay and other travel developments.The standard for luxury hotels in Vietnam has just gotten higher \u2013 literally.The new Vinpearl Landmark 81, Autograph Collection, has just opened inside the country\u2019s tallest building, Landmark 81, in Ho Chi Minh City.It clocks in at 461 meters (1,512 feet) high and overlooks the Saigon River in the eastern stretch of Vietnam\u2019s biggest city.Eight of Vietnam's hottest new hotelsUnsurprisingly, the sky-high views are a big draw.There are 223 rooms and suites spread across the property. The most luxurious of the group is the 68th-floor penthouse suite, which the hotel bills as both the largest and highest presidential suite in all of Vietnam.The 488-square-meter suite has two marble bathrooms, sleeping space for up to five people as well as a private chef and mixologist on request. Every single room, not limited to the suites, has floor-to-ceiling glass windows to allow for maximum enjoyment of the surroundings.Meanwhile, the hotel\u2019s Oriental Pearl restaurant takes, the noodle soup that is arguably the country\u2019s most famous dish \u2013 and makes it more upscale by using wagyu beef.18 of Asia's most underrated placesAt the appropriately-named cafe The Cloud, traditional Vietnamese coffees and locally-made chocolates are on offer.There are three event spaces at the Vinpearl. All three have outdoor terrace areas, and one of them is big enough to drive a car into, according to the hotel.In addition, there\u2019s a spa named Akoya, after a traditional Vietnamese pearl that symbolizes beauty. While there, visitors have the option to indulge in a spa treatment like a massage or facial or to spend time in the sauna, steam room or infinity pool.\u201cWe look forward to elevating the level of hospitality for local and international business and leisure travelers in this vibrant Vietnamese metropolis,\u201d the Vinpearl\u2019s general manager, Goetz Bauer, said in a statement.He added: \u201cWe hope to become a new beacon of light on the skyline, fostering meaningful connections between our cherished guests and the quintessential spirit of this compelling city.\u201dThe hotel \u2013 which is the Vietnam debut of Marriott\u2019s Autograph Collection brand \u2013 occupies 34 floors of the 81-floor skyscraper.The rest of Landmark 81 is a mix of private residences and public attractions.

CNN retains full editorial control over subject matter, reporting and frequency of the articles and videos within the sponsorship, in compliance with.Need help finding the hotel within Doha\u2019s airport? Look for the 23-foot-tall teddy bear made out of bronze and hang a right at the Hermes store.Passengers transiting throughin Qatar\u2019s capital can choose to leave the airport and join a free tour of some of the capital\u2019s most famous attractions, including Souq Waqif and the Golden Masjid.But others can opt to book a room at the Oryx, a Qatar Airlines-owned hotel conveniently located near the C,D, and E gates.As a swanky hotel in a swanky airport that regularly ranks at the top of the annual, it\u2019s no stretch to say this could be one of the planet\u2019s most luxurious transit hotels.If you can locate it.Because the oryx \u2013 a kind of antelope native to the Middle East \u2013 is the logo of Qatar Airways, the name is in use all over the airport, sometimes to confusing effect.Case in point: The Oryx lounge is just one floor (second) below the Oryx hotel (third), which means that a staff member is employed to hang out in the hotel lobby to run interference for lost travelers.To check in, passengers will need to show their passport and boarding pass. Doha is a \u201cquiet airport,\u201d which means that there are no oral announcements about boarding gates and passengers are expected to use screens or phone apps to figure out where to go. They\u2019ll also have to part with upwards of about US$450 per stay \u2013 significantly more expensive than a typical night\u2019s accommodation in Doha.Front desk staff at the hotel are efficient and helpful. As only transit passengers are staying there, reception will double and triple-check passengers\u2019 itineraries and offer a wake-up call to make sure they\u2019re awake in time to make their next flight.The world's best airports for 2023, according to Skytrax\u201cHamad International Airport operates as a  24-hours, seven-days-a-week facility and therefore all the different passenger touchpoints follow the same timeline,\u201d says Badr Mohammed Al Meer, chief operating officer for the airport.\u201cWe are constantly striving to offer the best and bespoke experiences for travelers, including our airport hotel offering. We want to provide them with an unmatched experience with a luxurious appeal, which is synonymous across the airport as a whole.\u201dThe Oryx is the only hotel within the airport itself, making it a logical choice for those with shorter layovers (by law, transit stays in the airport must be less than 24 hours). And there are also ways to experience the hotel without booking a room.Travelers may access the Oryx\u2019s \u201cvitality center\u201d at a cost of 175 riyals ($48) per person for up to four hours.This wellness-centric area, one floor above the rooms, has a squash court, golf simulator, spa and hydrotherapy pools and hot tubs in addition to a swimming pool.The narrow 25-meter (82-feet) long pool looks like it is encased in a glass jewel box.Silver geometric designs are a major motif around the airport, and that continues to the pool, whose blue water shimmers against the light coming in from the lattice shape of the metal walls and ceiling.Although there are some dress codes around public beaches in Qatar, the hotel is privately owned \u2013 meaning that guests can wear western swimwear. They can also order a poolside cocktail, as alcohol is permitted here as well.Unlike the hotel, which is open 24 hours a day, the vitality center closes from 2-6 a.m. Access to these areas is gratis for hotel guests, although you still have to pay for spa treatments.The treatments are designed specifically for travelers, like a massage for weary feet and a facial that addresses the dryness caused by recycled airplane air.The hotel shaped like two gigantic swordsThanks to Doha\u2019s role as a major global transit hub, some guests find themselves returning to the Oryx on repeat visits.One of those is Jane Jones, awho recently spent a 12-hour layover sleeping and swimming at the Oryx. It was her second time there \u2013 the first time, she had a shorter layover and opted for a pool and gym pass.Jones, who was en route to a holiday in Thailand this January, says the hotel\u2019s amenities are \u201ctop notch.\u201d\u201cOne thing I particularly appreciated was the convenience,\u201d she said. \u201cI was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the room.\u201dHer personal highlights were the speedy free Wi-Fi, which enabled her to get some work done before her flight and the wide variety of options \u2013 namely weight training and cardio \u2013 in the gym.\u201cI would definitely do it again,\u201d she adds.There are 100 rooms at the hotel, all spread out along one floor.Considering that an average of 40 million people pass through Hamad International Airport per year, there is high demand for rooms at the Oryx.Booking in advance is highly recommended. People whose plans have changed or are dealing with last-minute cancellations can come to the reception area and stand in a long line to try and get a room, but those who have pre-booked can skip ahead and check in with ease.The rooms themselves at the Oryx are light and airy. The walls are simple and cream-colored with the occasional burst of red or gold, while bed linens and towels are crisp, clean white. Overall, the design scheme creates a feeling of lightness.There are four main room types \u2013 superior (with one king bed), deluxe (one king bed and one twin), family (three beds), and executive suites (one king bed, but more floor space), as well as a posh presidential suite complete with a private lounge and powder room.Amenities make the rooms comfortable for a rest and recharge.Each room has a kettle for coffee and tea making purposes, two complimentary bottles of water, and a large rainforest shower \u2013 just the thing for a rejuvenation between flights.The other usual hotel amenities are there too: clothes hangers, an iron, a hair dryer, bathrobes, and slippers. In the bathroom, built-in shampoo dispensers and disposable toothbrushes mean you may not even need to take anything out of your own suitcase in order to freshen up.In-room power points are international, and there are also USB ports.And despite the airy, open feeling in the rooms and common spaces, there\u2019s one critical area where things feel heavy: window coverings.For people in desperate need of shuteye, the Oryx\u2019s bedrooms can be made extremely dark despite the presence of Doha\u2019s brilliant sunshine outside. And a good night\u2019s \u2013 or afternoon\u2019s \u2013 sleep may be the ultimate luxury of all."

For example, they can sample matcha lattes from a green tea shop with a 90-year history or see handmade Japanese craft umbrellas.Next up, developers want to include immersive elements in the visitor experience.\u201cIn the future, we\u2019d like visitors to be able to do more than just purchasing or looking at items.

The Gaya Vai-Mex vanilla plantation in Guti\u00e9rrez Zamora, in the eastern state of Veracruz, is the oldest in the region.Indigenous people first harvested the beans from Vanilla planifolia, a tropical orchid native to Veracruz, along the Gulf of Mexico. When Aztecs conquered the region, they taxed the Totonacs in the form of the prized vanilla. Following the Spanish invasion in 1519, vanilla was imported to Europe and became one of the most sought-after spices.Growing the pods is labor-intensive, making vanilla second only to saffron when it comes to the priciest spices.Gaya is the first woman to take charge of her family\u2019s vanilla business, which was established in 1873.\u201cThe first day, I had to drink a lot with the vanilla producers, so they would accept me,\u201d Gaya toldin 2007.In her kitchen, Gaya adds surprisingly versatile vanilla to everything, enhancing the flavor of salad dressing, coffee, pasta \u2014 and even chicken.Gaya\u2019s great-grandfather created the family\u2019s signature vanilla chicken recipe, which calls for a creamy, buttery sauce.Make this grilled fish with sour orange for taco nightShe made the heirloom dish for actor, producer and TV host Eva Longoria, who calls herself \u201cprobably the biggest fan of vanilla,\u201d in an episode of the CNN Original Series \u201cEva Longoria: Searching for Mexico.\u201dIn this specialty, the chicken is cooked in a sauce that contains 4 tablespoons \u2014 that\u2019s an entire \u00bc cup \u2014 of pure vanilla extract.

He told CNN at the time that there were roughly 320 people in the queue to the top in an area known as the \u201cdeath zone.\u201dThe more than 460 climbers who have received permission to climb this spring will be accompanied by more than 1,500 Nepali Sherpas and other staff at the base camp and above. To avoid overcrowding, Nepali authorities say they are setting up more than one rope wherever possible.Pierre Carter: The man who paraglided off Mount Everest and into the history books\u201cThe geography we can\u2019t change\u2026 but we are trying to manage by adding multiple ropes,\u201d Khatiwada told CNN.Three Sherpas died earlier this month after being buried by a block of snow on Everest, according to the official. They were delivering materials to construct and clear a route to be used by climbers to get to the top of the mountain.Nepal is home to eight of the 10 highest mountains in the world, so mountaineering is a significant source of revenue, employing large teams of people to support climbers."

        "text": "Written byLeonardo Da Vinci's \"Mona Lisa\" is one of thebest-known artworksin the world, famous for its beauty as well as the mystery surrounding the identity of the model and the location painted behind her.A source of debate for centuries, the village of Ponte Buriano, a suburb of Arezzo in the Tuscany region of Italy, is so convinced the bridge behind Mona Lisa is the Ponte Buriano that they've made it a key feature of their local tourism campaign, even laying claim to the bridge on the village's welcome sign.But now, historian Silvano Vinceti says that the bridge behind Mona Lisa is actually the Romito Bridge in the nearby Tuscan town of Laterina.\"The distinctive form of the Arno [River] along that stretch of territory corresponds to what Leonardo portrayed in the landscape to the left of the woman depicted in the famous painting,\" Vinceti said at a media conference at the Foreign Press Association in Rome on Wednesday.Vinceti also made a virtual reconstruction of the bridge to show the similarities, and drew on documents from the state archives in Florence.What's so special about the Mona Lisa?The \"Mona Lisa\" was painted in the early 16th century.Between 1501 and 1503 Da Vinci lived with Cardinal Cesare Borgia near Laterina, Vinceti found. The bridge was in use and had four arches -- as depicted in the artwork.On the other hand, the Buriano bridge has six arches, Vinceti said, and Ponte Bobbio, a bridge in Piacenza that some say features in the painting, has more than six arches.The Romito bridge linked Arezzo, Fiesole and Florence but is now in ruins. Vinceti said he studied drone images of the river banks, the ruins and photographs over the years to determine that the \"Etruscan-Roman Romito bridge is unmistakably\" the one in the background.The \"Mona Lisa\" by Leonardo Da Vinci on display at the Louvre in Paris.Laterina mayor Simona Neri was also in attendance at the press conference and is excited about the prospect of claiming the bridge to bring tourists to her town of 3,500 people.\"We really hope that this wonderful news will intrigue and fascinate local and foreign tourists, with the knowledge that it will be a great opportunity to relaunch the tourism of our territory on which we can work a lot starting from naturalistic, cultural and monumental valuation,\" she said.The 'Mona Lisa' has been caked in attempted vandalism stunt\"We need to try to protect what's left of the bridge, which will require funding,\" Neri said, noting that there are funds available for most areas tied to Da Vinci and other masters.\"There'll be some rivalry; we'll need to put a poster up, too,\" she added.Da Vinci's 16th century masterpiece is now housed at the Louvre in the Paris, where it is seen by millions of visitors each year. But experts say it owes its global fame to the fact that it was stolen from the gallery by Italian handyman Vincenzo Peruggia in 1911, rather than any artistic singularity.\"If a different one of Leonardo's works had been stolen, then that would have been the most famous work in the world -- not the 'Mona Lisa,'\" Noah Charney, professor of art history and author of \"The Thefts of the Mona Lisa,\" said in 2013, which marked the 100-year anniversary of when the painting was recovered.\"There was nothing that really distinguished it per se, other than it was a very good work by a very famous artist -- that's until it was stolen,\" he added. \"The theft is what really skyrocketed its appeal and made it a household name.\"Correction: This story has been updated to correct the name of the village that has long laid claim to the location of the bridge in the \"Mona Lisa\" artwork."

Get news about destinations opening, inspiration for future adventures, plus the latest in aviation, food and drink, where to stay and other travel developments.India is now home to the world\u2019s tallest railway bridge. Some 29 meters (over 95 feet) taller than the Eiffel Tower, the Chenab Bridge sits 359 meters (around 1,180 feet) above the Chenab River in India\u2019s contentious Jammu and Kashmir region.After decades of construction, the bridge in northern India will be open to visitors by the end of December 2023 or January 2024, the Ministry of RailwaysThe 1,315 meter-long (4,314 feet) bridge is part of a broader project to make the Kashmir Valley accessible by the Indian Railway network. In addition to the Chenab Bridge, the Udhampur-Srinagar-Baramulla Rail Link (USBRL) project involves what will become the country\u2019s longest transportation tunnel and Indian Railways\u2019 first cable bridge.For India\u2019s Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who swept to power in 2014 on a ticket of nationalism and a promise of future greatness, investments in infrastructure like the Chenab Bridge and the broader rail link project can be seen as a powerful tool for social integration and political influence, connecting disparate regions with key cities.\u201cThe bridge and the greater connectivity it\u2019s meant to create will be projected by New Delhi as another big victory for the region\u2019s development,\u201d said Michael Kugelman, director of the South Asia Institute at the Wilson Center.Slow progress for India's high-speed rail revolutionLinking Kashmir with the rest of India by train will specifically boost the region\u2019s industrial and agricultural sectors by allowing all-weather rail connectivity between the valley and the rest of India, experts say.Previously, the only land route connecting the Indian-controlled parts of Kashmir with the rest of the country was the winding 300-kilometer (185-mile) Srinagar-Jammu national highway, which closes during part of the winter and is also frequently the site of vehicle accidents.\u201cWe are getting lot of problems going across the road,\u201d Anil Kumar Mehendru, vice president of the New Kashmir Fruit Association, told CNN. \u201cOnce we will be connected by train with the rest of India, it will be a big boost to this industry, agriculture as well as fruit.\u201dSushant Singh, a senior fellow at the Centre for Policy Research in India, said the bridge also has political implications, as it\u2019s seen as \u201ca means of integrating Kashmir into India.\u201dAccording to Singh, \u201cthe hope historically\u201d was that the railway link, including the Chenab Bridge, would make Kashmir \u201cfeel more as a part of India.\u201dBut Singh told CNN it \u201cremains to be seen\u201d whether the expanded connectivity from the bridge and rail link is seen as a positive by Kashmiris, given that \u201cin recent years, Kashmir has been undermined by policies taken by Prime Minister Modi and his government which have really alienated the Kashmiris.\u201dIn 2019, India revoked a constitutional provision giving the Indian-controlled part of Kashmir the autonomy to set its own laws. The southern and eastern portions of the region known previously as the Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir became two separate union territories, a movewould promote stability, reduce corruption and boost the economy.\u201cNew Delhi\u2019s message, following that move, was that it would leverage its greater degree of control over Jammu and Kashmir to bring it greater development benefits,\u201d Kugelman said. \u201cIt will use the bridge as a high-visibility, eye-catching data point to argue its strategy is working.\u201d'Historic moment': India's first underwater metro route completes maiden runAlthough the overall USBRL project was established in 2002 before Modi became prime minister, the Chenab Bridge is already being touted as a prime example of his efforts to expand development in the country.India\u2019s Minister for Railways Ashwini Vaishnawthat \u201cThe iconic Chenab Bridge is example of such new chapters and dimensions of development materialized by the inspiring leadership of the Honorable Prime Minister.\u201dSince coming to power, Modi increased the budget of less than $100 million for the USBRL project by a factor of six to accelerate the bridge\u2019s completion after years of delays, Vaishnaw told, according to CNN affiliate News18.India has invested millions into modernizing its infrastructure. In February, Modiof a 1,386-kilometer (861-mile) expressway linking the capital New Delhi to the financial hub of Mumbai. The 246-kilometer section (153-mile) of the expressway alone cost $1.4 billion, the government said in a press release.Construction is also underway for the Western Dedicated Freight Corridor, which aims to decongest India\u2019s railway network.Correction: This article has been updated to clarify the height of the Eiffel Tower relative to the bridge.Mukhtar Ahmad in Srinagar, CNN\u2019s Rhea Mogul and Sania Farooqui contributed reporting."

CNN retains full editorial control over subject matter, reporting and frequency of the articles and videos within the sponsorship, in compliance with our.There\u2019s a party going on in Lusail.The palm-fringed Marina Walk, leading from the Arabian Gulf to the wide expanse that is Lusail Boulevard, is full of food stalls representing pretty much every nationality living in Qatar, and the boulevard is buzzing with life. This annual International Food Festival \u2013 the next edition is slated for January 24 - February 4, 2024 \u2013 is one of many events in Lusail. Like others, it has moved from the capital Doha to this, Qatar\u2019s newest city \u2013 10 miles north.Touted as Qatar\u2019s \u201cCity of the Future,\u201d construction of Lusail began in 2006, long before Qatar was announced as the host of the 2022 FIFA World Cup \u2013 yet you\u2019d have been hard pushed to have found many people who had visited before the grand Lusail Stadium became the main stage for the soccer tournament.Those who came found there\u2019s more to the city than event spaces. Lusail is home to grand shopping malls, theme parks, a wealth of international restaurants, islands, and two iconic new additions to the Qatar skyline.The Katara Towers, the near-circular building modeled on the scimitar swords that make up Qatar\u2019s emblem,, the Fairmont Doha and the all-suite Raffles Doha, the country\u2019s first six-star hotel. Both are the first properties for their respective hotel groups in Qatar \u2013 and while they\u2019re Doha by name, they\u2019re firmly Lusail by location.Then there are the four subtly twisting Lusail Plaza Towers, which seem to morph in height and shape as you approach the city. They\u2019re the work of Foster + Partners, who also designed the Lusail Stadium. Suspended between them is a shimmering metallic sculpture \u2013 a great whale-shark, \u201cAl Nehem,\u201d by Italian artist Marco Balich.Nineteen residential, business and mixed districts make up Lusail, some more developed than others \u2013 since the city is still under construction. The stadium and Lusail Plaza Towers are connected by Lusail Boulevard, which regularly plays host to parades and events, from the food festival to the annual Classic Car Show.The hotel shaped like two gigantic swordsThe anticipated Lusail Museum, which is still under construction, was designed by Swiss architects Herzog & de Meuron. Exhibiting orientalist and Middle Eastern art, it\u2019s slated to open in 2029.Tethered to the city shoreline by a six lane highway is entertainment-focused Al Maha Island, home to the Winter Wonderland theme park and a slew of international restaurants.It\u2019s swiftly becoming a rival in the livability stakes to crowded Doha.Lusail claims to be Qatar\u2019s first sustainable city \u2013 no easy task for a newbuild in the desert.Raising a city from the sand needs a lot of imagination.\u201cThe future of infrastructure is unlimited in the Middle East,\u201d says Bryce McDevitt, vice president of Parsons Corporation, which is overseeing construction. \u201cThere is a sense of imagination and possibility that doesn\u2019t exist anywhere else. Building a clean-sheet city allows for tailored design of your objectives: sustainability, accessibility and economic equality.\u201dHe adds: \u201cOne major advantage of the \u2018from the sand\u2019 approach is that when designing and building a city from scratch, we are not fettered by existing infrastructure. Roadways, airports, public transit, landscape, and urban design can all be built with smart sustainability in mind.\u201dOver the past few decades, little thought has been given to sustainability in Qatar \u2013 a desert state which has used its oil and gas resources to bring life to the barren land. Parks in the country\u2019s cities stay green all year round, and even have air-conditioned walkways to allow residents to take strolls even during summer, where temperatures can exceed 50 degrees Celsius (122 F).The mysterious symbols found carved in Qatar's desertLusail is changing that mindset, with sustainable tweaks built into the construction. There is a tram system designed to reduce the need for cars (essential elsewhere in Qatar), and systems to conserve and reuse water \u2013 for example, planting native vegetation which will reverse desertification and reduce rain runoff, as well as watering plants with non-potable water. An artificial reef is being built along the Lusail shoreline to encourage marine life to settle.It\u2019s the sustainability, space and amenities \u2013 as well as plenty of green spaces \u2013 which appealed to Katie Warner, a mobile travel agent originally from Australia. She and her husband swapped Doha for Lusail because it felt more ecologically minded. \u201cIt was pleasing to discover our building had sustainable systems in place like recycling water for the gardens, solar panels to heat the building\u2019s water, gas services for all cooking appliances, regulated electric use, and separate recycling and general waste chutes on each floor,\u201d she says.But that\u2019s not the only reason they moved: \u201cI love this area full of greenery, the gorgeous boardwalk, and views of the Persian Gulf.  It has all the day-to-day needs for groceries, transport, entertainment, and dining. There\u2019s an extensive choice from food trucks at the Lusail Marina Food Arena, abundant cafes, and fine dining restaurants.\u201dWhile Lusail\u2019s districts are each pretty much self-contained, and similar to the \u201c15-minute city\u201d concept loved by urban planners, overall Lusail \u2013 which sprawls across nearly 15 square miles, with an anticipated population of around 200,000 \u2013 still suffers a little from the disjointedness of many Gulf cities.Al Tara \u2013 the district, by Al Maha Island, where Warner lives \u2013 is home to the Lusail Marina. There are footpaths overlooking the water, art installations, small cafes dotted along the marina, and the Katara Towers. From here, it is just about possible to walk to Place Vend\u00f4me, a grand Paris-inspired shopping mall, and beyond it the Waldorf Astoria hotel, which sits on Lusail\u2019s only private beach. Trying to reach Lusail Boulevard is still somewhat of an undertaking, but one that is being addressed by the tram line, which began operation in 2022 and connects with the Doha metro.Inside Katara Cultural VillageBut while Lusail has superb \u2013 even newly iconic \u2013 architecture, grand outdoor spaces, and festivals and events, it will never have the organically grown, higgledy-piggledy layout of old Doha, which draws the tourists.Instead, it aims to be a modern, sustainable \u201cCity of the Future.\u201d Will it fall foul of the repeated curse that seems to befall many previous attempts of newly constructed cities, such as Canberra, Brasilia, Islamabad and Milton Keynes, where natural atmosphere and joie de vivre seem to be somewhat lacking? Only time will tell.There is a rumor \u2013 as yet unsubstantiated \u2013 that Lusail might eventually become Qatar\u2019s capital city. It\u2019s not actually a crazy idea \u2013 Sheikh Jassim Bin Mohammed Bin Thani, regarded as the founder of Qatar, built Lusail Castle, his 19th-century (and long gone) home, on the coast here.

Sign up to CNN Travel\u2019s four-partfor more on the country and its cuisine.Finding your own stretch of sand in Mexico is not too daunting. This country has around 5,800 miles of coastline (9,330 kilometers), and only a fraction of that is developed for visitors.Since most international vacationers head to the same few resort areas, that leaves a lot of beaches untouched, particularly for visitors willing to get a bit lost now and then.Many of these are completely off the grid, however. They\u2019re not served by paved roads and are  accessible only with a sturdy vehicle or a boat charter.Overnight visits to nature reserve beaches require signing up with an adventure tour operator with permission to set up camping facilities. These would include Esp\u00edritu Santo Island near La Paz or the barrier islands of Magdalena Bay on the other side of Baja, a top spot to see baby gray whales swimming with their mothers.These lesser-known beaches seldom see big crowds and traffic, but for added relaxation, you can order a Pacifico and ceviche with your toes in the sand or find a place to stay overnight.Is it safe to travel to Mexico? Here's what you need to knowFor visitors willing to pay for exclusivity, several resorts on the Costalegre coast between Puerto Vallarta and Manzanillo have beaches on their property that outsiders would only be able to reach by boat. The newest is, which opened at the end of 2022.At the 2,000-acre (809-hectare), which has its own airstrip, staffers can arrange for your group to have a whole beach to itself for one day. The resort has three from which to choose in addition to the main one in front of the rooms and restaurant.Intrepid travelers on a budget can find plenty of \u201csecret beaches\u201d along this Jalisco coast, too, starting just south of Puerto Vallarta and Mismaloya. Most are down the end of a dirt road or next to a two-store town full of fishing families, but hotel rooms are available at Mayto Beach, which goes on for miles.Few foreign visitors make it to the Oaxacan coast on the Pacific, though for surfers, the words \u201cPuerto Escondido\u201d are legendary. The high waves here are some of the most challenging in the Americas. So the main two-mile-long (3.2 kilometers) Playa Zicatela is better for strolling than swimming.Walking distance from the center of town is much calmer Playa Carrizalillo, where beachgoers can rent a chair for the day, order some drinks and fish tacos, and watch less skilled surfers taking lessons. Past that heading northwest is pocket beach Playa Coral and then very long and mostly empty Playa Bacocho.The crowds thin out even more about an hour east at Mazunte and Zipolite, beaches popular with backpackers and long-stay guests. (Be forewarned: Zipolite is a nude beach.)Find bargain-priced rentals and thin crowds \u2013 outside of local holiday periods anyway \u2013 at the Gulf Coast beaches stretching from Telchac Puerto to Celest\u00fan. These beach towns north of Yucat\u00e1n state\u2019s capital, M\u00e9rida, are just dots on the map in both directions from port city Progreso.There are no high-rise hotels and few resorts along this coast, withbeing the only all-inclusive option on the water. It\u2019s more common for visitors to rent a beach house of some kind, ranging from small cottages at bargain rates to 10-bedroom villas with an infinity pool.8 Mexican ruins you can have to yourselfThe Riviera Maya of Quintano Roo is built up with hundreds of resorts between Holbox Island down through Canc\u00fan to Tulum, so every decade it gets harder to find a mellow Caribbean beach on this coast.Almost all the way to Belize, however, the small settlement of Mahahual still feels sleepy and undiscovered. Most of the visitors are quick-stop cruise ship passengers calling at the purpose-built Costa Maya port on the northern edge of town, but after they\u2019ve pulled out, the beach goes back to being empty.Only a few hotels here are more than $100 per night. Some are in the $35 to $70 range, so it\u2019s easy to stick around for a while for snorkeling off the shore, a scuba diving excursion to Banco Chinchorro or kayaking the nearby lagoons.Technically, all beaches in Mexico are open to everyone, but the private beach clubs of the Punta Mita development north of Puerto Vallarta are really accessible only to homeowners and renters inside the massive gated community.The two luxury resorts in the complex \u2013and\u2013 have their own long stretches of beach that are occupied by hotel guests. The price of renting a villa or hotel suite within the gates of Punta Mita comes with the assurance of lounging on an uncrowded, pristine Pacific beach.For a nearby option that doesn\u2019t require any credentials, Playa Litibu is a walk down the sand from Punta Mita\u2019s Kupuri Beach Club.Best Mexican food: 23 dishes to tryChiapas is known as an adventure state with jungles, Mayan ruins and the mountain city of San Crist\u00f3bal de las Casas.It does have a few nice beaches \u2013 and ones that only see a crowd if it\u2019s a Mexican holiday period, when residents of the capital Tuxtla Guti\u00e9rrez head to the shore. The Puerto Arista beach is 20 miles long (32 kilometers) so there\u2019s bound to be a quiet spot on the sand on the Pacific.The upscale resortcan top $250 a night for double occupancy in high season, but most hotels in the area go for less than $100 a night.Todos Santos, about an hour north of Cabo San Lucas, has a main beach that doesn\u2019t get all that crowded, with just a few hotels along its roughly 10 miles (16 kilometers) of sandy shores. Since the town itself is on the other side of a lagoon, it\u2019s easy to find an isolated stretch of beach to enjoy.Lace up some hiking shoes, however, and you can trek across the tops of dramatic cliffs to reach Playa Las Palmas, a gorgeous crescent of sand that can otherwise only be reached by four-wheel-drive. This one is good for swimming, while other beaches, such as Playa La Pastora, are better for surfing and boogie boarding."

        "text": "is a CNN Travel series that spotlights some of the most fascinating topics in the travel world. In April, we\u2019re taking a thrilling ride into the world of theme parks.Taylor Jeffs is living his dream.Growing up in Orange County, California, near Disneyland and Knott\u2019s Berry Farm, he visited some of the world\u2019s best theme parks on a regular basis.\u201cBack then, it definitely wasn\u2019t cool to be into theme parks, but I was obsessed,\u201d Jeffs, 39, tells CNN.\u201cI understood how special and important they can be and would dream about working in the industry.\u201dDisneyland's record-breaking regular shares his wisdom from nearly 3,000 park visits in a rowFast-forward a few decades later, and he\u2019s overseen some of the world\u2019s most immersive rides and parks as the co-owner, president and chief creative officer of, a leading entertainment design and production firm based in California.In addition to theme parks, Jeffs has also been involved in a range of creative pursuits, such as producing hit Broadway and off-Broadway shows, choreographing drone shows, and consulting as a creative director for Cirque du Soleil.From hustling at Disneyland as a teen to designing and building theme parks around the globe, Jeffs shares what it\u2019s like to create immersive worlds that bring families together.Obsessed with Disneyland from a young age, Jeffs wanted to work there as soon as possible.At the time, you had to be at least 17 years old, he recalls, but luckily, he found a loophole.\u201cThrough California\u2019s ROP (regional occupational program), I could earn high school credits instead of money, so at 15, I got a job as a sub-burger flipper \u2013 a rung below a burger flipper \u2013 at a restaurant in Frontierland,\u201d he recalls.Later, he worked as a Disney tour guide and then conducted park surveys for the marketing team.\u201cEvery day, I\u2019d hear how much people loved the park\u2019s scale and colors, landscapes and music,\u201d recalls Jeffs. \u201cHearing that feedback on a daily basis, and learning how much they valued the experience was an important foundation for my career.\u201dNew to the Caribbean: A theme park like it's never seen beforeJeffs worked at Disneyland for five years before joining what was then the Goddard Group (now Legacy Entertainment) in 2002 as an intern.The group had recently laid off hundreds of employees due to a steep decline in tourism following the September 11 terrorist attacks in 2001.The resulting all-hands-on-deck atmosphere enabled Jeffs to work on high-profile projects, from Hershey\u2019s Chocolate World to the Georgia Aquarium.In 2008, then 24, Jeffs designed and produced his first attraction: \u201cGlow in the Park,\u201d a family-friendly night parade at Six Flags Mexico.He had a relatively small budget \u2013 \u201c$1.5 million all-in, less than half of what Disney would spend on a single parade float at the time,\u201d he estimates \u2013 but brought several big names on board, like Raul Rodriguez, who designed hundreds of floral floats for California\u2019s Rose Parade, and Beno\u00eet Jutras, a principal Cirque du Soleil composer.With its illuminated floats, original soundtrack, dancers, drummers and cartoon characters, the parade was so successful Six Flags commissioned five more for other parks in the chain.After the Great Recession in 2008, the company shifted its focus to Asia.They\u2019ve since built an impressive portfolio, from Studio City Macau to Chimelong Marine Science Park in China, Lotte Worlds in South Korea, Trans Studio parks in Indonesia, Shanghai Haichang Ocean Park and the Sea Shell Aquarium in Vietnam, to name a few.When it comes to designing theme parks, Jeffs says the process begins with a feasibility study, followed by a \u201cblue sky\u201d brainstorm in which the team throws out their wildest ideas.\u201cWe just go nuts \u2013 attraction ideas, crazy restaurant concepts, social media moments, landscape possibilities, all of it,\u201d Jeffs explains. \u201cI also collect around 200 benchmark images, like a book of inspiration, to gauge what resonates and what doesn\u2019t.\u201dAfter receiving client feedback, they start sketching and diagramming the park\u2019s layout and key features.Over several iterations, the park design becomes increasingly specific \u2013 down to the placement of light posts and the number of turnstiles \u2013 until it\u2019s time to start construction.\u201cOften, design continues during construction,\u201d he adds. \u201cAnd then ideally, we will have producers, managers, technical directors, art directors on the ground through opening day.\u201d10 fascinating theme parks that have closed foreverEvery so often, one of those blue-sky ideas gets the green light.Jeffs points to the immersive \u201cPacific Rim: Shatterdome Strike\u201d ride at Trans Studio Cibubur, part of Indonesia\u2019s largest theme park chain, as an example.In a conventional dark ride experience, a vehicle moves through a themed world with music, blacklights and special effects.But Jeffs and his team pitched a plot twist. What if the ride broke down and passengers would have to grab flashlights and continue on foot while a monster attacks, then reboard to fight the monster and escape?\u201cWe didn\u2019t think they\u2019d go for it, but they did! And then we even had some of our own people saying, \u2018That\u2019s crazy. It won\u2019t work.\u2019 But we figured out a way \u2013 and now it\u2019s now one of the most successful dark rides in recent history \u201d says Jeffs.In another instance, they reimagined the \u201cpre-show\u201d concept \u2013 typically, a video that plays before the ride begins.\u201cThe ride was all about escaping, so we thought: instead of a video, what if we lock you in a jail cell, and you have to solve a puzzle to break out of before you start the ride?\u201dAnd then there was the Golden Reel.In Macau, Jeffs helped design Studio City Macau, a Hollywood-themed hotel, and the Golden Reel \u2013 the world\u2019s first figure-eight Ferris wheel \u2013 in the middle of the hotel\u2019s facade.\u201cWe came up with the idea to build a Ferris wheel between the towers. But it was Lawrence Ho, the founder of Studio City, who wanted to do a figure-eight because eight is a lucky number in Chinese culture as a homonym for wealth,\u201d says Jeffs.\u201cLawrence said he didn\u2019t care if the ride was empty \u2013 it was all about the wow factor.\u201dThis tiny town is the site of Disney's 'lost' parkBut in most cases, wild and crazy ideas won\u2019t fly unless they satisfy commercial needs.\u201cIt\u2019s an art and a science \u2013 these two things have to meet,\u201d says Jeffs. \u201cCapacity drives everything, so we need to make sure that there\u2019s plenty to do and people don\u2019t spend their entire visit waiting in line.\u201dMoreover, every member of the family should be able to have a good time.\u201cIt\u2019s our job to make sure there is a variety \u2013 enough attractions without height requirements for parents with babies, thrill rides for teenagers, and parades and shows for everyone,\u201d he adds.That was his approach when designing Lotte World Adventure in Busan, South Korea, which opened in 2022.From family-friendly trains to flume rides, hair-raising roller coasters, parades and stage shows and immersive restaurants, there\u2019s something for every age group.For a timeless feel, the team took cues from European gardens, incorporating lush green spaces, plazas and water features that will \u201conly get more beautiful with time,\u201d says Jeffs.\u201cWhen I was growing up, theme park design was often dismissed as a rinky-dink, second-class artistic discipline simply because it was rarely well done.\u201cI\u2019m happy to say that this is unquestionably no longer the case. Over the last 15 years, we\u2019ve seen the fulfillment of what this medium can be when it\u2019s firing on all cylinders.\u201d10 of the best new luxury hotels opening in Asia in 2023As expected, a demanding travel schedule comes with the territory.Before the pandemic, Jeffs would spend a week each month in Asia, meeting with various clients and governments.\u201cI\u2019ve flown over 3 million miles, stayed over four years in hotels, collected around 2,000 hotel room keys, and visited six out of seven continents \u2013 all as part of the job,\u201d he says.When travel came to a halt in 2020, he embarked on a road trip across America with his family.\u201cThat first summer, we drove 10,000 miles and hit up virtually any theme park that had managed to re-open,\u201d he says.The family had so much fun that they spent two months on the road the following summer, including a month at Walt Disney World in Florida.And though he\u2019s ridden over 600 roller coasters and explored theme parks worldwide, Disneyland in California remains his all-time favorite park.\u201cFrom a design standpoint, it\u2019s perfect. It\u2019s the only park Walt Disney worked on personally,\u201d Jeffs gushes.\u201cAnd since film production designers staged it, the forced perspective of the buildings on Main Street, the human scale of the architecture, the color choices, the castle, the intimacy of the lands \u2013 you don\u2019t get that at any other Disney park in quite the same way.\u201dThese days, rediscovering the magic of theme parks with his two daughters \u2013 aged 5 and 1.5 \u2013 has made him appreciate them all the more.\u201cWhen I go to parks with my family, we\u2019ve found that babies and toddlers can\u2019t participate in many of the attractions. It has focused my thinking when building programs for our parks,\u201d says Jeffs.\u201cWhile we can\u2019t forgo height restrictions entirely, I now find myself  incorporating more universal entertainment experiences that the whole family can enjoy together.\u201d"

        "text": "Editor\u2019s Note:Sign up forCNN Travel\u2019s weekly newsletter. Get news about destinations opening, inspiration for future adventures, plus the latest in aviation, food and drink, where to stay and other travel developments.As Saudi Arabia continues its drive to attract tourists, authorities in the country appear to be reaching out to a particularly lucrative section of the market: LGBTQ travelers.The website of the Saudi Tourism Authority (STA) seems to have had its Q&A section updated to state that gay visitors are welcome in the kingdom.\u201cEveryone is welcome to visit Saudi Arabia and visitors are not asked to disclose such personal details,\u201d is the website\u2019s response to the question: \u201cAre LGBT visitors welcome to visit Saudi Arabia?\u201dIt is not known exactly when the website was updated. A spokesperson for the STA said the policy had previously been in place, but anon March 14, 2023 and before did not have the question and answer on the page.Same-sex sexual activity is an offense in Saudi Arabia, according to.According to the, which campaigns for the rights of LGBT people around the world, trans people can also face prosecution in Saudi, with \u201csubstantial evidence of the law being enforced\u201d and \u201cconsistent reports of discrimination and violence\u201d against LGBTQ people.LGBTQ+ travelers are a lucrative market, according to Darren Burn, CEO of, a luxury travel planning service for the community, and of, the world\u2019s largest LGBTQ+ travel platform.\u201cResearch shows they spend more money in a destination than heterosexual couples, and tend to travel more times a year,\u201d he told CNN.\u201cIt\u2019s a very interesting and lucrative demographic, and countries are plowing major revenue into [attracting] it.\u201dWhether LGBTQ travelers will feel comfortable traveling to Saudi, however, is another matter. Burn said that destinations such as the Maldives and Dubai, where homosexuality is a criminal offense, are popular, but without more assurances from the authorities, Saudi Arabia could be a tougher sell.\u201cIt\u2019s pretty vague, and doesn\u2019t offer the assurances that would make me feel able to send our clients safely to the destination, but anything on the website about LGBT travelers is a good starting point,\u201d he said.\u201cI can\u2019t think of another Middle Eastern tourist board that has even mentioned them, except Qatar in the run-up to the World Cup, and even that was vague, saying that everyone was welcome.\u201cBut my concern is what the reality is like in the destination. Are they saying that a same-sex couple can check into a hotel and get a double bed without any issues? My hunch would be that that\u2019s not the reality.\u201dOne gay traveler who visited Saudi Arabia on a work trip in October 2022 \u2013 before the website was updated \u2013 told CNN that he felt \u201cin the closet\u201d during his stay.The UK traveler \u2013 who did not want to be named \u2013 spent time in AlUla, one of Saudi\u2019s tourism-focused destinations.\u201cIt was OK for a week or so but after that I suddenly realized it gone back to living a life in the closet and not being my true self. More out of fear of what might happen \u2013 the unknown \u2013 rather than anything specific that happened,\u201d he said.\u201cI was sent an email [by the company I was working for] with what I should do. They basically told me to delete anything even remotely LGBTQI related from my phone \u2013 all photos, apps, newspapers and magazines. My Egyptian friend suggested I just get a new clean phone.\u201cI told close colleagues, but I wasn\u2019t [generally] talking about being gay, or my past experience. I kept it to myself, and suddenly realized that I wasn\u2019t able to talk about what I would normally talk about, and that\u2019s not how I want to live. In practice everyone was very relaxed, but the law\u2019s the law.\u201dWhat it's like to visit Saudi Arabia nowHowever, he added that one \u201crevelation\u201d from his trip was \u201chow friendly and welcoming the Saudi people were.\u201cThey\u2019re really open to changing attitudes, but they haven\u2019t really [been in contact] with the Western world in their lifetimes. Unless you meet people [from other cultures] and talk about differences there\u2019s no way of learning from them.\u201cI found that what the law and the authorities say is very different to how the locals interact with you.\u201cIf you were to go there and be overtly gay I\u2019d be quite concerned \u2013 I wouldn\u2019t feel comfortable going there with a partner \u2013 but it\u2019s a country that\u2019s changing very quickly.\u201dSaudi Arabia is focusing on, appealing to archaeology fans at the likes of AlUla, where ruins have been left untouched for almost 2,000 years, and creating entire new cities to appeal to visitors.CNN\u2019s Richard Quest, who, wrote that: \u201cI have seen countries change before, but I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever seen anything quite like the change taking place in Saudi Arabia. Saudi\u2019s change is deliberate, deep-reaching and dramatic.\u201d He also flagged its \u201ccontradictions,\u201d however \u2013 after his visit, 81 people were executed in a single day.Human rights researchertold CNN that the kingdom is following Qatar and Dubai in its bid to attract LGBTQ+ travelers. But she warned that it might not be on the travelers\u2019 terms.\u201cIn Dubai there are a lot of gay influencers, and as long as you understand the context of the area you\u2019re in and respect the traditional culture and not show your queerness in any way, you\u2019re OK,\u201d she said.\u201cThat requires you to be cis-passing. If you show up and you\u2019re non-binary, or male with makeup on, or obviously trans, and come to the region you\u2019ll be denied entrance. I wouldn\u2019t say LGBT people are welcome \u2013 they say same-sex couples are welcome, and that\u2019s entirely different.\u201dShe also warned that what goes for \u201crich tourists\u201d doesn\u2019t fly for others. \u201cQueer residents know what lines they can cross, and it\u2019s all down to your economic and social background,\u201d she said. \u201cThey realize the risks with this kind of activity and know how to do it in a discreet way. This [the new move] is basically for Western tourists.\u201cThey\u2019re trying to copy the Dubai model so they can get some of their money. There\u2019s a lot of competition [for money]. If you\u2019re a cis, gay Westerner you\u2019re welcome. If you\u2019re trans and cis-passing, you\u2019re welcome. But anything that remotely shows your queerness, you\u2019re not. And I think if anyone crosses a line, they will definitely act swiftly.\u201dWhat it's like to visit Saudi Arabia nowDespite his skepticism, Darren Burn thinks Saudi could potentially be a gay-friendly destination.\u201cWe\u2019d welcome a conversation with the tourist board and government to work out a way that LGBTQ+ travelers can genuinely travel in a safe way, to see them put money behind promoting to LGBT communities, and making changes to LGBT rights locally to make Saudi Arabia an authentic destination that appeals.\u201cWe all know the reason destinations are welcoming tourists now is because they think that\u2019s their future income stream, but that\u2019s good, because it might drive changes in equality law if it\u2019s good for business.\u201dHe added that travel can broaden minds on both sides.\u201cWithout travel and tourists coming to the destinations, mindsets would never change \u2013 as long as they can do so safely, LGBTQ+ travelers can break down barriers,\u201d he said.\u201cDestinations do change \u2013 but I don\u2019t think we\u2019d be sending customers any time soon until we can receive assurances that they\u2019d be safe, welcome and able to check in.\u201dAn STA spokesperson said in a statement: \u201cEveryone is welcome to visit Saudi, provided that they follow and respect our culture, traditions and laws, as you would when you visit any other country in the world.\u201cLike other governments, we do not ask visitors personal questions and we respect the right to privacy.\u201d"

        "link": "https://edition.cnn.com/travel/article/50-best-pizza-europe-2023/index.html",
        "text": "Editor\u2019s Note:Sign up to CNN Travel\u2019sfor insider intel on Italy\u2019s best loved destinations and lesser-known regions to plan your ultimate trip. Plus, we\u2019ll get you in the mood before you go with movie suggestions, reading lists and recipes from Stanley Tucci.For years, Italians have been notoriously prickly about preserving their culinary traditions. Pineapple on pizza?. Spaghetti bolognese?.But now, some Italians seem to be wising up to the fact that other countries can make good Italian food, too.Enter, an international guide run by Italians that produces a series of annual rankings rewarding some of the best pizzerias on the planet. The 2023 European list has just been published \u2013 and, according to 1,000 anonymous \u201cinspectors\u201d across the continent, the best pizza in Europe is in\u2026 Spain., in Barcelona, was judged the best on the continent. The award was announced at a ceremony, which was also held in Barcelona.Second place went to Copenhagen restaurant, while coming in third wasin London, a spin-off of the original 50 Kal\u00f2 pizzeria in Naples.There\u2019s a catch of course. Italy was not in competition. The entity \u2013 a pizza guide, which has been ranking restaurants since 2017 \u2013 has separate listings for the 50 best pizzerias in the cradle of pizza.Sartoria Panatieri is run by Rafa Panatieri and Jorge Sastre. Panatieri grew up in Brazil, but with Italian origins, from Pisa and Calabria. Initially training as a veterinarian, he changed tack to become a chef in South America and Italy, before moving to Spain. He worked in Michelin-starred restaurant Nectari in Barcelona before opening his pizzeria.In a statement, Panatieri said: \u201cWe are very proud to have been named the best pizzeria in Europe. This award is a recognition to the dedication that we put every day in Sartoria Panatieri since we opened five years ago with the intention of fulfilling a dream that today we have been able to fulfill thanks to the work of the entire team.\u201dThe 2,000-year history of Italy's favorite dishPanatieri also took home the award for Pizza of the Year 2023  with his \u201cSalsa de tomates cherry asados, mozzarella y holandesa de albahaca\u201d wood-fired pizza: tomato sauce, mozzarella, roasted cherry tomatoes and basil hollandaise. The pizza costs \u20ac12.90 ($14.20). Pie prices at the restaurant start from $12.Meanwhile, 50 Kal\u00f2, which had been awarded first place in previous rankings, has slid down the list in recent years. However, it did take home the award for the \u201cbest fried pasta pie\u201d this year.50 Top Pizza has listings for pizzerias across the globe. They\u2019re created by around 1,000 \u201cinspectors\u201d around the world, who first vote for the best places in their own countries, and then make anonymous visits.\u201cFor each pizzeria we have several reports of anonymous visits that help us complete the work of ranking,\u201d Barbara Guerra, one of three curators, told CNN. \u201cBasically the ranking is the result of a group work in which we curators are the coordinators. We believe that only the work of a large team can help us make a list that primarily conveys current trends.\u201dGuerra said that Neapolitan style pizza is still the world\u2019s favorite, but that the inspectors aren\u2019t specifically looking for it.They reward \u201cestablishments that have personality and consistency, offer great pizza (of any style) and have friendly service,\u201d she said, adding that Sartoria Panatieri and B\u00e6st  are both Neapolitan-inspired but with \u201ca completely different personality.\u201dGuerra said that Italians are rightly proud of their culinary traditions.\u201cItaly is the country of pizza and Naples is the capital of pizza, it is normal that Italians have a lot of pride and strongly defend this product,\u201d she said.\u201cHowever, every Italian who travels [abroad] can easily realize how much the quality has grown in all European capitals. This is thanks to so many Italian pizza makers in the world but also thanks to people of all nationalities who have learned the art of making pizza in Italy or with Italians. The model is almost always the Neapolitan pizza but then it is expressed in so many ways.\u201dShe explained that the rise of real Italian pizza abroad is a relatively recent phenomenon. \u201cTen years ago in London or Paris you would find so many pizzerias where an Italian would find it hard to identify himself,\u201d Guerra said. \u201cYou would see a national product treated very badly. Today this is not the case.\u201dIt's been claimed pizza and carbonara are American. Here's how that went down in ItalyAs for the Italy rankings, they will be revealed in Rome on July 12.They\u2019re preceded by the top 50 listings in Asia-Pacific (May 30) and USA (June 27). The big one \u2013 worldwide rankings \u2013 will be held on September 13 in Naples. The top 25 ranked European pizzerias will go through to the world finals, in which 100 from across the globe will be ranked against each other.So why do we all love pizza? For Guerra, it\u2019s \u201ca food that brings joy, simple and satisfying \u2013 and is the only food at an affordable price that\u2019s prepared in front of your eyes.\u201cThe real value of pizza, especially Neapolitan pizza, is that it is healthy food with fresh ingredients, freshly prepared at an affordable price,\u201d she added.1: Sartoria Panatieri: Barcelona, Spain2: B\u00e6st: Copenhagen, Denmark3: 50 Kal\u00f2: London, UK4: Via Toledo Enopizzeria: Vienna, Austria5: Pizza Zul\u00f9: F\u00fcrth, Germany6: Fratelli Figurato: Madrid, Spain7: Forza: Helsinki, Finland8: Napoli on the Road: London, UK9: nNea: Amsterdam, Netherlands10: La Balmesina: Barcelona, Spain"

They won\u2019t let us board until they remove the bees. But how on earth will this happen? Won\u2019t they leave the wing when we take off?Enjeti mentions a beekeeper and pest control in her live updates, which were apparently gleaned from Delta announcements and word of mouth from other passengers. She also gave a blow-by-blow of jockeying for position by the airport windows in hopes of witnessing a beekeeping operation, complete with snacks for the show.Alas, no beekeeper appeared, according to Enjeti\u2019s account, much to her disappointment.\u201cWould have a big highlight of my life to see a bee keeper de-bee a plane wing. It\u2019s going to be hard to let go of this.

Get news about destinations opening, inspiration for future adventures, plus the latest in aviation, food and drink, where to stay and other travel developments.In the early days of the invasion of Ukraine, the European Union and Russia closed off their airspace to each other \u2013 an aerial blockade that has remained in place ever since.Now that China has reconnected to the world after almost three years of Covid border closures \u2013 welcome news to the world\u2019s recovering tourism markets \u2013  some in the European aviation industry are calling out what they feel is an unlevel playing field.During a visit to China in April, French President Emanuel Macron announced that France-headquartered Airbus landed huge deals in China, as the two countries vowed to \u201cresume airlinks to pre-pandemic levels as quickly as possible.\u201dHowever, reviving these air links could be a much simpler prospect for Chinese airlines than European.Like other passengers flying on European carriers to Asia, Macron did not take the quickest route between France and China \u2013 his plane avoided flying over Russia for both political and security reasons.But because Beijing and Moscow are still friends, direct, quicker routes remain open over Russian airspace, requiring less fuel and bringing better profits.\u201cThe closure of Russian airspace for European airlines has forced European carriers to take detours, involving more southern flight routes to East and Southeast Asia,\u201d Laurent Donceel, managing director of Airlines for Europe (A4E) told CNN.\u201cThis has resulted in longer flight times and added to the fuel used on these flights.\u201dThe biggest airline association in Europe, A4E\u2019s members include major players such as British Airways, Air France, KLM, Lufthansa and Finnair, all of which have had routes and flight times affected by the closure of Russian airspace.Macron counting on China's Xi 'to reason' with Russia over Ukraine warFinnair, which operates out of a major aviation hub at Helsinki, has been hit the most due to its proximity to Russia, according to Donceel. A flight between Helsinki and Singapore now has an additional 1,400 kilometers (2,250 miles) to negotiate.Between Helsinki and Seoul, that\u2019s an extra 4,000 kilometers one-way.\u201cTo put that in context, 1,400 kilometers adds 1.25 hours to the flight, and 4,000 kilometers adds seven hours on a round trip between Helsinki and Seoul,\u201d Donceel said.While that certainly spells more inconvenience for passengers, Donceel added that it also has commercial implications.\u201cThis does put European airlines at a competitive disadvantage,\u201d he said.Ben Smith, CEO of the Air France-KLM Group called it an \u201cunfair advantage\u201d in anpublished on February 17.French Transport Minister Cl\u00e9ment Beaune told CNN at the end of February that he has yet to receive any official complaints from Air France.Currently China Eastern\u2019s direct flights from Shanghai take 12 hours, while Air France, which it partners with through the SkyTeam airline alliance, takes 14 hours.Where are Chinese travelers heading now that borders have reopened?Similarly, the direct flight from Frankfurt to Beijing on German carrier Lufthansa takes 11 hours while its Chinese partner in Star Alliance, Air China, needs only nine hours.Star Alliance declined to comment on this issue.Some Western airlines have abandoned routes to East Asia. Virgin Atlantic put an official end to its London to Hong Kong route in March after almost 30 years of service, citing the logistical impact of the detour.\u201cOn the basis of Russian airspace remaining closed, Heathrow \u2013 Hong Kong flight times would be approximately 60 minutes longer and Hong Kong \u2013 Heathrow flight time would be 1 hours and 50 minutes longer than prior to airspace closure,\u201d the airline told CNN.Founder of Virgin Group, Richard Branson expressed his support for a ban on all Chinese carriers flying to the UK via Russian airspaceat the end of 2022.He told the newspaper that airlines flying over Russia were indirectly helping the Kremlin\u2019s war effort.Russian airspace bordering Ukraine has been closed to all commercial airlines since the start of the invasion.The European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA), in itsupdate on March 16, also advised that airlines flying over Moscow-administered airspace should exercise caution due to \u201cheightened military activity which may include launches of mid-range missiles penetrating into controlled airspace.\u201dThe risk of flying in proximity to active conflict zones was brutally highlighted in 2014, when Malaysian Airline MH17 flight from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur was shot down over eastern Ukraine, killing 298 people.Investigators later concluded that the missile which downed the plane was fired from a launcher belonging to Russia\u2019s 53rd anti-aircraft missile brigade.China\u2019s European routes do not fly near Ukraine airspace. They primarily enter or depart Russian airspace above the Baltic Sea, near St. Petersburg.'Everything starts to become better': After three years of Covid isolation, China opens its gatesWhether Chinese travelers  \u2013 or passengers heading on the return leg from Europe \u2013 are concerned about the risks of flying through any Russian airspace remains to be seen.CNN has reached out to the three main state-owned Chinese airlines \u2013 Air China, China Eastern and China Southern \u2013 for comments.For now, Chinese airlines have yet to return to full pre-pandemic capacities. For instance, China Southern Airlines, with its base in the southern city of Guangzhou, will still only have one flight per week for its routes connecting Guangzhou to Paris and Frankfurt for the summer fall season of 2023, while pre-pandemic level was at one flight per day.But as Chinese airlines gradually return to normal and the war in Ukraine continues to rage on,  European airlines could potentially face more fierce challenges on routes between Europe and East or Southeast Asia, creating some interesting choices for passengers.CNN\u2019s Oliver Briscoe contributed reporting."

        "text": "Editor\u2019s Note:is a CNN Travel series that spotlights some of the most fascinating topics in the travel world. As the UK crowns a new monarch, we\u2019re exploring all things royal, from castles to grand tours.Royals? They\u2019re just like us! Well, they\u2019re not, obviously \u2013 but sometimes they do put down their tiaras, leave their palaces and join the hoi polloi at restaurants, bars and even theme parks.If you\u2019re a fan of the British royal family, you\u2019ll likely have already visited sites like Buckingham Palace, Windsor and Hampton Court (and if you haven\u2019t,on where to start).Keen to soak up a different kind of royal atmosphere? Here are 18 places in and around London where the Windsors have been spotted walking among us.Brilliant by name, and brilliant by nature, at least if King Charles III is to be believed. He once calledin Southall, west London his\u2013 and Gordon Ramsay is also a fan.If you\u2019re flying into Heathrow for your royal visit, that\u2019s brilliant news \u2013 since the restaurant is on the way into central London, and an easy 12-minute walk from Southall station, which serves the equally royal Elizabeth Line.The Anand family opened the Brilliant in 1975 \u2013 today it\u2019s run by the third generation \u2013 and the food is Punjabi with Kenyan influences (the family previously had a restaurant in Nairobi).If you prefer something more central, chef Dipna Anand also has a restaurant in the city center,. Brilliant!The late Queen Elizabeth was apparently a big fan of chocolate \u2013 so far, so relatable.What might surprise you, though, is that her favorite chocolatier sounded rather more French than British., in the glitzy shopping quarter of Bond Street, was founded in 1875 by two women: one a chocolatier from Paris, the other a London artisan who made jewelry and hat boxes.The company has held a royal warrant from the late Queen since 1970 \u2013 the chief chocolatier previously revealed that Her Majesty had \u201c,\u201d and hinted that she liked their rose and violet creams.Predictably they have a whole range ofand hampers. Extra royal nugget \u2013 Charbonnel and Walker were apparently introduced to each other by the King Edward VII prior to his own ascension to the throne.Royal London: Buckingham, Windsor and other must-see sightsBack in the noughties, party Prince Harry was a regular at, a Tiki-themed bar-club-restaurant in Mayfair. It\u2019s been going strong since 2006, in no small part thanks to the early patronage of the then-young royals.Kate and William were fans, too, and Jack Brooksbank, who\u2019s now married to Princess Eugenie, was once manager.Try the signature Treasure Chest cocktail, which William apparently liked: \u201cgrog,\u201d Courvoisier and peach liqueur tipped into a pirate-style chest and swilled with Champagne. The price? That depends on whether you\u2019re using Moet, Dom Perignon or Louis Roederer as the mixer, darling. From $199 to $835 \u2013 but it serves eight.Another Harry favorite,is still going strong on posh Sloane Square. It\u2019s a 1980s-themed club named after Margaret Thatcher, the former Conservative Prime Minister whose photo is everywhere inside.So the story goes, back in the 1980s, when Princess Diana was the most famous woman on the planet, sheto visit the, one of London\u2019s best known gay bars.In her memoir, Diana\u2019s friend, actress Cleo Rocos told of an afternoon spent drinking with the princess, comedian Kenny Everett and Queen singer Freddy Mercury, followed by a trip to the Royal Vauxhall Tavern in the evening.To avoid being spotted, the princess dressed up as a \u201cbeautiful young man\u201d \u2013 and even managed to get a round of drinks in without being spotted.Designername has become synonymous with a certain Catherine, Princess of Wales, who\u2019s been wearing Packham\u2019s dresses since the early days of her marriage, from the short blue polka dots she wore coming out of hospital having given birth to Prince George, to the shimmering gold affair she wore for the \u201cNo Time to Die\u201d premiere.You\u2019ll find her ready-to-wear collection at her flagship store in Mayfair.In his memoir \u201cSpare,\u201d Prince Harry wrote about popping out to shop for clothes aton Kensington High Street, just a few minutes\u2019 walk from his home in Kensington Palace.This is, of course, the same chain as T.J. Maxx in the States \u2013 and does the same thing, selling designer brands at discount prices. There are branches scattered all over London, so you can pick up some clothes fit for a prince at a suitably pauper-ish price.Remember those famous photos of Princess Diana riding a log flume with William and Harry?They were taken at, a theme park about 25 miles west of London, where the family visited every year from 1991 to 1993, when the famous shots were taken.The royals didn\u2019t get any special treatment \u2013 they paid for entry and stood in line for the rides with everyone else.The ride in the photos, Logger\u2019s Leap, was the UK\u2019s highest log flume, but closed in 2015, and the theme park is now wanting to redevelop the area around it. Today\u2019s rides are rather more complex \u2013 like Stealth, which goes from zero to 80mph in just over two seconds.7 luxurious hotels loved by royaltyQueen Camilla revealed in anthat one of her favorite restaurants in her London youth was, a French bistrot straddling the central neighborhoods of Belgravia and Pimlico that\u2019s been going strong since 1962.You don\u2019t need to be on a royal budget to eat there, either \u2013 the prix fixe menus cost $44 for two courses, or $50 for three. Dishes are basic French classics, like onion tart, cassoulet stew and boeuf bourguignon.Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex, has long been a fan of the Soho House group of private members\u2019 clubs, and she\u2019s paid several visits to, its resort-style country outpost in Oxfordshire, including a trip with friends before her relationship with Prince Harry became public, and again abefore the wedding.Its 114 bedrooms are in the main farmhouse, plus privacy-aiding cabins and huts plonked in over 100 acres of countryside and even an artificial lake.The farmhouse is also home to a restaurant and Cowshed spa. Rooms cost from \u00a3335 per night, though they\u2019re incredibly sought after and availability is low. Non-members can technically book rooms at Soho House properties \u2013 but you need to take out a $130-per-year \u201cSoho Friends\u201d deal to book.Another Soho House outpost, 76 Dean Street is of course where Harry and Meghan had their first date in 2016 \u2013 a self-described sweaty prince who\u2019d been stuck in traffic turned up late to meet the woman of his dreams over cocktails \u2013 which, luckily, turned out just fine.While you have to be a member to go there, just a few doors down at number 69-71 is, also owned by the group but with a restaurant open to the public.On the menu: modern British done well, from fancy fish and chips to rump of lamb with cabbage and mint.has always been the hotel of choice for the Windsors \u2013 the Queen Mother used to come here for lunch, rumor has it the Queen herself was a low-key visitor, and the-then Kate Middleton used it as her bridal HQ for her 2011 wedding. It was just around from the in-laws for her \u2013 the hotel is just across the road from the back garden of Buckingham Palace.The only hotel in London to have a royal warrant \u2013 essentially an official vote of confidence from the family \u2013 it\u2019s still a refined kind of place, known for its excellent afternoon teas and its huge, semi-secret garden out the back, which is not quite as large as those at Buckingham Palace, but not bad for central London.With its nod-nod-wink-wink to former Italian premier Silvio Berlusconi\u2019s sleaze scandals,  Italian restaurantwas all the rage when it opened in Battersea, south London, in 2011.Harry was the first royal in \u2013 he was seen dancing in the street at 3 a.m. after spending the evening there in 2012 \u2013 and William and Kate paid a visit two years later, shortly after the arrival of Prince George.The Battersea branch is closed these days, but Bunga Bunga lives on in tourist-friendly Covent Garden, where it offers an \u201cimmersive dining experience\u201d with cabaret every Friday and Saturday night.The-then Meghan Markle was apparently spied In the heart of Chelsea while she was engaged to Prince Harry, getting a facial from.Chapman is facialist to the stars, with customers including celebs like Jourdan Dunn, Gigi Hadid, Victoria Beckham and Uma Thurman.She\u2019s known for her massages which drain excess fluid from the skin. Facials cost from \u00a3170 for an hour, or you can buy her products at her boutique behind Sloane Square.Emerging as flawless as the Duchess of Sussex is not guaranteed.Palaces, castles, chateaus: 12 regal staysAs royal patron of the All England Lawn Tennis Club, the Princess of Wales makes regular appearances in the Royal Box at Wimbledon during the annual two-week tennis championships \u2013 and she\u2019s usually joined by other members of the family.The club offersof the museum and grounds, including Centre Court, where the finals take place \u2013 and where the Royal Box is situated. Unfortunately you can\u2019t sit there for a photoshoot \u2013 only members of the club (and royals) have access, and plebeian posteriors are not permitted.On the plus side, you get behind-the-scenes access to the players\u2019 changing rooms \u2013 so you can take that Instagram shot on tennis royalty Roger Federer\u2019s usual bench instead.Both the Princess of Wales and the Duchess of Sussex have been spotted doing the superstore run \u2013 Kate has been snapped at a branch of well-to-do Waitrose, while Meghan was seen before her wedding stocking up at Whole Foods, the pricey US chain that has branches in the UK.Her local was the one on Kensington High Street \u2013 just opposite Harry\u2019s old shopping ground, T.K. Maxx.The most beautiful castles in WalesIn 2012, Queen Elizabeth II came to, London\u2019s poshest grocery store, to have afternoon tea with the-then Duchesses of Cornwall and Cambridge, to celebrate her 60 years on the throne.

        "text": "Editor\u2019s Note:is a CNN Travel series that spotlights some of the most fascinating topics in the travel world. As the UK crowns a new monarch, we\u2019re exploring all things royal, from castles to grand tours.The sleek, dark-gray lines of a F-16 Fighting Falcon jet, flanked by two other veterans of the Cold War skies, a French Dassault Mirage IV and a F-104 Starfighter, is not what you would usually expect to come across when walking into the courtyard of a 700-year-old French ch\u00e2teau.The conspicuous presence of this triad of combat aircraft in such an unlikely setting offers a foretaste of what this historical manor has in store for its guests.Ch\u00e2teau de Savigny-l\u00e8s-Beaune, in the little Burgundy village of the same name, dates back to the 14th century and would be just one more of the many wine-growing estates that dot this historical region of France was it not for the personal passions and initiative of one man, Michel Pont.A winegrower, car racer and avid collector, Pont bought the ch\u00e2teau in 1979 and over the following four decades, until his passing in 2021, turned it into a treasure trove for all those interested in mechanics and engineering.\u201cMy father raced Abarth cars for five years, between 1968 and 1973. He kept his cars and, at the same time, started collecting motorbikes too. The majority of them were acquired as scrap,\u201d says Christophe Pont, Michel\u2019s son and current owner and manager of the ch\u00e2teau.By the late 1970s Pont had already accumulated a significant collection of vehicles, comprising 10 Abarth racing cars and more than 300 vintage motorcycles. He was, however, just getting started. That initial batch of cars and motorcycles kept getting larger and larger and it soon started branching out.In the mid-1980s, Pont, who was ex-military, made inquiries with the French Air Force about the possibility of getting one of their decommissioned Mirage III fighter jets to exhibit at the ch\u00e2teau. The request was granted andsix months later what would become the kernel of thewas on its way to Savigny-l\u00e8s-Beaune.It\u2019s not an exaggeration to say that quite a few national aerospace museums would be envious of what\u2019s on display: around 100 aircraft of different makes and provenances all perfectly lined up in the grounds of the ch\u00e2teau.The list reads like a \u201cwho\u2019s who\u201d of 20th-century military aviation: several different versions of French Mirages and Myst\u00e8res, American F-100 series fighters and Soviet-made MiGs and Sukhois are among the many types of airplanes and helicopters you can find here.For years, Michel and Christophe Pont scouted the whole of Europe and beyond in order to expand their collection. Those aircraft they could procure were then dismantled and brought over to Ch\u00e2teau-Savigny to be reassembled on site.As the exhibits kept growing in size and scope, the word spread and the Pont family soon started to get offers to take in all sorts of machinery.Many of them eventually found their place at the chateau, which now boasts nine different exhibition areas ranging from satellites and space technology to tractors and wine-making equipment, in addition to the aforementioned collections of aircraft, Abarth racing cars and historical motorcycles.The US couple who bought a 48-room chateau in FranceIf the outdoor aircraft display is enough to get any aviation geek\u2019s heartbeat racing, the scope and diversity of the other collections can also be overwhelming at times.The whole scale of this extravaganza becomes ever more apparent as you visit the several pavilions scattered throughout the estate or slowly make your way through the ch\u00e2teau\u2019s halls and corridors.As you move from one room to the other, each seemingly packed to the hilt with thousands upon thousands of scale models of pretty much every conceivable type of aircraft that has ever flown and every make of car that has been produced, you stumble upon countless other interesting items, from ejector seats and fighter jet canopies to disassembled engines, strewn all over the place in an apparently random fashion.One of Ch\u00e2teau-Savigny\u2019s most colorful collections, in a literal sense, is perhaps the fire trucks, which was set up with the collaboration of Jean-Claude Picot, a friend of Pont Senior.Picot used to run a business building emergency vehicles and, upon his retirement, brought to the chateau his private fire truck collection, which shows the evolution of firefighting equipment throughout the whole of the 20th century.Then there\u2019s the room dedicated to naval matters. Remarkably for a place that is hundreds of miles from the sea, the ch\u00e2teau not only has a small naval exhibit, but is home also to several Bertin hovercraft. These were designed in the 1960s by Jean Bertin, a French engineer who is also credited for the development of the A\u00e9rotrain, a futuristic technology to run high-speed trains on an air cushion that slides over concrete tracks. The \u201cBertins\u201d were recovered by Pont from a scrap heap and brought over to the chateau where they now stand next to one of the property\u2019s vineyards.The pandemic shut down her chateau. Then she became a YouTube star\u201cAt the moment I am no longer looking to add museum pieces,\u201d Christophe Pont tells CNN, \u201cMy main goal is to preserve and continue the work of my father. I must ensure the continuity of the collections. It is with this goal in mind that I have resold some items. This has allowed me to purchase part of the collections from my brothers and has also given me the opportunity to trim the collections a bit in order to highlight some the most valuable pieces.\u201d His wish for the future is that \u201ctwenty years from now, our aircraft collection will be housed in an indoors museum that protects it from the weather.\u201dAll these many and varied interests have not prevented the Pont family from continuing to tend to the estate\u2019s vineyards. After all, the ch\u00e2teau\u2019s traditional line of business has always been, and continues to be, wine-making.While most of the 30,000 visitors the ch\u00e2teau gets every year are attracted by its unique collections, there is also an offering for those interested in plain and simple wine tourism.With the Bourgogne wine region boasting up to 84 designations of origin for wine (\u201cAppellations d\u2019Origine Contr\u00f4l\u00e9es\u201d or AOC, in French), including, it shouldn\u2019t come as a surprise that Ch\u00e2teau-Savigny has also its own wine-tasting rooms and shop as well.Regardless of the reason that brings you to this corner of rural France, better set aside some time in your schedule, because this most eclectic of French ch\u00e2teaux is guaranteed to keep you busy for a good while."

Get news about destinations opening, inspiration for future adventures, plus the latest in aviation, food and drink, where to stay and other travel developments.Everywhere you look on Santorini, you\u2019re reminded that you\u2019re on a volcano. The lunar landscapes, the black and red beaches, the pebbles made of solidified lava. The Greek island\u2019s transfixing beauty is a result of the area\u2019s violent volcanic history.Santorini is of course famous for its breathtaking crescent-shaped caldera, half of which is submerged \u2013 making it the only sunken caldera in the world. It was created by one of the largest known eruptions around 3,600 years ago. The explosion was so powerful that it wrecked Santorini\u2019s ancient city of Akrotiri and dealt a fatal blow to the seafaring Minoan civilization, which had settled on the island at the time.Today, Santorini \u2013 also known as Thira \u2013 is Greece\u2019s foremost romantic playground with luxurious villas and resorts providing pampered getaways for A-listers and dreamlike settings for lavish weddings and photoshoots alike. The island\u2019s steep volcanic cliffs, perched about 1,000 feet above sea level, create an impressive geological canvas with whitewashed houses balanced on the edge. No wonder it\u2019s one of the most photographed locations on the planet.Every evening, the island comes to a grinding halt for Santorini\u2019s world-famous sunsets. The blue and white domed village of Oia gets packed as the golden hour draws in. As the sun begins to set behind the caldera\u2019s cliffs, the sky transforms into a vivid display of red, orange, and pink hues. Thousands gasp as the last rays disappear in the sea.Few realize that beneath the hypnotic kaleidoscope of colors lies an active volcano.Santorini is part of the Hellenic Volcanic Arc, one of the most important volcanic fields in Europe which has seen over 100 eruptions over the past 400,000 years. The East Mediterranean\u2019s most active underwater, and potentially dangerous, volcano, Kolumbo, is five miles northeast of Santorini and part of the same volcanic system.Submerged in the Aegean Sea, Kolumbo has been quiet for nearly 400 years \u2013 but it is not asleep. The last time it erupted, in 1650, it killed 70 people and triggered a 40 foot tsunami. Strong earthquakes and aftershocks were recorded, along with toxic gas and plumes of smoke.Scientists know Kolumbo exploding could cause great havoc. Some of the world\u2019s biggest oceanographical expeditions have paid it a visit and monitoring has increased in the last 20 years. One of the largest US research vessels, thedeep drilling ship, traveled to Santorini for its first Mediterranean mission between December 2022 and February 2023.Greek islands: How to choose the right one for your holidayThe formidable ship brought \u201can entire floating lab to the area,\u201d says volcanologist and expedition co-chief Tim Druitt. Able to drill at over 8,000 meters (26,000 feet) beneath the surface of the sea, researchers collected previously unreached sediments to try and reconstruct the history of volcanism in the area.The results \u2013 initial reports are expected later this year \u2013 should help scientists not only predict future eruptions, but also to reveal the behavior of other active volcanoes around the world that pose a threat to millions who live in their vicinity. The links between earthquakes and volcanoes are also being studied.Evi Nomikou, a geological oceanographer at the University of Athens, has taken part in every expedition on her native Santorini for the last 20 years. \u201cWe are gradually putting together a geopuzzle [showing] which parts were [originally] land, which parts were water,\u201d she says.\u201cIf we can better understand past eruptions and their impact, we have a roadmap to better address future challenges.\u201dThe JOIDES Resolution expedition isn\u2019t the first major study of the area. Nomikou says that the long-studied extreme conditions found at Kolumbo led NASA to fund a groundbreaking expedition in 2019. \u201cAt the bottom of its crater there is an extra-terrestrial ocean with life forms that can be found on other planets.\u201dThe hostile environment, with its active hydrothermal vents spewing hot water and minerals, served as an ideal testing ground for new state-of-the-art technologies using Autonomous Underwater Vehicles. NASA tested submersibles that one day, it hopes, will be exploring alien oceans on moons of Jupiter and Saturn.Anotheralso uncovered a previously undetected magma chamber beneath Kolumbo. Scientists believe that the chamber may also be key to understanding the seismic activity in this region.Greece's Mykonos says it's ready to party like before CovidFuming volcanoes and bubbling craters also fired the imagination of Hollywood producers who chose Santorini as the opening location of adrenaline-pumped 2003 Hollywood blockbuster \u201cLara Croft: Tomb Raider \u2013 The Cradle of Life.\u201d Using Santorini\u2019s dramatic cliffs as a backdrop, Angelina Jolie found herself in hazardous situations in mysterious waters while looking for underwater treasure.Jolie and then-husband Brad Pitt spent vacation time on Santorini following the shoot, and they\u2019re not the only ones. The Kardashians, Lady Gaga and Shakira are among the celebrities who have splashed in Santorini\u2019s crystal-clear waters. Every summer, mega yachts cruise back and forth between Santorini and Greece\u2019s other celebrity magnet, the party island of Mykonos, their VIP passengers revealing their exclusive surroundings in glitzy posts.Brangelina\u2019s romance may be over, but Lara Croft\u2019s adventurous spirit lives on in tourist boat excursions. They include a visit to the volcano of Nea Kameni: one of five islands that form the Santorini volcanic complex, and ain itself.\u201cThe last eruption on Nea Kameni was in the 1950s,\u201d says Marios Fytros, CEO of travel agency Santorini View. \u201cVisitors love the thrill of hiking up to the crater of a volcano. It is one of our most popular excursions.\u201d Boat tours continue with a swim at volcanic hot springs on nearby Palea Kameni island, followed by sundowners on deck facing Santorini\u2019s cliffs.Another popular tour, to the magnificent archaeological site of Akrotiri, serves as a sober reminder of volcanic force. The thriving Bronze Age city was destroyed by the eruption 3,600 years ago, which spewed out a nearly 20-mile high column of ash and rock, entombing the city. Some 1,700 years later, a similar disaster would destroy Pompeii.With the ashes and lava removed, Akrotiri\u2019s vividly colored frescoes today stand beautifully preserved.Thanks to its global fame, Santorini has seen some the biggest tourism investments in the country. Hilton and Nobu are among the brands to have arrived on the island in the past few years, and property prices are among the highest in Greece.Yet geologists \u2013 who are\u2013 warn that it\u2019s just a matter of time before a big eruption hits again.Can wine help save Greece's Santorini from too much tourism?However, \u201ctime\u201d in geology years can be ultra-slow. So much so that one real estate agent on the island, who declined to be named, says that \u201cvolcanic activity never enters the conversation\u201d when selling a property.When it does erupt, Kolumbo is capable of producing an eruption column tens of miles high and is also liable to trigger a tsunami. Increased activity about 10 years ago raised concerns but it has since subsided.\u201cIf we start seeing increased activity in Kolumbo then we need to be alert, says Druitt. \u201cThe good news is that volcanoes do give plenty of warning.\u201dMeanwhile, in 2020, Greece\u2019s Civil Protection Agency unveiled a 185-page plan forof Santorini\u2019s volcanic group.In their everyday life, locals have little time to think about the volcano beyond  excursions. In summer, the island is packed.remains one of the  biggest challenges as Santorini\u2019s unique morphology continues to bring in the crowds. Last year the International Union of Geological Sciences, in collaboration with UNESCO, included the caldera of Santorini in its first list of top.Beyond hotels and restaurants, all business on the island is linked to the volcano. Locally made cosmetics are packed with minerals, and premium food ingredients are grown in unique soil. There is a museum dedicated to the Santorini cherry tomato, a Protected Designation of Origin product since 2006, and the island\u2019s fava beans are considered the best in Greece.Then there is Santorini\u2019s most famous export after tourism:. Islanders say there\u2019s more wine than water on Santorini.About a fifth of the nearly 30 square mile island is taken up by vineyards, most of which grow, a native grape which produces white wines that are crisp, dry and \u2013 unsurprisingly \u2013 mineral.The traditional \u201ccave\u201d houses dug into the volcanic rocks, called yposkafa, are prime nesting grounds for honeymooners seeking their dream vacation. But for Nomikou, who grew up on Santorini, it was Kolumbo that featured in her childhood dreams.\u201cI was greatly influenced by my grandfather\u2019s and great grandfather\u2019s stories. They remembered the smaller explosions at Nea Kameni,\u201d she says.\u201cBut they insisted that the one to worry about is \u2018the one you can\u2019t see\u2019.\u201d\u201cGradually I realized there was another volcano, under water. A volcano more powerful, mysterious and dangerous. It is impossible to know if any of us will live through a big eruption but, at some point, there will be one.\u201dSantorini could one day be buried under a layer of ash once more. But for now \u2013 as visitors enjoy another stunning sunset over a glass of assyrtiko \u2013 the volcano keeps quiet."

        "text": "Editor\u2019s Note:Sign up forCNN Travel\u2019s weekly newsletter. Get news about destinations opening, inspiration for future adventures, plus the latest in aviation, food and drink, where to stay and other travel developments.On January 21, 1976 a teenage John Tye was among crowds of onlookers clinging to a chain link fence, cheering as the first commercial British Airways Concorde flight departed from London\u2019s Heathrow airport.Tye was exhilarated, amazed and inspired as he saw this sleek, supersonic airplane of the future climb into the skies and make history.Little did Tye know some 20 years later, he\u2019d be sitting in the Concorde flight deck for the first time, pinching himself that his teenage dream was coming true.Tye vividly recalls his first moments flying Concorde. Sure, he\u2019d gone through extensive training, he\u2019d practiced on the simulator \u2013 but this was the real deal. It was a feeling he could never have fully prepared for.Tye and his fellow training pilots were in Seville, Spain. It was a beautiful Thursday evening \u2013 \u201cthe sun was just setting, you could see a big ball of fire at the end of runway,\u201d as Tye puts it.\u201cWe got in and started the engines, and to feel those four Rolls-Royce Olympus engines starting up and the airplane vibration for the very first time was just absolutely mind blowing,\u201d Tye tellsTye synchronized his watch with the training captain and the flight engineer. Then, they counted down and prepared for takeoff.\u201cIt\u2019s \u2018three, two, one \u2013 now,\u2019 and I pushed all four throttles fully forward in my left hand and I was just shoved back into my seat \u2013 an experience I could never describe, the acceleration as you shot off down the runway,\u201d he says.Then, the Concorde was in the air, building height.\u201cThat 20 minutes was the most incredible experience in my aviation career. It was just absolutely unbelievable,\u201d says Tye.For nearly three decades before it retired in November 2003, Concorde aircraft sped through the skies above the Atlantic in just under three and a half hours, flying at twice the speed of sound.Most of us can only imagine what it was like to be on board \u2013 after all, these aircraft were small, with room for just 100 passengers per flight, and ticket prices were steep.If comparatively few people experienced what it was like to travel on Concorde, even fewer know the feeling of piloting the fastest passenger plane ever to enter commercial service.British Airways and Air France were the only two airlines who operated the aircraft. It\u2019s said that during the aircraft\u2019s 27 years of service, there were more qualified American astronauts than there were British Airways Concorde pilots.When Tye first piloted Concorde in the late 1990s, the airplane had been established for two decades. Peter Duffey was there at the very beginning, as one of the first British Airways pilots selected to trial the aircraft.\u201cI was involved in the development \u2013 flying with the test pilots,\u201d Duffey tells CNN Travel. \u201cWe flew to Australia and Canada, carrying a lot of passengers.\u201dDuffey, who is now in his 90s, learned to fly as an Royal Air Force pilot during World War II. He later flew the de Havilland Comet, the first turbo jet engine aircraft, and one of its successors, the de Havilland Comet 4. When Concorde came calling, Duffey was an established British Airways training pilot on the Boeing 707.\u201cWe knew Concorde was coming, and most people felt intrigued and wanted to get onto the aircraft. So I put my name down for it,\u201d he recalls.Duffey helped mastermind the first Concorde training scheme, and flew the aircraft until he retired in 1980.Also there at the beginning was pilot Jock Lowe, who shares a birthday with Concorde \u2013 he turned 25 the day Concorde first took to the skies in 1969.Lowe remembers watching the aircraft on television that day.\u201cI thought to myself, \u2018Yeah, that\u2019s what I\u2019ll do. I\u2019ll go and fly Concorde \u2013 not really realizing what was involved,\u2019\u201d Lowe tells CNN Travel.Like Duffey, Lowe was one of the first British Airways pilots to test out supersonic flying at RAF Fairford, a military airbase in southwest England.\u201cIt was quite a shock because I walked around the hangar on a foggy February morning at RAF Fairford \u2013 and I\u2019d never even seen the aeroplane for real before,\u201d says Lowe.\u201dAn hour later, Lowe says he was \u201clet loose\u201d with the Concorde, and it felt \u201camazing.\u201d\u201cWe went up to about 63,000 feet and started to throw the aeroplane around,\u201d he recalls. Lowe says the feeling, an analogy often echoed in Concorde circles, was \u201clike going from a bus to a Formula One sports car.\u201dLowe ended up on the first BA training course in 1976 and was still on the Concorde fleet when he retired in 2001, earning him the accolade of the longest-serving British Airways Concorde pilot.\u201cI flew it for longer than anyone else, by quite a margin. But, because I had lots of office jobs as well, I didn\u2019t do as many hours as some of them,\u201d says Lowe, who also served as BA\u2019s flight operations director.Concorde's last flight: Is this the greatest aviation photograph of all time?Richard Westray, who first piloted Concorde in 1998, echoes Lowe\u2019s \u201cbus to Ferrari\u201d comparison. He says commanding a Concorde was unlike the feeling of flying any other aircraft.\u201cRacing down the runway for the first time, accelerating to climb into the air was one of those experiences you never forget,\u201d Westray tells CNN Travel. \u201cThe feeling of speed during acceleration phases was just tremendous. The plane performed like no subsonic plane could perform.\u201dOnce the Concorde was in the air, it would climb fast, \u201cat 100 knots faster than an ordinary subsonic jet,\u201d as former Concorde First Officer Tony Yule explains.\u201cYou would probably climb somewhere around 2,000-4,000 feet a minute, which is really very, very fast, until initially you hit 28,000 feet,\u201d he tells CNN Travel.Concorde couldn\u2019t fly supersonic over land, so after the initial ascent, it would operate subsonically \u2013 although the velocity was still \u201cwell over the speed of a 747,\u201d as John Tye explains.When Concorde reached the Bristol Channel, an inlet to the west of London leading to the North Atlantic, pilots would give passengers a heads up and then the aircraft would break through the sound barrier.There was, says Tye, \u201cno banging, no crashing, no rattling and rolling.\u201dYule describes the moment the Concorde hit Mach 1 as \u201crather like putting a hot knife through warm butter \u2013 it slips in just like that.\u201dThe feeling of speed during acceleration phases was just tremendous. The plane performed like no subsonic plane could perform.Richard Westray, former Concorde pilotBut the subsequent shock wave would create a tiny blip that would briefly impact the instruments.\u201cThe vertical speed indicators in the flight deck would do a little dance as the supersonic shockwave passed over their external sensors,\u201d explains Tye.That, says Yule, is how you\u2019d \u201cknow you\u2019re supersonic.\u201dThen the pilots would make an announcement to passengers. \u201cLadies and gentlemen, we\u2019ve just reached the speed of sound, Mach 1. Welcome to the world of supersonic flight.\u201d\u201cAnd then we\u2019re up to twice the speed of sound and nearly 60,000 feet on the \u2018edge of space,\u2019\u201d says Tye.Tye distinctly remembers that moment on his first-ever Concorde flight.\u201cI saw that curvature of the Earth, and the black sky above us, leading to infinity,\u201d he recalls.As for Lowe, he spent nearly three decades flying Concorde, but he says the feeling of \u201cexhilaration\u201d at the aircraft\u2019s technological marvels never really faded.\u201cThe tension, the excitement of the first flights, of the first year, it gradually reduced, obviously, but it never lost its excitement,\u201d says Lowe. \u201cIt was always exhilarating.\u201dIt was also, he says, always \u201cfun.\u201d The atmosphere on board was always electric.\u201cEverybody that worked with it, from the hangar floor upwards, everybody had a great deal of pride in the aeroplane and getting it right,\u201d says Lowe.The small pool of Concorde pilots also meant everyone knew everyone. Operating other aircraft, you\u2019d rarely fly with the same team, but with Concorde, there were always familiar faces in the crew, says Tye.\u201cThere were only ever 134 BA Concorde pilots the whole time the airplane was in service, so it really was a day out with your mates every time you went to work,\u201d he says.Around 20 minutes after take off, cabin crew would start serving the passengers. Many of them were frequent flyers, business people \u201ccommuting\u201d back and forth across the Atlantic. The crew would recognize familiar faces and know their drink of choice by heart.After providing for the passengers, the crew would pop into the cockpit.\u201cThey came in with three mugs of tea for each of us \u2013 the captain on the left, me and the flight engineer sitting behind,\u201d recalls Tye.So far, so standard. But there was a Concorde twist.\u201cAlso on the same tray were three pots of some of the finest caviar in the world with a mother of pearl spoon each to eat them with.\u201dThe Concorde\u2019s supersonic status also afforded pilots a vantage point like no other.\u201cBy the time you\u2019re at 60,000 feet, you could see a quarter of a million square miles,\u201d says Lowe. \u201cSo you could actually see the things that you saw on maps \u2013 there they were, for real.\u201dFor Tye, it was also surreal to take off and land and see crowds of people lined up to watch. It would take him back to the day he stood at Heathrow, watching the first commercial Concorde flight take off.On one occasion, Tye remembers an American Airlines pilot who was cleared to line up and takeoff before Concorde asking if he could skip his place in line, so that he could watch Concorde depart instead.\u201cTo operate a Concorde out of Heathrow was just incredible, you could feel the eyes of the other passengers in the subsonic airliners around you at Heathrow watching you, you could feel the pilots of those other airliners watching you,\u201d says Tye. \u201cAnd here I was, taxiing Concorde out, towards runway 27R at Heathrow.\u201dWhat it was really like to fly on ConcordeBefore the flight deck was closed to travelers post-9/11, Concorde\u2019s on board philosophy was \u201ca very big private jet that was being shared by up to 100 passengers,\u201d as Westray puts it. \u201cSo we had very much an open flight deck policy.\u201dThe majority of the passengers were business people, and the remaining 20% were the rich, famous and important. Westray recalls showing Sting the flight deck on more than one occasion. It was surreal, but mingling with celebrities was part and parcel of working on Concorde.\u201cThe very first big name I met \u2013 I walked out, opened the curtain into the cabin, and there was Elton John sitting there in the front row,\u201d recalls Tye.Tye recalls being stunned by how bizarre the moment was: \u201cI\u2019d been to Wembley Stadium to see him with 100,000 other people in concert just a few weeks before.\u201dTye and John had a brief interaction but Tye can\u2019t recall any of it. \u201cI was too starstruck to be honest with you,\u201d he admits.After that, Tye made a mental note to himself that, before heading out to greet passengers on future flights, he\u2019d first check \u201cif any of my other heroes were out there,\u201d so he could be more prepared.This strategy served him well \u2013 he later met superstars Mick Jagger and Paul McCartney.As for Lowe, over his decades-spanning Concorde career he transported everyone from Muhammad Ali to Richard Nixon \u2013 \u201cmany people I would have never, ever, ever dreamed of meeting \u2013 pop stars, film stars, businessmen to royalty.\u201dAs well as scheduled flights, Concorde also flew charter flights for the VIPs.The main difference with these flights, says Lowe, was \u201cthere was obviously just a little bit more tension and pressure to make sure that the aeroplane left on time and arrived on time.\u201dHe recalls one occasion when he was flying Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip from Canada back to the UK.\u201cWe had to slow down because the temperature in the upper atmosphere meant that we\u2019d reached the limits,\u201d explains Lowe.The Queen noticed, and asked Lowe what was going on \u2013 why was the aircraft slowing down?The interaction, says Lowe, was \u201cquite fun.\u201d\u201cI was able to explain a little bit \u2013 that we weren\u2019t slowed down much, and we\u2019d still arrive on time.\u201dSure enough, they did.What happened when a 94-year-old former flight attendant saw a photo of herself at the airportThe Concorde story ended in November 2003, when the last commercial flight landed in a Bristol airfield.There were a number of factors leading to Concorde\u2019s retirement in 2003.In 2000, a fatal Air France Concorde accident led to an investigation and various modifications to the aircraft.Westray suggests that while the plane had an otherwise glowing safety record, some passengers never regained confidence in Concorde.He remembers meeting a former Concorde frequent flyer at New York\u2019s JFK airport not long after the crash. This passenger was checking onto a Boeing 747 flight instead.\u201cHe apologized to me and said, \u2018I\u2019ll never fly Concorde again,\u2019\u201d recalls Westray. \u201cHe said, \u2018I\u2019m frightened of it.\u2019\u201dConcorde was very reliant on these regular customers who crossed the Atlantic frequently for work. Westray and Lowe say several Concorde frequent flyers worked in the World Trade Center and were killed on 9/11. These terrorist attacks also impacted global confidence in air travel more generally.And by the early 21st century, Concorde was getting old, and there were significant costs involved in the aircraft\u2019s upkeep.\u201cI wasn\u2019t surprised it was retired, they kept it going as long as possible,\u201d says Duffey. \u201cBut the maintenance costs were very large.\u201d\u201cIt was going to have to go sometime,\u201d agrees Lowe. \u201cI think it was a little premature, but it would have stopped when the banking crisis came along in 2008, because we\u2019d have lost half our passengers.\u201dTye says his Concorde career came to an end without him realizing. In August 2000, he was about to take off at Heathrow when he got a call telling him to return Concorde to the gate because BA was grounding the aircraft.\u201cWhat I didn\u2019t know then was I wouldn\u2019t ever get back on Concorde,\u201d says Tye. \u201cBecause of that, I didn\u2019t have any mementos. I didn\u2019t have any significant souvenirs, and I was planning to carry on flying Concorde for the rest of my career.\u201dWhile Concorde did return for a couple of years before its final goodbye, in the interim, Tye became a BA Airbus captain and never returned to supersonic flying.Concorde\u2019s final flight was, for Tye, a \u201ca very, very sad, emotional day.\u201d\u201cIt was a very emotional period, a lot of tears were shed,\u201d echoes Westray, recalling an \u201cemotional farewell\u201d from air traffic control on his final Concorde flight from New York in 2003.When Concorde ended, Westray was grateful he was still young, and could train on another big aircraft and continue his aviation career.It never lost its excitement. It was always exhilarating.Jock Lowe, former Concorde pilotBut other Concorde employees were out of their jobs \u2013 particularly the flight engineers. When Concorde launched, this was a key aviation job, but by the early 21st century the role was becoming obsolete thanks to advances in technology.Lowe was among the Concorde pilots who retired when the plane was grounded.\u201cIt was a point of reflection,\u201d says Lowe of this period. \u201cI wasn\u2019t totally sure that it would come back \u2013 even though I had absolute confidence in the aeroplane.\u201dAs for Tye, he carried on piloting British Airways aircraft until 2022. As the years went on and the numbers of still-serving former Concorde pilots dwindled, Tye was increasingly peppered with questions about his supersonic days.\u201cYou weren\u2019t a celebrity, but you were known as a Concorde pilot,\u201d he says.On flights, he\u2019d regularly be quizzed by a younger co-pilot keen to know all about Tye\u2019s time flying supersonic.Tye always enjoyed these trips down memory lane.\u201cI\u2019d be delighted to share my passion and privilege with them and tell them all about it \u2013 and I\u2019d try and get it right and know when to shut up and not hog the limelight.\u201dThere were only ever two female Concorde pilots: British Airways\u2019 Barbara Harmer, who passed away in 2011, and AirFrance\u2019s B\u00e9atrice Vialle, who still works for the French airline.Tye knew Hammer and says she was \u201cabsolutely wonderful.\u201dWhile aviation is still known for being a predominantly male, predominantly White industry, Tye says he\u2019s heartened to see progress in the two decades since Concorde\u2019s final flight.\u201cWe are definitely becoming more diverse,\u201d he says.Traveling the world as one of the first Black Pan Am flight attendantsAlmost two decades since Concorde\u2019s final flight, the allure of supersonic flight hasn\u2019t waned, with companies such as Boom SupersonicThe former Concorde pilots have mixed views on the likelihood of supersonic flight\u2019s return.Lowe cites the roadblocks of \u201cthe cost of development, the cost of materials, the cost of fuel.\u201dTye reckons it\u2019s \u201csomething that could definitely happen again,\u201d but points out engines would need to be quieter and more fuel efficient.\u201cWe couldn\u2019t have Concorde engines now, they\u2019re far too noisy and use far too much fuel,\u201d he says.Westray says it \u201ccould be a reality, but I think it\u2019s a lot further away than people think.\u201dBut one thing he is confident about \u2013 there will always be forward-thinking aviation development happening somewhere, somehow.\u201cScientists and aviation enthusiasts never stop and they\u2019ll always be people pushing to expand the envelope,\u201d he says.Today, Tye says he\u2019s just grateful to have had the opportunity to fulfill his teenage dream. Piloting Concorde was an incredible job and every morning, he\u2019d wake up excited and thankful.\u201cMost of the people in my street would be walking off to the station with their briefcases, and I\u2019d be getting in my car to drive to the airport to fly Concorde to New York. So that was just a thrill and an excitement every day when I went to work.\u201dCorrection: An earlier version of this story misidentified the RAF base from which Concorde test flights were flown."

        "name": "Two strangers met on the River Nile. They\u2019ve been married for 25 years",
        "link": "https://edition.cnn.com/travel/article/chance-encounters-egypt-river-nile/index.html",
        "text": "Christina Ward had only known Wahid Kandil for six months when he asked her to marry him.The couple were sitting on a bench overlooking the River Nile one evening, the ancient Temple of Luxor illuminated behind them.Wahid turned to Christina. \u201cSo, are we getting married or what?\u201d he asked.Christina almost laughed. The question was somehow both out of nowhere and long-awaited.Since meeting as colleagues on a Nile tour boat, Christina, from the UK, and Wahid, from Egypt, had spent every moment they could together.\u201cTo be able to say I fell in love while sailing down the Nile under the moon and stars sounds very romantic but that\u2019s exactly what happened,\u201d Christina tellstoday.Christina had arrived in Egypt in October 1996, spurred on by her self-described \u201citchy feet.\u201d She was 28 and desperate to see the world, so the six month stint as an Egypt-based tour guide for an adventure travel company seemed like the perfect opportunity. She\u2019d essentially be paid to travel. Plus, she loved Egypt and was fascinated by the country\u2019s ancient history.As tour leader, Christina was responsible for shepherding groups of 25 travelers on two-week-long trips around the country.\u201cWe\u2019d visit Luxor, Aswan, Hurghada and Cairo and do lots of side trips like riding donkeys at sunrise to the Valley of the Kings, riding camels into abandoned monasteries in the desert, dinner at Nubian family homes,\u201d recalls Christina.Part of each trip took place on what Christina calls \u201cthe backpackers boat of the Nile.\u201dThis was the Kimo, a small tour boat home to a series of bunk bed-filled cabins, where Christina and her charges would sleep while on board, as well as a dining room and a sundeck, where raucous parties would take place as the boat sailed down the river.On her first night in Egypt, Christina introduced herself to the Kimo\u2019s crew. She wanted to establish a good rapport with her new colleagues. She was especially keen to meet the boat\u2019s manager, 26-year-old Wahid Kandil, as they\u2019d be working closely together. As manager, it was Wahid\u2019s job to ensure everything on board ran smoothly \u2013 which often it didn\u2019t \u2013 as well as look after the crew, provisions, budget and help Christina ensure the tourists had a good time.Cairo-born Wahid had previously put a degree in horticulture to use as an agriculture engineer on a large farm in the desert, but he found working on the tour boat way more fun. Wahid enjoyed meeting people from across the world \u2013 and he still embraced his love of gardening when he took tourists on side trips to the islands dotted down the Nile, teaching them about local plant species.On her second evening in Egypt, Christina found herself sitting next to Wahid outside one of the Kimo\u2019s cabins. The two smoked together and \u201chad a bit of a flirt\u201d as Chirstina puts it.She liked Wahid right away, and later that evening scribbled a line or two about him in her diary.Wahid liked Christina too, but he was wary. In his time working on the Kimo, he\u2019d noticed a trend \u2013 young women would turn up from the UK to temporarily work in Egypt tourism and enjoy a brief fling with a local. He felt like they were looking for Egyptian boyfriends more for the sake of novelty than anything else, so he usually steered well clear of boat romances.\u201cI always kind of rejected that,\u201d he says today.But as the days rolled on, Wahid and Christina gravitated towards one another. Sure, they were both busy with the tours \u2013 and there was no privacy on the Kimo, so there was \u201cno deep conversation,\u201d as Wahid puts it. But they stole every chance they could to chat and flirt.From day one, Christina loved working as a tour guide. She enjoyed traveling around Egypt, but she especially loved the days spent on board the Kimo.\u201cSailing on the Nile is magical,\u201d she says.One evening, Christina dropped her tour group off for dinner on land in the Egyptian city of Aswan. Then she popped back onto the boat to see if she could catch Wahid. She spotted him, wandered over to say hello, and asked what he was doing later.\u201cI didn\u2019t mean anything by it,\u201d Christina says today.\u201cYes you did,\u201d says Wahid, laughing.\u201cWell, maybe I was flirting a bit,\u201d admits Christina.Wahid said he was around that evening, and so he and Christina arranged to meet up at a nearby hotel bar. But then Christina was summoned back to her tour guide duties, and she ended up being 45 minutes late to the date. She had no way of contacting Wahid to let him know, as neither had cell phones. So, after finishing up work, headed to the hotel as fast as she could.\u201cWhen I walked in, he had a face like absolute thunder,\u201d says Christina.Wahid was standing by reception, writing a note for his would-be date, which he intended to leave with the staff.\u201cIt was quite an angry note,\u201d Wahid says, recalling that he\u2019d written: \u201cNobody\u2019s ever stood me up like this.\u201dBut when Christina explained her tardiness was out of her hands, Wahid relented. The two went inside together and found a table on the bar terrace. They were at the, a five-star establishment on the banks of the river, famous for being the spot where English crime writer Agatha Christie wrote her detective novel \u201cDeath on the Nile.\u201d\u201cIt was a really beautiful terrace \u2013 very romantic, looking over the Nile,\u201d says Christina. \u201cIt was just amazing.\u201d\u201cBut very expensive,\u201d adds Wahid. He didn\u2019t tell Christina at the time, but the cost of their multiple drinks and snacks ate up a significant proportion of his monthly salary.Still, at that moment, he didn\u2019t care. He was just happy to spend time with Christina \u2013 especially because their conversation that night moved beyond the boat-based, flirtatious back and forth to something deeper.To be able to say I fell in love while sailing down the Nile under the moon and stars sounds very romantic but that\u2019s exactly what happenedChristina Kandil\u201cThat was the first time that we really talked about a wide range of things,\u201d says Wahid.They discussed their thoughts on family, faith and their life goals.\u201cI think it clicked that we really get along very, very well,\u201d says Wahid.\u201cIt was a late night,\u201d says Christina.The next day, the two were back to work on the Kimo and the glow of the night before slightly faded when they had a bit of a workplace \u201cpower struggle,\u201d as Christina puts it.Wahid planned an unscheduled boat stop and Christina questioned the logistics of the decision \u2013 she was worried the tour was running late.\u201cI\u2019m standing there going, \u2018You can\u2019t do this!\u2019 So we ended up having a little bit of a power tussle, which is quite funny,\u201d she recalls.It was a little heated, but still light-hearted. It was obvious that, even when they were arguing, Christina and Wahid enjoyed each other\u2019s company.Still, neither of them thought that the burgeoning relationship would go anywhere.From Christina\u2019s point of view, her time in Egypt had an end date and therefore so did her relationship with Wahid. After working in Egypt, she planned to spend six months as a tour guide in Turkey.\u201cI thought, \u2018This is just my first trip. This is just six months in Egypt, and I\u2019m going on somewhere else afterwards, so this is just a temporary thing,\u2019\u201d says Christina.As for Wahid, he had other pressures weighing on his mind. Shortly before Christina came into his life, Wahid\u2019s mother had been diagnosed with cancer. This news had upturned his world, leading him to question every part of his life.\u201cMy mum obviously was a very part important of my life,\u201d he says. \u201cI was quite torn at that time. It was very rough.\u201dWhen he first learned of his mother\u2019s illness, Wahid was in a new relationship. While he knew it didn\u2019t make sense, he\u2019d come to associate this girlfriend with his mother\u2019s diagnosis, and subsequently ended things between them.\u201cIt\u2019s a superstition, if you will \u2014 she\u2019d brought this plague into my life, I thought she was bad news, so I kind of ignored her, ghosted her, and that was it,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd then Christina came, and I fell for her.\u201dAt first, Wahid didn\u2019t tell Christina about this very recent ex-girlfriend. But of course Christina eventually found out, and she felt misled and angry.When this news leaked, the couple happened to be on board another ship on the Nile. The Kimo had unexpectedly broken down, and so the adventure travel company had chartered some cabins on a large, luxurious cruise ship.Feeling hurt and betrayed, Christina ignored Wahid for the rest of the day and focused her attention on the cruise ship\u2019s manager, with the aim of making Wahid jealous. She succeeded, with Wahid panicking he\u2019d lost Christina forever.As they argued over what had happened, both Christina and Wahid recognized for the first time that their feelings for one another ran deep. Their respective jealous reactions spoke volumes \u2013 this wasn\u2019t just a fling. This was real.\u201cThat was probably the catalyst and the turning point,\u201d says Christina.From there, both Christina and Wahid decided: \u201cThis is serious, and we\u2019re going to take this further.\u201dTwo strangers met walking the Camino de Santiago. Just weeks later they were engagedThat\u2019s how the couple came to be sitting by the Nile in Luxor, talking about the prospect of marriage.By then, Christina was certain she and Wahid would share a future. But there were a lot of unknowns in this equation. Where would they live? What would their families think? Should they wait a bit longer before jumping into commitment?\u201cI didn\u2019t say yes, didn\u2019t say no \u2013 I ummed and ahhed what to do,\u201d says Christina.She questioned whether she should go back to the UK for a while, to \u201clogically remove myself and see if this is the right thing to do.\u201dBut when it came to it, Christina couldn\u2019t bring herself to go back.\u201cI just knew I couldn\u2019t leave Egypt without him,\u201d she says.Christina was with a tour group in Cairo when she made the decision. It had been a long, stressful day, and she found herself wishing that Wahid was there by her side.\u201cI am \u2018Miss Independent\u2019 and I\u2019m strong, and I can stand up for myself. But every now and again, I want someone to stand up for me,\u201d she says.\u201cAnd so I just walked across to this payphone, picked it up, called him and I said, \u2018Right, what date are we getting married?\u2019 And we literally planned it a week after that tour finished.\u201dGetting married, says Wahid, was a promise that \u201cthis is the person you want to spend your life with.\u201dFor both Christina and Wahid, marriage was the start of a new chapter. They decided they wouldn\u2019t live in Egypt, and they wouldn\u2019t live in England either \u2013 they\u2019d start afresh, somewhere new.\u201cWe both wanted to start a new life somewhere together,\u201d says Christina. \u201cWe just knew we wanted to do it together.\u201dWahid\u2019s family were encouraging, telling him he had to do what was right for him \u2013 although one of his sisters did voice some concerns.Meanwhile, Christina called her mother back in the UK. \u201cYou need to come to Egypt to visit,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s someone I want you to meet.\u201dWhen Christina\u2019s mother met Wahid, she knew right away.\u201cYou\u2019re going to marry him, aren\u2019t you?\u201d she said on the first evening of her trip, tearing up.\u201cShe very much had the attitude that East and West \u2013 it\u2019s not going to work,\u201d says Christina. \u201cI was angry and upset at first, and then she was stuck on a boat with us for two whole days. That was interesting. But she came around a bit, for sure.\u201dWahid jokes he \u201cbribed her\u201d by cooking up some great food.\u201cLooking back on it, you do realize it\u2019s all coming from a place of love and concern, that\u2019s all,\u201d says Christina.\u201cI don\u2019t think it was a nasty resistance,\u201d agrees Wahid.Perhaps more worrying was the reaction Christina received from the British Embassy in Egypt. She recalls contacting them to discuss visas and being immediately counseled against marrying Wahid, with officials saying he was likely using her to get a British passport.But Christina and Wahid ignored these naysayers and a wedding date was set: April 26, 1997.They planned to keep the celebrations \u201csmall and simple,\u201d but it ended up being a \u201cvery big party,\u201d as Wahid puts it.Christina\u2019s parents and sister flew over from the UK, and Christina\u2019s mother and sister took her shopping for a wedding dress in Cairo.Wahid\u2019s family gathered for the occasion, and the crew of the Kimo all turned up. Christina\u2019s fellow tour guides coordinated their respective tours to end in Cairo so they could attend too \u2013 although this meant a bunch of the tourists coming along as well.\u201cThere were probably about 50 people we\u2019d never met at our wedding reception,\u201d says Christina, laughing.\u201cAll dancing, all partying,\u201d recalls Wahid.The couple didn\u2019t mind, it only added to the celebratory atmosphere.\u201cIt was a really good party,\u201d says Christina.\u201cIt\u2019s not customary for most Egyptians to have alcohol at weddings,\u201d says Wahid. \u201cHowever my friends had two bottles of whiskey in one of their cars so we kept popping out to have discreet shots and run back into the reception.\u201dAfter the wedding, Christina took Wahid\u2019s last name, becoming Christina Kandil, and the couple traveled to the port city of Alexandria for their honeymoon.The River Nile's greatest attractions from Aswan to LuxorChristina and Wahid set their sights on relocating to Canada together, but the paperwork took longer than they anticipated. In the meantime, the couple settled in Christina\u2019s hometown of Portsmouth, on the south coast of England.Not long after they arrived, they threw a big party for Christina\u2019s friends who hadn\u2019t made it to Egypt for the wedding. They were thrilled to meet Wahid \u2013 they\u2019d heard a lot about him in Christina\u2019s gushing letters over the previous six months.But Wahid struggled with life in England. He spoke good English, but wasn\u2019t fluent and felt self-conscious about his accent when communicating with strangers.He also worried about his mother, who was still undergoing treatment for cancer. He\u2019d call home regularly to ask his father and brother for updates.Around nine months after moving to England, Wahid and Christina returned to Egypt to visit Wahid\u2019s family and friends. When Wahid\u2019s father picked them up at the airport, he had some shocking, sobering news: Wahid\u2019s mother had passed away a few months previously.Wahid couldn\u2019t believe it. Christina recalls that \u201chis legs literally went out from under him.\u201d\u201cThey were worried that, if he came, they thought it was going to ruin his residency for the UK or something, and they didn\u2019t realize it wouldn\u2019t be a problem. So they didn\u2019t tell him,\u201d she says.Wahid thinks the decision was less practical and more emotional \u2013 an act of protection more than anything else.\u201cWhen you are far from your family, they don\u2019t want you to get upset. They want to be there to protect you when you\u2019re upset,\u201d he says.Whatever the reason, the reality was Wahid moved to the UK and never saw his mother again.\u201cI was so looking forward to seeing her,\u201d he says.They met while hiking and fell in love. Two months later she was diagnosed with cancerIn July 1999, Wahid and Christina\u2019s Canadian visas were finally approved and the couple relocated to Calgary. They were excited, although when they arrived to an unseasonal summer snowstorm, they initially panicked that they\u2019d made the wrong decision.\u201cBut Canada ended up being really, really good for us,\u201d says Christina. \u201cIt was fantastic living there, we built a house there and had the kids.\u201dThe couple lived in Canada for nine years, first in Calgary and then Edmonton, welcoming two children, Yasmine and Tariq.Christina\u2019s mother would come and visit often. Despite her initial reservations, she was happy for Christina and Wahid.\u201cShe would never tell him \u2013 but she absolutely loved him,\u201d says Christina. \u201cShe\u2019s passed away now, sadly, but she absolutely thought he was a diamond.\u201dIn Canada, Christina worked for an accountancy company while Wahid rose up the ranks at an agricultural consulting company. They were pretty settled, but Wahid felt like he was never quite where he wanted to be professionally. He had periods of depression which Christina tried to help him through.\u201cI was always the one saying, \u2018We have a house, we have a car. We have two wonderful children. It\u2019s enough, it\u2019s okay,\u2019\u201d she recalls.Then, in the mid-noughties, Wahid was approached to start a company in Dubai. After some more twists and turns, he and Christina eventually invested all their savings into this company. And, following a rocky start, the business took off.She fell in love with a podcast host and flew across the world to meet herToday, Wahid and Christina still live in Dubai, which they say works well as a \u201cmiddle ground\u201d for their two cultures.\u201cYou\u2019ve got the Muslim side of things, so when you\u2019re doing Ramadan, you\u2019re surrounded by everyone who\u2019s doing it. But we\u2019re also so Westernized here as well,\u201d says Christina.Wahid is from a Muslim family and Christina was brought up Christian. Before their children were born, the couple decided they would bring them up in the Muslim faith, but still celebrate the Christian holidays of Easter and Christmas. They were conscious that as a multifaith, international couple, it was important to be on the same page about their kids\u2019 religion from the outset.But something Christina and Wahid didn\u2019t anticipate was what it would be like for their kids to be what\u2019s called \u201cThird Culture Kids\u201d \u2013 children who grow up in one country, with parents from two different countries altogether. It was only when Yasmine and Tariq became teenagers that their parents realized this was a lived experience they\u2019d never really be able to relate to.\u201cIt\u2019s not easy when you don\u2019t have roots,\u201d says Wahid. \u201cI grew up in Egypt, she grew up in England, and we still have some roots, even if you leave them. But for Third Culture Kids, they don\u2019t know who they are and I think they struggled with that a little bit when they were young.\u201dIn more recent years, Yasmine, who is now 22, and Tariq, who is 19, have been forming and embracing their own cultural identities, learning more about their families and their dual heritage.Yasmine, who is passionate about cinema, recently put together a short film about Wahid\u2019s mother, the grandmother she never knew. In the film, she imagined what it would be like to go back in time to meet her. For Christina and Wahid, watching this play out on screen was incredibly moving.\u201cWe\u2019re sitting in the cinema, we\u2019re watching it, crying our eyes out,\u201d says Christina. \u201cIt\u2019s such a nice legacy to have on that story.\u201dYasmine\u2019s film ambitions also include one day making a movie about her parents\u2019 love story. Wahid and Christina might be biased, but they reckon it could make a pretty good film.If one of us is down the other one pulls the other one through \u2013 it\u2019s a partnershipChristina KandilAfter all, as Wahid says, it \u201cwas a roller coaster, there were a lot of twists and turns \u2013 but I love it, I think it\u2019s meant to be that way.\u201d\u201cI love it too,\u201d says Christina. \u201cWe\u2019ve been through a lot, but he\u2019s my rock. I\u2019d like to think I\u2019m his rock too.\u201d\u201cYou are,\u201d says Wahid.\u201cIf one of us is down the other one pulls the other one through \u2013 it\u2019s a partnership,\u201d says Christina.It\u2019s now over 25 years since Christina and Wahid fell in love as twentysomethings on the River Nile. The couple are both in their 50s, but Wahid insists they\u2019re \u201cstill a bit young at heart.\u201d\u201cWe still have a lot of fun, and go dancing and drinking. I feel like we\u2019re still the same age almost \u2013 which is a bit silly, but I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve changed a lot.\u201d\u201cWe like each other\u2019s company,\u201d says Christina. She says they love to \u201csit in the garden, have a few drinks, play cards together \u2013 we don\u2019t need lots of people.\u201dToday, the couple see their unlikely meeting as the basis for the mantra they\u2019ve carried through their shared life: \u201cEverything happens for a reason.\u201d\u201cWe are such strong believers in that, because of how it all started for us,\u201d says Christina. \u201cLooking back on it now, we were both on that path to each other before we even knew it.\u201d\u201cThere were so many reasons for this not to happen,\u201d says Wahid. \u201cBut against all odds, it did.\u201d"

        "text": "Editor\u2019s Note:Sign up for, CNN Travel\u2019s weekly newsletter. Get the latest news in aviation, food and drink, where to stay and other travel developments.When Sharon Lane heard about a cruise companyaround the world, she immediately started fantasizing about life on board.Life at Sea Cruises is selling places on board the MV Gemini, which sets sail from Istanbul on November 1 on an epic global journey that will take in most of the planet\u2019s prime cruising destinations.Lane, a 75-year-old retired high school teacher from California, is a travel enthusiast. Back in the day, she taught foreign languages and loved taking her students on trips to Europe. In the 1990s, she decamped to Cape Town, South Africa for two years of adventures.More recently, Lane\u2019s become a cruise convert \u2013 not just because of the opportunities it affords her to see the world, but because the feeling of being adrift at sea is one of her favorite sensations.\u201cI actually prefer the ocean days, when we\u2019re just sailing through or powering through the oceans, it just thrills me,\u201d Lane tellsWhile it\u2019s long been Lane\u2019s dream to live on a cruise ship full time, the steep cost has always been a barrier. But when Lane heard about the three-year-voyage from a friend on a Friday night Zoom call, she hung up and spent the rest of the evening researching and budgeting.The cheapest rooms on the MV Gemini cost around $30,000 per year, including a discount for solo travelers. Lane calculated this cost was manageable, and decided to dive in.\u201cBy midnight that night, I had done enough research that I booked a room,\u201d she says.Now, Lane is busy preparing for MV Gemini\u2019s November disembarkation. She\u2019s selling most of her possessions, giving up her rental lease and preparing for a long stint at sea.\u201cThe logistics are crazy,\u201d says Lane. \u201cIt\u2019s a leap of faith, but I know there will be a place here when I get back. Or maybe I\u2019ll end up living in another country. I don\u2019t know, the sky\u2019s the limit.\u201dLane has opted for one of the cheapest cabins on board \u2013 what Life at Sea Cruises\u2019 is calling a \u201cVirtual Inside\u201d room. The 130-square-feet cabin has no window, but guests have been promised a screen that will broadcast live footage from outside the ship.\u201cIt shows literally what you would see outside your window if you had one,\u201d says Lane. \u201cAnd that\u2019s enough for me, it really is.\u201dLane insists the prospect of three years living in a room with no natural light isn\u2019t daunting. She plans to treat the cabin like a bedroom \u2013 she\u2019ll sleep there, but she won\u2019t spend a lot of time there otherwise. During the day, she\u2019ll relax elsewhere on the ship, walking around soaking up the ocean views, or she\u2019ll be busy enjoying exciting excursions.While she plans to sell \u201c95% of her possessions\u201d before setting sail, Lane says she\u2019ll bring along a few family photographs to make the cabin her own. She has a favorite picture of her now-adult grandsons back when they were kids and she took them on a whale-watching trip.I actually prefer the ocean days, when we\u2019re just sailing through or powering through the oceans, it just thrills me.Sharon Lane\u201cI have that laminated and I\u2019ll take magnets and I\u2019ll stick it to my door for two reasons,\u201d says Lane. \u201cOne, I get to see their faces every time I go in, which is always fun, and the other reason is it makes it really easy to know which door is yours, because you\u2019ve got your grandsons smiling back.\u201dLane hasn\u2019t yet told her daughter or grandsons she\u2019ll be embarking on the cruise. \u201cI don\u2019t want them to try and talk me out of it,\u201d she says. Lane thinks they will support her decision, but three years is a long time, and it\u2019s likely she won\u2019t see much of her loved ones on land while she\u2019s circumnavigating the world.But Lane\u2019s looking forward to video-calling family and friends from far flung locales \u2013 and she\u2019s excited to forge new connections on board. She\u2019s heard there will be many solo travelers on the voyage and reckons they will be keen to socialize. In fact, the cruise line has already connected many of the guests via an app, says Lane, and \u201cit\u2019s already a good time.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ve already gotten to know each other \u2013 already volunteering to help each other on things and giving each other ideas and answering questions and making plans. It\u2019s already fun.\u201dMeet the people who want to spend the rest of their lives on cruise shipsLane\u2019s been happily single for a long time, and dismisses the notion she might find romance on board.\u201cThat will not happen. It is completely out of my head. I have no interest. I want to make friends,\u201d she says.Plus, when she was making the decision to book onto the three year cruise, she found herself extra thankful for her independence \u2013 she\u2019s spoken with people who\u2019ve said they\u2019re keen to sign up, but their partner or spouse isn\u2019t interested, so it\u2019s not happening.\u201cI don\u2019t have that,\u201d she says. \u201cI can stay home if I want to. I can go someplace if I want to. The only thing that keeps me from doing things is health. As long as I control that I\u2019m okay.\u201dLane suffers from a medical condition in her lungs which she says makes her more susceptible to the effects of Covid-19 and other respiratory viruses. She\u2019s rarely been out of her home, let alone on vacation, since the pandemic took hold.But rather than being apprehensive about boarding a cruise ship, Lane suggests she\u2019ll be more comfortable on board than on land \u2013 she\u2019s confident in the cruise\u2019s Covid measures and the medical facilities available on board, and also plans to take her own precautions.\u201cWhen I\u2019m on the ship, when I\u2019m any place where there are other people, I\u2019ll wear an N95 mask, a surgical mask and goggles,\u201d she says.Lane won\u2019t disembark the ship in certain destinations, like Antarctica, where the cold air might aggravate her lungs. But she\u2019s very excited for much of the ship\u2019s itinerary, including stop offs in Scotland and Ireland, places she believes her ancestors hailed from, but which she\u2019s never visited before.You can now live on a cruise ship for $30,000 per yearIn total, the MV Gemini will stop at 375 ports over its three-year voyage, with 208 of these including overnight stays. The ship will stop everywhere from India to China to the Maldives to Australia, with some multi-night stopovers.Lane\u2019s excited to see the globe and glad travelers will have time to soak up each destination, but she thinks she\u2019ll spend more time on board the ship than many of her fellow passengers.\u201cFor me, the ocean\u2019s the thing,\u201d she says. \u201cThe ship itself in the ocean, that\u2019s the draw.\u201dLane plans to blog her experience \u2013 \u201cmy goal is to write something every day,\u201d she says. She hopes that, which she writes under a pen name, will allow her to savor the journey and share her adventures with loved ones back home and strangers alike.Lane hopes her dispatches might inspire others to take a risk and push themselves out of their comfort zone. She still regrets the years she spent in midlife, putting off traveling.\u201cI think I was always waiting for the perfect time to go when everything is right in life, when money is right, when appointments are right, when other people want to go,\u201d she says.\u201cDon\u2019t stay home,\u201d she encourages. \u201cHome may be where the heart is, home may be where you hang your hat \u2013 hang your hat, and then get on the boat, get on the plane, get in the car, go somewhere.\u201d"

        "text": "You\u2019re out for a hike on a glorious fall day. Suddenly, you spot a bear. And the bear has spotted you, too. Would you know what to do next?Beth Pratt sure would.She was once on the Old Gardiner Road Trail in Yellowstone National Park, enjoying her run in wild nature. Her reverie came to an end when she came upon a grizzly bear eating flowers.\u201cI stopped. It stood on its hind legs and looked at me. I knew that wasn\u2019t a threatening gesture,\u201d she toldlast year. \u201cI\u2019m not kidding, it waved its paw at me as if to say, \u2018just go on your way,\u2019 and went back to eating.\u201d\u201cAnd I walked slowly away and put some distance between us, and the encounter ended fine.\u201dWhen it comes to dealing with bears, Pratt does have a thing or two on almost all the rest of us, though.She is the California regional executive director for the National Wildlife Federation, a job she\u2019s had for more than 10 years. She also worked in Yellowstone for several years \u2013 and once saw nine grizzlies in one day there.She\u2019s also the author ofwhich addresses how people can co-exist with wildlife in California. And there\u2019s a chapter just on bears.Finally, she lives on the border of Yosemite National Park, and bears will pass through her yard, including this one seen in the footage above in late September 2021.You can hear the enthusiasm in Pratt\u2019s voice as she shares her bear bona fides and advice to make sure bear/human encounters are delightful, not dangerous.\u201cA wild bear is a beautiful sight to see. It\u2019s incredible to see them in the wild. I never had a bad experience with bears. What I try to get people to feel is respect, not fear, for bears. The animal usually wants to avoid the encounters.\u201dBear attacks are rare, Pratt and US National Park Service websites point out, but they do happen.Two collegiate wrestlers werenear Cody, Wyoming, in October; they had serious injuries but survived. Thenoted \u201can abundance of bear activity at low elevations\u201d in the area.A hiker died in ain Montana in late March.A 70-year-old hunterin France in November 2021., a couple\u2019s unleashed dog attracted unwanted attention from a black bear in early fall 2021 as they were picnicking on the Blue Ridge Parkway; they and their pet survivedAll illustrate the point that rare doesn\u2019t equal never.This is a good time of year to bone up on the bear facts and safety because many bears are now in a phase known as, Pratt said. \u201cIt\u2019s a period in the fall where bears are eating anything and everything to fatten up for hibernation.\u201dShe noted mountain lions are comparatively picky eaters. Not bears.\u201cThey eat everything: Ants. Roadkill. Flowers. Nuts. And unfortunately, human food that\u2019s not secured. Our food is very attractive to them; it\u2019s easy calories.\u201dHow to survive a rattlesnake biteCombine that with the fact that some national and state parks have become very popular and crowded, and you have a recipe for potential trouble.\u201cIf more people are using public lands and more people are in the mix, there\u2019s more potential for encounters and conflict. It does concern me a little bit,\u201d Pratt said.The key is being prepared \u2013 and that\u2019s where Pratt and others in the know come in.The best strategy is to never get in harm\u2019s way by enticing or provoking a wild bear. Trying to give a bear food or approaching cute cubs are particularly terrible ways to start an encounter. That\u2019s just looking for trouble.Thesite points out each bear and each encounter is different, but there are general guidelines useful in most situations.First of all,if you happen upon a bear. Don\u2019t approach it, and give it plenty of room to walk away from you. Yellowstone tells you to stay at least 100 yards (300 feet or 91 meters) away; Shenandoah National Park in Virginia suggests 200 feet (61 meters) for its black bears.You can run afoul of the law as well as the bears if you get too close and.Other tips:\u2022 Talk calmly to yourself in low tones to identify yourself as human.\u2022 Walk with a group (we\u2019re smellier and noisier in packs) and stay on designated trails.\u2022 If you have a small child or dog, pick it up.\u2022 Don\u2019t put yourself between cubs and their mother.\u2022and move away slowly, sideways if possible.Pratt said don\u2019t be alarmed if a bear stands on its hind legs; it\u2019s not considered an aggressive move.Almost all encounters are peaceful, Pratt said. Many times, people never knew they were even close to a bear, as in thistwo people emerging from a basement oblivious to a nearby bear.If a bear starts making assertive moves in your direction, you have important decisions to make \u2013 and fast.First thing is: Stand your ground with bears.With either grizzlies () or black bears, \u201cplease don\u2019t run. Bears can outrun anybody,\u201d Pratt said. \u201cDon\u2019t climb a tree either. They can also climb trees better than you.\u201dNew Jersey Department of Environmental Protection Division of Fish and Wildlife (where the black bear population is growing):\u2022 Make loud noises by yelling, banging pots and pans or using an airhorn to scare bears away.\u2022 Make yourself look as large as possible by waving your arms.\u2022 If you\u2019re with other people, stay together.Pratt said you can usually intimidate or bluff your way out of sticky bear situations, depending on the bear species and the situation.You\u2019re now in the rarest of situations \u2013 you\u2019ve attracted a bear\u2019s attention. It didn\u2019t move off. It\u2019s started coming at you aggressively and fast. You think you\u2019re about to be attacked. What\u2019s next?One very crucial thing is to make a quick ID of the kind of bear, because your strategy is going to be different.If it\u2019s a black bear, the NPS and Pratt have a clear message: Do not run. Do not play dead.\u201cYou want to stand your ground with black bears. Look as intimidating as possible,\u201d Pratt said. \u201cThrow things not at it but near it. Make that black bear intimidated by you. Let it know you are a big person. Pick something up; yell at it. If it attacks, fight back \u2013 aim for the face.\u201dIf you\u2019re dealing with a grizzly that won\u2019t back off and an attack is imminent, you\u2019re advised to do the opposite. You should play dead.\u201cAct as unthreatening as possible with a grizzly. Play dead with a grizzly if it starts to attack,\u201d Pratt said. \u201cTuck and cover. Get into a fetal position. Wrap your hands around your neck. Lay on your stomach. Once you do that, 99 percent of the time the grizzly will move on.\u201dIncredible images from Wildlife Photographer of the Year 2022 contestNPS elaborates: \u201cRemain still until the bear leaves the area. Fighting back usually increases the intensity of such attacks. However, if the attack persists, fight back vigorously.\u201dFighting back a grizzly bear is the last resort \u2013 \u201cyour Hail Mary pass\u201d as Pratt called it \u2013 when all other options are out.An exception to this rule: If you\u2019re camping in a tent and are attacked, that bear likely sees you as food. NPS and Pratt say this is a time to fight.First off, know your area and read up on the bears there.In North America, grizzlies have a much more limited range than black bears do. In the Lower 48, they are in Washington, Montana, Idaho and Wyoming. And, too. They also cover.Black bears have more territory. They can be found in as many as, much of Canada and even parts of northern Mexico, thesays.So say you\u2019re in Quebec, the Appalachians, the Ozarks, California or even parts of Florida, that\u2019s going to be a black bear. But if you\u2019re in Yellowstone or Glacier National Park, for instance, that could be a black bear or a grizzly. That\u2019s when it\u2019s crucial to know how to make a quick visual ID.You can\u2019t go by the color of the fur. Black bears can be black, brown, cinnamon, blond, blue-gray or white,.One of the best ways to tell the difference, Pratt said, is to look for a hump at the shoulders. Grizzlies have them. Black bears don\u2019t.She also said the face shapes are different. \u201cBlack bear faces look a little more cuddly to me, a little rounder, with a straight nose. A grizzly bear face looks more like a wild predator and has a dished shape.\u201dThis NPS webpage hasto tell the differences.Fun facts:\u2013 from tropical Sri Lanka to the frigid reaches of Russia, Norway and Canada. And European websites such asgive many of the same safety tips as North Americans get.Some people like to carry bear spray and/or a weapon with them when venturing into bear country.Pratt is an advocate of the former and says be sure to practice using it first before going into the wild.on using spray to ward off bears.She\u2019s more cautious about bringing firearms with you, especially if you\u2019re inexperienced. \u201cTaking a grizzly out with one shot would be tough. You need to be very experienced with a gun to increase your chance of safety.\u201dHow to survive an alligator attackAin 2008 found spray more effective than a firearm. And spray doesn\u2019t permanently harm a bear.Some people like to carry bear bells on their hikes, hoping the noise will ward off the animals. Butthat \u201cYelling, clapping and talking are more effective ways of alerting a bear to your presence.\u201dIf you\u2019re out camping overnight, you have extra considerations to take.Kyle Patterson, management specialist and public affairs officer at Rocky Mountain National Park, emailed CNN Travel some ways to keep hungry bears away.Patterson advised using a food storage locker if provided in campgrounds and picnic areas. Also, \u201cavoid storing food and coolers in your vehicle. If you must, store food in airtight containers in the trunk or out of sight. Close vehicle windows completely.\u201dNational Park adventures: Best parks to get your thrillsOther tips and cautions:\u2022 Don\u2019t store food in tents or pop-up campers in campgrounds or in vehicles at trailheads.\u2022 Don\u2019t leave food, coolers and dirty cookware unattended. Park rangers may confiscate them and cite you.\u2022 Get rid of garbage in bear-resistant dumpsters and trash cans.Human-fed bears usually end up as chronic problems and need to be removed, Patterson said. \u201cA fed bear is a dead bear.\u201dPratt emphasized it\u2019s up to humans to be responsible to these creatures.\u201cThe bears are just being bears. We are wayore of a threat to them. Bear attacks are so rare. And fatalities are even rarer,\u201d she said.\u201cThe bears\u2019 lives are more at threat than ours in encounters. I want people to have magical, wonderful experiences in the wild. I want people to feel OK about having these encounters.\u201dTop image: A grizzly and her cub walk through a meadow in Yellowstone National Park.

CNN retains full editorial control over subject matter, reporting and frequency of the articles and videos within the sponsorship, in compliance with our.Mount Kilimanjaro may be the ultimate quest. But the undisputed champ of African hiking is that big country at the bottom end of the continent \u2013 South Africa.One of the country\u2019s greatest strengths is sheer volume. The global hiking applists more than 3,700 trekking trails and routes in South Africa compared to other top African trekking destinations: Kenya (20 trails), Tanzania (21), Namibia (33) and Morocco (18).South Africa also offers incredible variety when it comes to terrain and climate: trails that range from coastal, mountain and desert to the country\u2019s unique fynbos landscapes, which offer Mediterranean-like vegetation with extremely high biodiversity.Trails in South Africa tend to be well-maintained and well-marked. Many of them boast overnight hiker huts. While it\u2019s certainly possible to hire a guide, most of them are DIY \u2013 easy to hike on your own with equipment that can be rented or purchased at outdoor outfitters in Cape Town, Johannesburg and other big cities.Last but not least is the fauna factor. While animals exist on every South Africa trail, those that pose the biggest threat to humans on foot (lion, elephant, rhino, buffalo, leopard) are largely confined to places where you should never hike without a guide \u2014 namely game reserves and wildlife-oriented national parks.Here are nine of South Africa\u2019s best multiday backpacking trails:South Africa\u2019s oldest (established in 1968) and most celebrated hiking route, the Otter Trail runs along the Eastern Cape coast between Storms River Mouth and Nature\u2019s Valley in Garden Route National Park.The terrain varies from sandy strands and rocky shoreline to dense maritime forest and flower-filled fynbos vegetation with its iconic proteas. Birdlife is profuse and there\u2019s a chance of spotting sea lions, dolphins, blue duiker antelope, hyrax and the cape clawless otters that give the trail its name.Four overnight camps with huts, toilets, showers and braai (barbecue) areas are spaced along the trail. To preserve the integrity (and serenity) of the trail, only 12 hiking permits are available each day.About 45 kilometers (27 miles)5 daysOtter Trail in South Africa has a waiting list to hike its rugged pathsSummit the legendary Drakensberg escarpment on a vertiginous route that rises high above Thendele Royal Natal National Park in KwaZulu-Natal province.The hike isn\u2019t long in terms of miles, but at times it\u2019s literally straight up via chain ladders. The relatively flat summit \u2013 which lies at around 3,200 meters (10,700 feet) \u2013 is shared by South Africa and Lesotho.Hikers who spend at least two nights at the summit have time to hike along the escarpment to jaw-dropping views of the Amphitheatre and Tugela Falls, which plunges a world-record 983 meters (3,225 feet).Even on warm, sunny days at the bottom, hikes should be prepared for rain and thick mist at the summit, and even snow during the southern hemisphere winter. No more than 50 hikers per day are allowed to camp overnight.45 kilometers (27 miles)2-3 daysHiking South Africa's Wild Coast through the spectacular Mkambati Nature ReserveAugrabies Falls National Park in the Northern Cape provides a dramatic desert setting for an under-the-radar route that starts near the biggest waterfall along the Orange River and meanders along the crest of its deep gorge.Only opening between April and October when temperatures are at their mildest, the trail is hot and dry throughout the year. Hikers should carry plenty of water, sunscreen and head protection.Hikers sleep in huts with bunk beds, toilets, cooking areas and potable water. The trail is limited to 12 hikers per day. Reptiles and birds are the most commonly spotted wildlife, but the national park also safeguards giraffes, zebras, leopards and a variety of antelopes including its namesake klipspringer.39.5 kilometers (25 miles)3 days:The fabled Cape of Good Hope provides a historical and highly scenic setting for a rugged loop trail with awesome ocean views and rich fynbos vegetation.Starting from the Cape of Good Hope National Park entrance gate, the trail hops across mountains overlooking False Bay to Cape Point and features three overnight huts with bunk beds, showers, toilets, solar power and cooking areas. Day two takes the hike up the Atlantic shore and across the Cape Peninsula with a grand finale atop Rooihoogte peak.The area\u2019s biodiversity is unparalleled among temperate regions, with more than 1,080 plant species and 250 bird varieties, as well as ostriches, zebras, caracal cats and eight kinds of antelopes.33.8 kilometers (21 miles)2 daysWalking with whales in South AfricaThe best overnight hike within a short drive of Johannesburg, the Summit Trail roves the rugged highlands of Kgaswane Mountain Reserve in the Magaliesberg Range.The trail is accessed from several points including the park entrance near Rustenburg and the park visitor center. Hikers can crash at a primitive campground near the summit or in one of several mountain huts.Humans and their evolutionary kinfolk have been hunting, gathering and hiking in the Magaliesberg for more than two million years, reflected in the fact that Kgaswane is part of a biosphere reserve that includes the Cradle of Mankind World Heritage Site.About 25 kilometers (16 miles)2 daysThe lush inland mountains of Garden Route National Park provide a primal setting for a route that features prehistoric fern trees and cool rock pools, river crossings where the water is often waist-high and bright green highlands reminiscent of Scotland.And it starts with the paradise beach at Nature\u2019s Valley, near the first of five overnight huts tucked into the pristine indigenous forest or on lofty ridges with cooling breezes and panoramic views.Hikers can top or tail the trek with other nearby adventure activities like bungee jumping, treetop canopy course, whitewater rafting or tubing and sea kayaking.62 kilometers (39 miles)6 daysBabanango: South Africa's big new game park is the result of a dramatic transformationA hiking experience rather than a fixed trail, the Rim of Africa is a guided trek stretching through the mountains and valleys of the Western Cape from the remote Cederberg range north of Cape Town to the Outeniqua range near George.Led by veteran hikers, the route is divided into nine traverses which hikers tackle one at a time over a period of years rather than an epic nonstop through-hike. Each traverse takes seven to 10 days during the South African spring (September-November).Much of the route runs through classic fynbos vegetation and nearly all of the trek is considered strenuous, with many steep grades. Primitive wilderness camping is the norm, with buckets or natural pools to \u201cshower.\u201d But there\u2019s nothing else like it anywhere on the continent.760 kilometers (472 miles)9 weeksThe Free State\u2019s most renowned hike, the Ribbok climbs through the colorful sandstone cliffs and rock formations of Golden Gate Highlands National Park, around a three-hour drive east of Bloemfontein.Kicking off from Glen Reenen Rest Camp in the heart of the park, the first day is a relatively easy climb to an overnight mountain hut with bunks, a bathroom, braai (barbecue) area, and the possibility of a refreshing dip at the bottom of Ribbokspruit waterfall.Day two entails a 1,000-meter (3,280-foot) climb to the summit of Generaalskop peak (2,757 meters/9,045 feet) before a descent back to Glen Reenen. Along the way look for wildebeest, zebra, blesbok, springbok and other grazers that inhabit the park.28 kilometers (18 miles)2 daysLocated roughly 500 kilometers (300 miles) north of Cape Town, Namaqua National Park protects a pristine stretch of Atlantic coastline famed for its wild beaches and incredible spring wildflower super bloom.The park\u2019s longest footpath is the six-kilometer (3.1-mile) Heaviside Trail, named for the Heaviside dolphins you can spot offshore. Running over coastal dunes and along remote beaches, the route runs between Kwass and Koringkorrel Baai campsites.By following both the footpath and sandy 4x4 trails, intrepid hikers can extend their Namaqualand trek into a multiday hike that covers the entire coast of the national park between Groenriviermond Lighthouse and the Spoeg River with its spooky caves, with nine campgrounds along the way.About 51 kilometers (31 miles)4-7 days"
