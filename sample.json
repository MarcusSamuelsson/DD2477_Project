The cargo had left the Chinese city of Qingdao and passed through Busan in South Korea before reaching Mexico.Fentanyl is up to 50 times more powerful than heroin. The  67% of the 107,375 US deaths from drug overdoses or poisonings in 2021 were linked to fentanyl or similar opioids. Fentanyl is linked to more deaths of Americans under 50 than any other cause, the DEA says.The US authorities blame Mexican drug gangs for supplying fentanyl to users across the US. Last month three sons of drugs kingpin \"El Chapo\" - members of Mexico's Sinaloa cartel -  with fentanyl trafficking, but only one of them is in custody. Their father Joaqu\u00edn \"El Chapo\" Guzm\u00e1n is serving a life sentence in the US.President L\u00f3pez Obrador has said fentanyl is not produced in Mexico but bought by the drugs gangs from suppliers in Asia.Last month Chinese foreign ministry  \"there is no such thing as illegal trafficking of fentanyl between China and Mexico\". \"China has not been notified by Mexico on the seizure of scheduled fentanyl precursors from China,\" she said. Drugs listed in schedules are subject to various official restrictions. Mao Ning said the widespread fentanyl abuse in the US was a problem \"completely 'made in USA'\".El Chapo sons among cartel members charged by USUS seizes enough fentanyl to kill every AmericanHelp stop American drug deaths, US asks ChinaDrug lord 'El Chapo' sentenced to life in prison"

Vancouver police said it arrested a man for \"drug trafficking in connection with an illicit drug dispensary\" but have not laid formal charges.The arrest on Thursday came one day after Mr Martin opened his shop. He began selling the drugs on Wednesday out of a mobile trailer parked in Vancouver's Downtown Eastside, a neighbourhood with a high rate of drug use and concentrated drug overdose prevention services.Mr Martin, whose brother died from an overdose,  of small quantities of hard drugs in the province of British Columbia (BC) early this year as part of a three-year pilot project. The public health measure was put forward in response to a growing number of overdose deaths from fentanyl-laced drugs in western Canada. In 2022, more than 2,720 people died from an overdose in BC - an average of seven people a day. BC has the second-highest rate of overdose deaths in Canada.Mr Martin told local news outlets that he planned to sell batches of cocaine, methamphetamine, heroin and crack in small quantities, up to 2.5 grams, in an attempt to prevent further deaths. He said the drugs had been tested to ensure they did not contain fentanyl. This video can not be playedVancouver's unusual approach offers opioid users injection sites, antidotes and even heroin on prescription.In a statement, Constable Tania Visintin said Vancouver police \"support measures aimed at improving public safety for people who use drugs, including harm reduction services and decriminalisation\" but said police would continue enforcement on drug trafficking. The CBC reported that dozens had lined up at the entrance of Mr Martin's mobile store to buy drugs on Wednesday afternoon. Mr Martin was unnamed in the police press release announcing the arrest but it was widely reported in Canadian media. He is out of police custody pending a court hearing, police said. He has also been asked to stay away from Vancouver's Downtown Eastside. BC has often been at the forefront of enacting harm reduction measures to prevent drug overdoses. The Downtown Eastside is home to the first legal supervised drug consumption site in North America, where people could bring their own substances to use in the presence of trained staff who can quickly respond in the event of an overdose. Since Insite opened in 2003, dozens of similar legal sites have opened across the US and Canada.The overall number of fentanyl-related drug overdose deaths in Canada has sharply risen since 2016, increasing by more than 150% compared to 2022.

        "text": "A convicted man in Oklahoma has escaped a fourth execution attempt after a rare intervention from the US Supreme Court.The court halted Richard Glossip's 18 May execution after the state's top lawman said he did not receive a fair trial. In 2015, Glossip was only a few steps away from the execution chamber when guards halted the execution to review the lethal injection drugs. The order puts the sentence on hold for now while the court considers the case. Oklahoma Attorney General Gentner Drummond has re-investigated the conviction and asked for a new trial on the grounds that prosecutors concealed information about his accuser that could have helped him fight the charge. Glossip's boss Barry Van Treese, the owner of the Oklahoma City motel, was beaten to death in 1997.His colleague Justin Sneed was convicted of the killing but said Glossip had ordered him to carry out the murder.Glossip, 60, and his family have maintained his innocence during his 26 years in prison, saying that Sneed acted alone.He was first convicted in 1998 but that was overturned in 2001, only for Glossip to be convicted again three years later.During his time behind bars, he has eaten three last meals, and seen his execution scheduled for nine different dates.Attorney General Drummond, a Republican, found in a report released last year that prosecutors at his 2004 re-trial did not disclose that Glossip's accuser had been treated for a serious psychiatric condition.\"Absent this court's intervention, an execution will move forward under circumstances where the Attorney General has already confessed error \u2014 a result that would be unthinkable,\" Mr Drummond wrote in his request to the court.The stay will remain in place until the court decides whether to order a new trial and possibly toss out his conviction. The case has received international attention, with Pope Francis, Kim Kardashian and Richard Branson voicing support for Glossip.\"There's so many exonerations in this country - so many people were railroaded, so many people's lives were taken from them,\" Glossip  on Thursday. \"Why is it so hard for people to think that somebody's actually innocent?\"Glossip, who married an anti-death penalty activist last year, says he has remained focused on the things he wants to do if he gets out of prison. \"I've never been on a plane \u2026 So they want to get me on a plane and take me somewhere,\" he said. \"And I've never seen the ocean, so we want to go do that.\"Tennessee fires officials after execution errorsHow many countries still have the death penalty?A third of US executions botched in 2022 - reportOklahoma halts executions over drugsUS execution halted 'to check drugs'Retrial for world's longest-serving death row inmate"

That's my wife\" before his lawyer corrects him. Mr Trump then replies that the photo is \"very blurry\".At another point in the video, Mr Trump is unable to recall the date of his marriage to Ms Maples, his second wife and mother to his daughter Tiffany.Ms Carroll, a writer and long-time advice columnist, is suing the former president for battery over the original incident, as well as for defamation over his adamant denials of the incident.In the deposition, Mr Trump repeated a comment he has made since Ms Carroll first came forward in 2019, saying: \"I say it with as much respect as I can, but she is not my type.\"\"Physically, she's not my type, and now that I've gotten indirectly to hear things about her, she wouldn't be my type in any way, shape, or form,\" he adds.He goes on to tell Ms Carroll's attorney Roberta Kaplan: \"You would not be my choice either, I hope you're not insulted.\"This video can not be playedWatch: Trump denies rape accusation by E Jean CarrollDuring their combative exchanges, he calls Ms Kaplan a \"political operative\" and a \"disgrace\".Lawyers for Mr Trump have said he will not testify in person, but the former president told reporters he might cut short a trip to Ireland and the UK to \"confront\" Ms Carroll in court.In light of the comments, the judge granted Mr Trump until Sunday afternoon to decide if he will take the stand.The key moments from Trump's civil rape trialTrump mistook rape accuser for ex-wife, trial toldFriend says Carroll called her after Trump attackTrump rape accuser says her generation stayed quietTrial begins in columnist's rape suit against Trump"

        "text": "The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared that Covid-19 no longer represents a \"global health emergency\". The statement represents a major step towards ending the pandemic and comes three years after it first declared its highest level of alert over the virus. Officials said the virus' death rate had dropped from a peak of more than 100,000 people per week in January 2021 to just over 3,500 on 24 April. The head of the WHO said at least seven million people died in the pandemic. But Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said that the true figure was \"likely\" closer to 20 million deaths - nearly three times the official estimate - and he warned that the virus remained a significant threat. \"Yesterday, the Emergency Committee met for the 15th time and recommended to me that I declare an end to the public health emergency of international concern. I've accepted that advice. It is therefore with great hope that I declare Covid-19 over as a global health emergency,\" Dr Tedros said. He added that the decision had been considered carefully for some time and made on the basis of careful analysis of data.But he warned the removal of the highest level of alert did not mean the danger was over and said the emergency status could be reinstated if the situation changed. \"The worst thing any country can do now is to use this news as a reason to let down its guard, to dismantle the systems it has built, or to send the message to its people that Covid-19 is nothing to worry about,\" he said.The World Health Organization first declared Covid-19 to be a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) in January 2020. This signalled the need for coordinated global action to protect people from the new virus. It will now be up to individual countries to continue to manage Covid in the way they think best.Vaccines were one of the major turning points in the pandemic. According to the WHO, 13 billion doses have been given, allowing many people to be protected from serious illness and death. But in many countries vaccines have not reached most of those in need. More than 765 million confirmed Covid infections have been recorded worldwide.The US and UK, like many other countries, have already talked about \"living with the virus\" and wound down many of the tests and social mixing rules. Dr Mike Ryan, from the WHO's health emergencies programme, said the emergency may have ended, but the threat is still there. \"We fully expect that this virus will continue to transmit and this is the history of pandemics,\" he said.\"It took decades for the final throes of the pandemic virus of 1918 to disappear. \"In most cases, pandemics truly end when the next pandemic begins.\"US to end Covid vaccine air travel requirementsCovid whistleblower returns home to Wuhan after jail"

The protests were sparked by the death in custody of a Kurdish Iranian woman.Mahsa Amini, 22, died after allegedly being beaten by morality police who arrested her for what they said was her failure to wear her headscarf properly.The protests spread nationwide, but have been violently suppressed. Human rights groups say security forces have killed at least 530 protesters - including around 70 children - since the protests began.One of the documents seen by BBC Persian says Mr Karimi \"was invited [to Iran] by our agent nine times and has received serious warnings\".In a letter marked \"top secret\" and dated 24 October 2022, Iran's Revolutionary Guard's intelligence unit informed Tehran's prosecutor that \"Karimi's recent activities were instigated by his wife Sahar Davari and her family\".In the late 1980s Iran had executed Ms Davari's father, Gholamali Davari, on charges of being a member of the Communist Tudeh Party. He was an officer in Iran's air force at the time. The document claims Karimi's in-laws, on his behalf, were aiming to sell his mansion in Lavasan, an affluent suburb of capital Tehran, for $20m (18m euros; \u00a316m) in order to emigrate permanently. In the document the Revolutionary Guard asked for a travel ban on Karimi, Davari, her mother, step-father, brother and sister. This would prevent them from leaving the country, including Mr Karimi and his wife if either of them returned.The leaked letter was given to BBC Persian by a hacking group called Edalat-e Ali (Ali's Justice).Mr Karimi told BBC Persian in a phone interview that his older brother was also prosecuted several times and banned from leaving the country.\"My friend was interrogated three or four times in the notorious Evin prison,\" he said.He said Iran keeps people he follows on Instagram under close surveillance. \"One of them needed both a deposit bail and a guarantor to be able to leave Iran,\" he said.In early October, Iranian state media also claimed Mr Karimi had sold his mansion in Lavasan.But Mr Karimi told BBC Persian that this was not true.\"Security forces raided the place and brutally beat up the janitor,\" he said, adding that the property had been empty ever since.\"My neighbours tell me lights are on some nights and plain-clothes agents are seen going in and out,\" he said.Mr Karimi shared pictures of CCTV which Iranian authorities have installed near his property.\"Any car stops there for five minutes, security forces swarm the place,\" he said.Mr Karimi and his family have since moved from the UAE to an undisclosed location.Iranian anti-government football fans protest in QatarIranian protesters look to outside world for help"

Millions of people have used ChatGPT since it launched in November 2022. It can answer questions using natural, human like language and it can also mimic other writing styles. Microsoft has spent billions of dollars on it and it was added to Bing last month.  It has also said that it will embed a version of the technology in its Office apps, including Word, Excel, Powerpoint and Outlook.Bard, Google's; rival artificial-intelligence chatbot, is now available, but only to specific users over the age of 18.

        "text": "Amazon's core e-commerce business may be struggling - but the profit-making parts of its business are delivering. Online sales were flat in the first three months of the year compared with the same period in 2022, the company said on Thursday. But it offset that with better-than-expected sales in its cloud services and advertising units.Profits also jumped in a sign that the firm's cost-cutting drive may be starting to pay off. \"There's a lot to like about how our teams are delivering for customers, particularly amidst an uncertain economy,\" chief executive Andy Jassy said.Amazon sales have been sluggish as shoppers return to in-store spending after the pandemic and have tightened budgets in response to rising living costs. Concerns about the path for the economy have also weighed on its business, as firms grow more cautious about spending. Since taking the reins last year, Mr Jassy has been pushing the firm to improve its performance, winding down some programmes, such as its Halo fitness division just this week, halting real estate expansion plans, overhauling its delivery network in the US and announcing thousands of job cuts. The size of the firm's workforce has shrunk by 10% since March last year - shedding more than 75,000 employees just since the end of last year. Insider Intelligence principal analyst Andrew Lipsman said this may be starting to pay off. \"For the first time in several quarters, Amazon may finally have a bit of wind at its back,\" Mr Lipsman said. In Amazon's advertising unit, revenue jumped 23% compared with last year, while sales at Amazon Web Services - long the company's big profit driver - grew 16%.Overall sales were up 9% to $127.4bn in the January-March period - comparable to growth at the end of last year - and a big comedown from the pandemic, when sales surged more than 40% in some quarters.Still the firm's performance was better than many analysts had expected and profits jumped to $3.2bn, compared with a $3.8bn loss in the quarter last year. \"Amazon did what it needed to do in Q1 by reversing - or at least stalling - its most troublesome declining growth trends,\" Mr Lipsman said.Shares in the company initially gained more than 7% in after-hours trade - reversing those gains after executives warned analysts that firms remained cautious about cloud services spending.

It is the eighth most-visited site in the UK, according to data from analytics company SimilarWeb. The Online Safety Bill, currently before Parliament, places duties on tech firms to protect users from harmful or illegal content and is expected to come fully into force some time in 2024.Neil Brown, a solicitor specialising in internet and telecoms law, says that under the bill, services likely to be accessed by children must have \"proportionate systems and processes\" designed to prevent them from encountering harmful content. That could include age verification. Lucy Crompton-Reid, chief executive of Wikimedia UK, an independent charity affiliated with the foundation, warns some material on the site could trigger age verification.\"For example, educational text and images about sexuality could be misinterpreted as pornography,\" she said.But Ms MacKinnon wrote: \"The Wikimedia Foundation will not be verifying the age of UK readers or contributors.\"As well as requiring Wikipedia to gather data about its users, checking ages would also require a \"drastic overhaul\" to technical systems.If a service does not comply with the bill, there can be serious consequences potentially including large fines, criminal sanctions for senior staff, or restricting access to a service in the UK.Wikimedia UK fears that site could be blocked because of the Bill, and the risk that it will mandate age checks.It was \"definitely possible that one of the most visited websites in the world - and a vital source of freely accessible knowledge and information for millions of people - won't be accessible to UK readers (let alone UK-based contributors)\", wrote Ms Crompton-Reid.There are currently 6.6 million articles on Wikipedia, and she said it was \"impossible to imagine\"  how it would cope with checking content to comply with the bill. She added: \"Worldwide there are two edits per second across Wikipedia's 300-plus languages.\" The foundation has previously said the bill would fundamentally change the way the site operated by forcing it to moderate articles rather than volunteers. It wants the law to follow the EU Digital Services Act, which differentiates between centralised content moderation carried out by employees and the Wikipedia-style model by community volunteers.On Tuesday, the House of Lords debated an amendment from Conservative peer Lord Moylan that would exempt services \"provided for the public benefit\", such as encyclopaedias, from the bill. Heritage Minister Lord Parkinson said he did not think this would be feasible, but added that Wikipedia was an example of how community moderation can be effective. He said the bill did not say that every service needed to have age checks, and it was expected that \"only services which pose the highest risk to children will use age verification technologies\".Ms Crompton-Reid told the BBC that while Lord Parkinson's remarks \"reassured\" her , the charity did not want to be relying on future goodwill and interpretation of legislation.It would continue to urge that protections to community moderation were in the bill through measures such as an exception for public benefit websites like Wikipedia, she said.A government spokesperson told the BBC the bill had been \"designed to strike the balance between tackling harm without imposing unnecessary burdens on low-risk tech companies\". Communications watchdog Ofcom will enforce it and would \"focus on services where the risk of harm is highest\".The government also believes it is unlikely Wikipedia would be classed as a category one service, those that would be subject to the bill's strictest rules.

At the time Arm was listed in London and New York.The firm designs the tech behind processors - commonly known as chips - that power devices from smartphones to game consoles.Its designs are used by chip manufacturers like the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company and household brands like Apple and Samsung to build their own processors.Softbank said it had \"confidentially submitted a draft registration statement\" for the listing to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). did not reveal how much it planned to raise or when the share sale might take place.The firm was seeking to raise between $8bn and $10bn through the listing this year on the technology-heavy Nasdaq platform in New York, according to reports.Listing a firm on a stock exchange takes it from being a private to a public company, with investors able to buy and sell shares of a company's stock on specific exchanges.Sometimes referred to as the \"crown jewel\" of the UK's technology sector, Arm was founded in Cambridge, England, in 1990.Earlier this year, Arm said it did not plan to pursue a London Stock Exchange listing.Reports in January said that UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak had restarted talks with Softbank about a possible London listing.Arm's decision raised concerns that the UK market is not doing enough to attract tech company stock offerings, with US exchanges seen to offer higher profiles and valuations.The registration shows that Softbank is pushing ahead with the multi-billion dollar sale despite difficult conditions in the global financial markets.The number of stock market listings has fallen sharply since Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

        "text": "This video can not be playedWatch: AI 'godfather' Geoffrey Hinton tells the BBC of AI dangers as he quits GoogleA man widely seen as the godfather of artificial intelligence (AI) has quit his job, warning about the growing dangers from developments in the field. Geoffrey Hinton, 75, announced his resignation from Google in a statement to the New York Times, saying he now regretted his work. He told the BBC some of the dangers of AI chatbots were \"quite scary\".\"Right now, they're not more intelligent than us, as far as I can tell. But I think they soon may be.\"Dr Hinton also accepted that his age had played into his decision to leave the tech giant, telling the BBC: \"I'm 75, so it's time to retire.\"Dr Hinton's pioneering research on neural networks and deep learning has paved the way for current AI systems like ChatGPT. In artificial intelligence, neural networks are systems that are similar to the human brain in the way they learn and process information. They enable AIs to learn from experience, as a person would. This is called deep learning.The British-Canadian cognitive psychologist and computer scientist told the BBC that chatbots could soon overtake the level of information that a human brain holds.\"Right now, what we're seeing is things like GPT-4 eclipses a person in the amount of general knowledge it has and it eclipses them by a long way. In terms of reasoning, it's not as good, but it does already do simple reasoning,\" he said.\"And given the rate of progress, we expect things to get better quite fast. So we need to worry about that.\"In the New York Times article, Dr Hinton referred to \"bad actors\" who would try to use AI for \"bad things\".When asked by the BBC to elaborate on this, he replied: \"This is just a kind of worst-case scenario, kind of a nightmare scenario. \"You can imagine, for example, some bad actor like [Russian President Vladimir] Putin decided to give robots the ability to create their own sub-goals.\"The scientist warned that this eventually might \"create sub-goals like 'I need to get more power'\".He added: \"I've come to the conclusion that the kind of intelligence we're developing is very different from the intelligence we have. \"We're biological systems and these are digital systems. And the big difference is that with digital systems, you have many copies of the same set of weights, the same model of the world. \"And all these copies can learn separately but share their knowledge instantly. So it's as if you had 10,000 people and whenever one person learnt something, everybody automatically knew it. And that's how these chatbots can know so much more than any one person.\"Matt Clifford, the chairman of the UK's Advanced Research and Invention Agency, speaking in a personal capacity, told the BBC that Dr Hinton's announcement \"underlines the rate at which AI capabilities are accelerating\".\"There's an enormous upside from this technology, but it's essential that the world invests heavily and urgently in AI safety and control,\" he said.Dr Hinton joins a growing number of experts who have expressed concerns about AI - both the speed at which it is developing and the direction in which it is going.In March, , including the tech billionaire Elon Musk - called for a pause on all developments more advanced than the current version of AI chatbot ChatGPT so robust safety measures could be designed and implemented.Yoshua Bengio, another so-called godfather of AI, who along with Dr Hinton and Yann LeCun won the 2018 Turing Award for their work on deep learning, also signed the letter.  that \"we need to take a step back\".But Dr Hinton told the BBC that \"in the shorter term\" he thought AI would deliver many more benefits than risks, \"so I don't think we should stop developing this stuff,\" he added.He also said that international competition would mean that a pause would be difficult. \"Even if everybody in the US stopped developing it, China would just get a big lead,\" he said.Dr Hinton also said he was an expert on the science, not policy, and that it was the responsibility of government to ensure AI was developed \"with a lot of thought into how to stop it going rogue\".Dr Hinton stressed that he did not want to criticise Google and that the tech giant had been \"very responsible\".\"I actually want to say some good things about Google. And they're more credible if I don't work for Google.\"In a statement, Google's chief scientist Jeff Dean said: \"We remain committed to a responsible approach to AI. We're continually learning to understand emerging risks while also innovating boldly.\"This video can not be playedWatch: What is artificial intelligence?It is important to remember that AI chatbots are just one aspect of artificial intelligence, even if they are the most popular right now. AI is behind the algorithms that dictate what video-streaming platforms decide you should watch next. It can be used in recruitment to filter job applications, by insurers to calculate premiums, it can diagnose medical conditions (although human doctors still get the final say).  What we are seeing now though is the rise of AGI - artificial general intelligence - which can be trained to do a number of things within a remit. So for example, ChatGPT can only offer text answers to a query, but the possibilities within that, as we are seeing, are endless.But the pace of AI acceleration has surprised even its creators. It has evolved dramatically since Dr Hinton built a pioneering image analysis neural network in 2012. Even Google boss Sundar Pichai said in a recent interview that even he did not fully understand everything that its AI chatbot, Bard, did. Make no mistake, we are on a speeding train right now, and the concern is that one day it will start building its own tracks.

        "text": "The US will not delay a deadline for airlines to refit planes with new sensors to address possible 5G interference, despite concerns the cut-off date could cause travel disruption. Transport Secretary Pete Buttigieg said on Tuesday that airlines were told the 1 July deadline would remain in place.Airlines have warned that they will not be able to meet the deadline and may be forced to ground some planes. Telecoms firms have previously delayed 5G rollout to allow airlines to adapt. In the US, the radio frequencies being used for 5G are in part of the spectrum known as C-Band. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and aviation companies have previously raised concerns that C-Band spectrum 5G wireless could interfere with aircraft altimeters, which measure a plane's height above the ground. In a call with airline companies on Tuesday, Mr Buttigieg told them to work aggressively to retrofit their planes before the deadline, according to the Reuters news agency.Concerns about 5G interference led to some disruptions at US airports last year. Major tech companies, like Verizon and AT&T, agreed last year to delay the rollout of 5G technology until 1 July 2023 to allow airlines time to retrofit their altimeters. The decision came after several previous delays. The International Air Transport Association (IATA), a trade group representing more than 100 airlines that fly in and out of the US, has said the decision not to extend the deadline makes summer disruptions more likely. \"Supply chain issues make it unlikely that all aircraft can be upgraded by the 1 July deadline, threatening operational disruptions during the peak northern summer travel season,\" the organisation said on Tuesday, adding that the estimated cost to upgrade planes is $638m (\u00a3511m).\"Airlines did not create this situation. They are victims of poor government planning and coordination,\" said Nick Careen from the IATA.Airlines have previously said they want 5G signals to be excluded from \"the approximate two miles of airport runways at affected airports as defined by the FAA\".Phone companies have spent tens of billions of dollars upgrading their networks to deploy the 5G technology, which they say brings much faster internet services and greater connectivity.Technology companies have said 5G is safe and have accused the aviation industry of fearmongering and distorting facts.In the EU, networks operate at lower frequencies than those which US providers are planning to use - reducing the risk of interference. 5G masts can also operate at lower power. Nevertheless, some countries have taken further steps to reduce possible risks. In France, there are so-called \"buffer zones\" around airports where 5G signals are restricted, while antennas have to be tilted downwards to prevent potential interference.The UK's Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) has said \"there have been no confirmed instances where 5G interference has resulted in aircraft system malfunction or unexpected behaviour\". But it has stressed that \"different national mobile telecommunication strategies may mean that some [countries] have a higher threat exposure than others\". In a separate development, the FAA on Tuesday proposed new rules for many Boeing aircraft due to the possibility of new 5G interference. The proposed rules affect nearly 20,000 planes worldwide. They require revised flight manuals, bans on some landings, and new operating procedures for landings and approaches when dealing with 5G interference. A representative for Boeing told Reuters that the company \"continues to work with suppliers, regulators, the airlines and telecom companies to ensure long-term stability and help mitigate operational restrictions where possible\".Why your new phone could disrupt flights and ground planesMobile firms agree another 5G delay at US airportsBoeing and Airbus warn US over 5G safety concernsUS airlines warn of impending 5G flight disruption"

He said Meta was being singled out \"while allowing Chinese companies, like TikTok, to operate without constraint on American soil\". He also accused Lina Khan, who chairs the FTC, of antagonising American business. The FTC's case began in 2018, after it was revealed that the personal data of tens of millions of Facebook users had been taken by Cambridge Analytica. The regulator has looked to rein in some of the powers wielded by Big Tech. However, companies such as Meta believe they are being unfairly treated. \"Despite three years of continual engagement with the FTC around our agreement, they provided no opportunity to discuss this new, totally unprecedented theory,\" Mr Stone said.The FTC, however, believes that Meta \"has repeatedly violated its privacy promises\" and wants tougher action to protect younger users.

Paul Davis, TSB's director of fraud prevention, said he believed social media companies \"must urgently clean up their platforms\" to protect consumers.\"It's high time that social media and telephone companies took financial liability for the rising levels of fraud taking place on their platforms,\" he said.According to the most recent figures from UK Finance, which represents the banking and finance sector, 56% of the total amount lost to scams was returned to customers in the first half of 2022.Many banks, including NatWest, Lloyds and Barclays, are signed up to the  which aims to reimburse people if they fall victim to an Authorised Push Payment (APP) scam \"and have acted appropriately\".An APP scam is where a person is tricked into transferring money into an account operated by a fraudster.But TSB says it reimburses people in 97% of all fraud cases it sees, and is campaigning for others to follow suit.

        "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/business-65242843",
        "text": "It's an elegantly simple solution to an age-old problem: to protect crops from hazards, keep them covered. Nets are commonly used to keep out pests in vegetable production, particularly in high-value areas like seeds.Yet in fruit production the use of nets is still being explored and tested, according to Mirella Aoun, an agronomist and researcher at Bishop's University in Quebec, Canada, who has been studying agricultural nets for over a decade. Prof Aoun explains that initially fruit producers placed nets over trees primarily to protect them from hail damage. Now they are experimenting with nets that can protect against insects.The mesh size of insect-proof nets is determined by the local conditions, including the nature of the insects.Of course that could shut out the insects that farmers really do want - pollinators like bees. One option is to apply the nets after the pollination period. Another is to open the nets during the day, while bringing in beehives.Tree nets are particularly well established in French and Italian apple orchards, where  limit the movements and egg laying of codling moths. This has helped farmers to get rid of persistent pests and reduce their use of costly and environmentally damaging chemical pesticides. There are benefits to fruit lovers as well. \"When you know that you have less pesticide residues from crops that are under exclusion nets, it's good news for consumers,\" says Prof Aoun.Nets are also seen as a way of tackling the effects of climate change. Warmer conditions have seen the resurgence of some types of insects and diseases. Some regions are seeing more intense periods of drought and heavy rain and nets can help with that.For instance, depending on the location, the type of net, and the way it is used, a netting system can shield against the solar radiation that leads to heat stress and inhibits trees' photosynthesis. But the introduction of a net could mean a more humid environment around the tree - not helpful for crops prone to fungal diseases in wetter climates like the northeastern US and Canada.But some researchers are , where a treatment using a botanical pesticide essentially makes the nets water repellent.Photoselective (coloured) nets can also affect the penetration of light. Dark, opaque nets reduce light intensity but not light quality.Pearl-coloured nets can scatter light better so that it reaches more parts of the vegetation. Meanwhile, blue, red and yellow nets filter certain solar wavelengths and thus can stimulate specific responses in plants related to fruit quality.Fine-tuning the net usage often leads to an increase in high-calibre fruit, according to Prof Aoun. As  has shown, trees covered by coloured shade nets can produce larger and more vividly coloured fruit.Nets are not always the answer. They may not be appropriate for smaller, more varied orchards. Nor are they necessary for all climate conditions. Also, the nets used for fruit trees are typically made of polyethylene, which isn't ideal for a world attempting to move away from plastic dependence. One of the companies working on non-plastic nets is Texinov, a French technical textiles firm. Texinov is researching various types of biodegradable nets, such as ones made from flax. It has already introduced a biodegradable net made out of polylactic acid (PLA), which is produced from fermented corn. Industrial composting is needed to break down this type of net, which sales manager Adrien Etienne says is about 10% more expensive than a conventional net.Mr Etienne says that the biodegradable nets are currently more popular in Europe than in North America. This may be linked to  insecticide use. \"The nets, I think, will become more and more popular because insecticides are less popular,\" Mr Etienne says, for instance among French cherry farmers. The upfront cost has been a barrier for some farmers. \"Nets are of course a little bit expensive compared to insecticides,\" Mr Etienne acknowledges. Texinov's cheapest net sells for around \u20ac0.50 (44p) per square metre for private use in France, according to Mr Etienne. This type of net lasts for only one or two seasons, although the heavy climate protection nets can last much longer. Durability depends on factors like solar exposure. \"The nets are more and more fragile because of the sun,\" says Mr Etienne.Overall, Prof Aoun says that prices are dropping as products become more varied and accessible. \"In general the positive impact of the net is overwhelming the negative side,\" she summarises.Jean-Marc Rochon heads the apple tree nursery P\u00e9pini\u00e8re Rochon in Quebec and is keeping an eye on advances in netting.\"In my eyes, this technology is more in the development and improvement phase rather than in large-scale application,\" he says. For Mr Rochon to begin using nets on his apple trees, the cost of the netting wouldn't be the only factor. \"I see it more as a way of rethinking our ways of doing things,\" he explains. To be viable for his nursery, the netting would have to be reliable and not create a work overload. It would also need to be useable on large orchard sections.Clearly, technological refinements and communication will be necessary to convince more fruit growers that netting would be useful. But Prof Aoun believes, \"As we move toward more climatic challenges and unpredictable weather, protective cultivation using nets is the way forward.\""

        "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-65243132",
        "text": "It's being described as the most detailed ever map of the influence of dark matter through cosmic history.A telescope in Chile has traced the distribution of this mysterious stuff on a quarter of the sky and across almost 14 billion years of time.The result is once again a spectacular confirmation of Einstein's ideas.Although dark matter makes up about 85% of all mass in the Universe, it's extremely difficult to detect and defies a ready description.But dark matter influences the large scale structure of everything we see - where all the galaxies are, where the voids in space are. It's the scaffolding on which the visible structure of the Universe is hung.It neither emits nor absorbs light. The only way you can very obviously infer its presence is through its interplay with gravity. Big rotating galaxies of stars would fly apart were it not for the inclusion of some unseen mass pulling on them and keeping them intact.But dark matter will bend, or lens, background light, and this is how its whereabouts was mapped by the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT). The Chile facility observed the Cosmic Microwave Background, or CMB - a pervasive but faint glow of long-wavelength radiation that comes to us from the very edge of the observable Universe.ACT mapped the subtle distortions in this ancient light that were introduced as it passed by all intervening matter.You can liken it to the way light is bent as it passes through the bulges and bumps in an old glass window pane.If you know what you're looking at outside, you can use the distortions to say something about the glass.In the same way, the CMB can be decoded to reveal all intervening structure on its journey to us.There have been \"gravitational lensing\" detections similar to this in the past, most notably by the European Space Agency's Planck observatory a decade ago. But ACT surpasses all in terms of resolution and sensitivity.Successive experiments indicate the cosmic contents include:The Universe is calculated to be 13.8 billion years oldIn the image at the top of this page, the coloured areas are the portions of the sky studied by the telescope. Orange regions show where there is more mass, or matter, along the line of sight; purple where there is less. Typical features are hundreds of millions of light-years across. The grey/white areas show where contaminating light from dust in our Milky Way galaxy has obscured a deeper view.The distribution of matter agrees very well with scientific predictions. ACT observations indicate that the \"lumpiness\" of the Universe and the rate at which it has been expanding after 14 billion years of evolution are just what you'd expect from the standard model of cosmology, which has Einstein's theory of gravity (general relativity) at its foundation.Recent measurements that used an alternative background light, one emitted from stars in galaxies rather than the CMB, had suggested the Universe lacked sufficient lumpiness.\"It's one of the 'cosmic tensions' we all talk about,\" said Prof Jo Dunkley from Princeton University, US. \"But with this new result, we find exactly the right amount of lumpiness - no tension! So, if there is a tension, it is something that appears in the galaxy data - not in ours,\" she told BBC News.Another tension concerns the rate at which the Universe is expanding - a number called the Hubble constant.When Planck looked at temperature fluctuations across the CMB, it determined the rate to be about 67 kilometres per second per megaparsec (A megaparsec is 3.26 million light-years).Or put another way - the expansion increases by 67km per second for every 3.26 million light-years we look further out into space.A tension arises because measurements of the expansion in the nearby Universe, made using , clocks in at about 73km/s per megaparsec.It's a difference that can't easily be explained.ACT, employing its lensing technique to nail down the expansion rate, outputs a number similar to Planck's. \"It's very close - about  68km/s per megaparsec,\" said Dr Mathew Madhavacheril from the the University of Pennsylvania.ACT team-member Prof Blake Sherwin from Cambridge University, UK, added: \"We and Planck and several other probes are coming in on the lower side. Obviously, you could have a scenario where both the measurements are right and there's some new physics that explains the discrepancy. But we're using independent techniques, and I think we're now starting to close the loophole where we could all be riding this new physics and one of the measurements has to be wrong.\"Papers describing the new results have been submitted to The Astrophysical Journal and posted on the .The telescope, which worked from 2007 to 2022 before being dismantled, was funded by the US National Science Foundation. The scientific collaboration has yet to finish analysing all its data."

        "text": "Our ultimate demise is inevitable, but a growing number of experts believe how we feel in our later years may not be.They talk of \"healthspans\" - the number of healthy years of our lives.Life expectancy may have doubled over the last 150 years, but many of us have seen the undignified and devastating decline of our loved ones as they aged.To avoid that fate a new industry is emerging, promising a longevity revolution with techniques they say lead to healthier, longer lives. Business is booming for those in this space, with supplements being touted as having the ability to battle our cellular decline, and all sorts of hot and cold therapies trying to help us reduce inflammation and disease risk in our bodies. So I set out on a trip to the centre of it all, California, unsure as to whether I was arriving at the heart of a money-spinning cult, or the next frontier of medicine. Tech entrepreneur Bryan Johnson is spending millions a year trying to reduce his biological age - how old his body seems, rather than his actual chronological age, which is 45.There's a good reason for any of us to do this. Age is the highest risk factor for disease, whether it's cancer, type 2 diabetes, heart disease, or dementia, so if ageing as a whole could be delayed, then so could the risk of onset of these conditions. For him though, it's a sport.In Mr Johnson's luxurious Venice Beach home, a bedroom has been converted into a clinic where he spends many hours.He wakes at 5am, eating his first meal an hour later, followed by a second, and final one at 11am. This, combined with a forensically selected 54 pills, a mix of supplements and off-label medication, are all planned based on readings from a catalogue of tests.His days consist of a torturous exercise regime, monitoring and numerous treatments.He told me the all-over skin laser treatment he's been having has reduced his skin age by 22 years, the greatest age reduction in any part of his body.The aesthetics are just a small part of it all though, as he reminds me \"our skin is our biggest organ\". Mr Johnson was warm, logical and likeable. I left his house wanting to be (a bit) like him. Maybe I am already - I run 5km a day, try to avoid sugar, and test extreme tracking devices for fun.My colleagues considered Mr Johnson's existence joyless, so his life is clearly not for everyone.While his routine might seem extreme, every conversation I had still came back to lifestyle.\"Lifestyle is responsible for about 93% of your longevity - only about 7% is genetics,\" says Eric Verdin, chief executive of The Buck Institute for Ageing Research.\"Based on the data [if we live healthily], I would predict that most people could live to 95 in good health. So there's 15 to 17 [extra] years of healthy life that is up for grabs for all of us,\" he told me.The big question, which Mr Verdin and others are investigating, is what does a healthy lifestyle mean? Take exercise for example - should that be a daily stroll, or a HIIT class? The same goes for healthy eating. Is fasting as important as avoiding sugar? And what about a good night's sleep?You can't underestimate the obsession with sleep I came across. I met many people setting their alarms not to wake up in the morning, but to remind them to go to bed on time for a full eight hours.Well, we all set the bar at different levels.Mr Verdin practises what he preaches, his regime consisting of \"a whole lot of exercise, some fasting, good sleep, lots of social connections, very little alcohol\".His suggestion for others? \"Try to spend at least 14 hours of your 24 hours without ingesting any calories as this has a profound effect on your metabolism.\"The jury is out on how healthy this is for some women though.Keeping better track of our bodies as they age might help. Health risks could be flagged in advance and any new drugs could be applied just at the right time. Make it personalised, make it pre-emptive, make it better is the mantra.It was interesting to see that pretty much all of those working in longevity science wear more than one tracker themselves - commonly a smartwatch and a smart ring (way more convenient for sleep I can tell you - and these people are obsessed with prioritising sleep).For my part I've found health tracking illuminating. I am not diabetic, but have been fascinated by the findings of a continuous glucose monitor I wore for a while. The assumption is progress on longevity will come, albeit in a less sensational form than some may be hoping for.Experts suggest that a drug might emerge that will initially make a year or two's difference, then a few years more with the next generation, and so on.But along with such progress will come practical and ethical dilemmas.One fundamental question is whether ageing can be defined as a disease. This might simplify the approval of drugs by regulators, but risks labelling people over a certain age \"diseased\".The cost of such treatments may or may not (for developed medical systems anyway) be an issue, depending on what it turns out to be.Meanwhile, a healthier life is likely to lead to a few extra years of existence, so we may need to work longer.On my longevity learning mission, my expectations were upturned.I'd seen the sensationalist headlines, suggesting tech billionaires lounging on their yachts, deliberating over whether they fancied saving the world, going to space, or \"curing\" ageing.This wasn't the reality I saw. The wealthy have been giving money to medical research for years. This is just a new generation of wealth, and a potential new specialism of medicine. Plus it's really interesting, and affects us all.But right now, extending your healthspan involves hard work. As Silicon Valley-based journalist Danny Fortson put it: \"Exercise is hard, magic pills are easy, so that's why everyone is so excited about the pill.\"So I returned home feeling more determined than ever to live my healthiest life - sleep better, exercise without excuse, eat well, cherish social connections (yes, this was on the longevity prescription).With a bit of luck that might buy me enough time to benefit from any scientific breakthroughs."

        "text": "Instead of traditional gold bands, Czech couple Jiri and Ondrej Vedral exchanged smart rings on their wedding day.Smart rings are wearable electronic devices with functions similar to smartwatches. They typically allow the user to monitor his or her heartbeat, and make a contactless payment.It's a fast-growing tech sector, reported to be seeing Jiri and Ondrej's smart rings are, however, designed to be more romantic than most - they allow them to see and feel each other's heartbeat. Each ring is connected by Bluetooth to an app on the wearer's smartphone. And via the app two rings can be linked together.So every time Jiri presses his wedding ring, it both physically pulses with Ondrej's heartbeat, and displays the heartbeat as a moving red line. And the same in reverse for Ondrej.As long as their mobile phones are both connected to the internet, they get a real time heartbeat. If either is offline, they get the last recorded one.\"We were never into gold and diamonds,\" says Jiri. \"We wanted something different, so we liked the idea that this was something new. We feel like pioneers in this.\"The rechargeable ring, called the HB Ring, is made by Czech firm The Touch. Although the first iteration went on limited sale back in 2016, the company is now seeing an increase in global interest thanks to the wider surge in the smart ring sector.In addition, the business has this year launched a new parallel product - The Touch Locket. To be worn on a necklace, this has the same technology as the smart rings.Its target customers include engaged couples who might like the idea of being able to feel their loved one's heartbeat, but don't want to forgo having traditional wedding rings.Jiri and Ondrej are among the many couples now increasingly using tech in their wedding celebrations. From drones for wedding photography, to digital tools to help with wedding planning tasks, such as managing the budget and seating arrangements, tech has infiltrated many important aspects of the wedding day.The wedding tech trend is growing as a result of people conducting so much of their lives on their smartphones, says Zoe Burke, the lead editor for UK wedding planning website Hitched.co.uk.\"I think people just take it for granted now that you'll be able to plan your wedding through your phone. You probably met your partner through your phone,\" she says.A third of couples in the UK are now said to use WhatsApp to invite guests to their wedding, and 60%  is a series exploring how technological innovation is set to shape the new emerging economic landscape.Some people are even now using artificial intelligence (AI) software to write their wedding vows or speeches. US-based wedding planning website Joy recently launched an AI tool that can do all this for you.Called \"Wedding Writer's Block Assistant\", it is based on ChatGPT, the chatbot founded by the San Francisco-based tech firm OpenAI.Vishal Joshi, co-founder and chief executive at Joy, says that rather than killing off the romance involved in writing vows or speeches, the aim of the AI tool is to make life easier for people who have difficulty putting their feelings into words.\"We did a survey, and found 89% of respondents find it overwhelming to start writing their wedding material,\" says Mr Joshi. \"The AI tool is not supposed to replace human emotions, but for many people it's helpful.\"The global coronavirus pandemic helped pave the way for tech-based weddings, with couples that didn't postpone their nuptials getting married over Zoom or livestreaming their ceremony to guests at home.But virtual weddings now suffer from their association with Covid-19 restrictions, according to Ms Burke. \"People have moved away from livestreaming weddings. They don't want to be reminded of that time,\" she says.For couples dealing with spiralling costs brought about by higher inflation, utilising tech can save money, such as sending out e-invitations instead of posting out paper ones. This also has an environmental benefit.Rohita Pabla, a wedding planner based in London, says: \"It's about cost saving and being environmentally conscious. More and more couples are thinking about the environment.\" Making an impact on social media during the big day is also, perhaps unsurprisingly, now a huge focus for many, with couples and guests posting videos on TikTok or Instagram during the wedding and the following reception. One new development in this direction is the growing trend of hiring \"gif booths\" for the reception. These are photobooths that take short bursts of photos to create gifs, or moving images. The user then simply enters his or her mobile number, and the gif is immediately sent to their phone.\"Some [couples] want the pictures to get picked up and shared over multiple different platforms,\" adds Ms Pabla. \"They want to be the Instagram couple.\" But couples also need to cater for their less tech savvy wedding guests, or those who prefer to get their invitations the traditional way. Ms Pabla, who specialises in planning South Asian weddings, says that many couples she works with ensure they observe certain traditions alongside using tech-based solutions.For example, in traditional Indian weddings, it's customary for the bride and groom to give family members and older guests a physical wedding invitation in person.\"So the couple will get a few copies of invitations made and those will be for parents and grandparents,\" says Ms Pabla. \"But for their peers the same age they'll just send them a digital invite.\"Mr Joshi adds that wedding tech can be used to \"make everything easier and much more interesting\". Yet he cautions that at the same time you need to avoid the risk \"of losing the charm and the romance of what real weddings are about, which is essentially bringing friends and family close together\"."

In 1956, just out of university, he joined an expedition to Antarctica. Temperatures there were as low as -40C (-40F).Despite this, Lorius and two other people lived there for two years, surviving with limited supplies and a faulty radio. The more polar expeditions he led to the continent, the more he became fascinated with Antarctica's mysteries. In 1965, Lorius had a revelation by gathering ice samples and dropping them in whiskey. He spoke about it half a century later.\"One evening, after deep drilling, in our caravan we drank a glass of whiskey in which we had put ice cubes of old ice,\" he said.\"Seeing the bubbles of air sparkling in our glasses, I came to the idea that they were samples of the atmosphere trapped in the ice.\" Realising the scientific potential of analysing trapped air, he then decided to study ice cores - samples drilled out of the ice which act as frozen time capsules. By drilling into the ice, Lorius drilled into the past, penetrating, in his words, the \"ice of the first Ice Age\". His research into air bubbles trapped in the ice was published in 1987.It showed that for long periods levels of carbon dioxide varied slightly but after the Industrial Revolution concentrations of the greenhouse gas had rocketed as temperatures rose.Lorius's research brought him international renown and allowed scientists to look back over 160,000 years' worth of glacial records.The French National Centre for Scientific Research (CNRS) said it left \"no room for doubt\" that global warming was due to man made pollution. From then on he became a campaigner and in 1988 he was the inaugural expert of the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. In 2002, he was awarded the CNRS gold medal along with his colleague Jean Jouzel.

        "text": "This video can not be playedSpaceX launch: How it really went... in 59 secondsElon Musk's SpaceX company's mammoth new rocket, Starship, has exploded on its maiden flight.No-one was hurt in the uncrewed test that lifted off from Texas' coast on Thursday morning local time. After two to three minutes into the flight, the rocket - the biggest ever developed - started to tumble out of control and was soon destroyed by onboard charges.Mr Musk has said his company will try again in a couple of months.SpaceX engineers still class Thursday's mission as a success. They like to \"test early and often\" and are not afraid to break things. They will have gathered a mass of data to work towards the next flight. A second Starship is almost ready to take flight.\"Congrats @SpaceX team on an exciting test launch of Starship! Learned a lot for next test launch in a few months,\" Mr Musk tweeted.The Federal Aviation Administration, which licenses rocket launches in the US, said it would oversee a mishap investigation. A spokesman said this was standard practice when a vehicle was lost in flight.The entrepreneur had tried to temper expectations before the launch. Just getting the vehicle off the ground and not destroying the launch pad infrastructure would be considered \"a win\", he said.His wish was granted. Starship cleared its launch complex on the US-Mexico border and picked up pace as it headed out over the Gulf of Mexico. But it was evident within a minute or so that not everything was going to plan.As the rocket climbed higher and higher, it could be seen that six of the 33 engines at the base of the vehicle had been shut down or had flamed out. And three minutes into the flight, it was pretty obvious the end was near. When the two halves of the vehicle should have been separating, they were in fact still connected - and veering off course.At launch-plus-four-minutes, as Starship was losing altitude, a large explosion ripped across the blue sky, the result of computers triggering the vehicle's Flight Termination System (FTS). \"With a test like this, success comes from what we learn, and we learned a tremendous amount about the vehicle and ground systems today that will help us improve on future flights of Starship,\" SpaceX said in a statement.The top segment of Starship, also known as the ship, had taken flight previously on short hops, but this was the first time it had launched with its lower-stage.This immense booster, called simply Super Heavy, was fired while clamped to its launch mount in February. However, its cluster of engines on that occasion were throttled back to half their capability. If, as promised, SpaceX went for 90% thrust on Thursday, the stage should have delivered something close to 70 meganewtons.That's double the thrust put out by the Saturn V rocket that famously sent men to the Moon in the 1960s and 70s.Starship may not have destroyed its launch pad but later pictures indicated the forceful departure had done a fair amount of damage to concrete surfaces. The plan for the mission had been to send the ship on one near-complete revolution of the Earth, ending with a splashdown in the Pacific, a couple of hundred km north of Hawaii.There was no expectation that the ship or Super Heavy would be recovered. However, long term, this is the plan. The idea is to land both halves, refuel them and launch again - over and over.If this can be achieved, it will be transformative.Starship has a prospective payload performance to orbit of more than 100 tonnes per flight. When this is allied to the low cost of operation - principally, just the cost of fuel - it should open the door to an exciting future.\"In the industry, there's certainly a very high expectation at the potential of this vehicle for disruption,\" said space consultant Carissa Bryce Christensen.\"Its massive capacity, from a commercial standpoint, could be significant. A very large vehicle that's human-rated could be important for the emergence of space tourism. The other element is the vehicle being inexpensive. So, you've got a vehicle with two transformational aspects - massive capacity and, potentially, at a very low price,\" the CEO of BryceTech told BBC News.The entrepreneur will initially use Starship to launch thousands more satellites for his broadband internet constellation in the sky - Starlink.Only when engineers are confident in the vehicle's reliability will they permit people to fly on the rocket.The first mission has already been lined up. It will be commanded by billionaire US businessman and fast-jet pilot Jared Isaacman. He's already flown to space in a SpaceX Dragon capsule.The first flight around the Moon will be conducted by Japanese retail fashion billionaire Yusaku Maezawa. He will take eight artists with him as part of his DearMoon project.The US space agency, Nasa, wants to use a version of Starship to land its astronauts on the Moon's surface."

        "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-65399580",
        "text": "Scientists have obtained their best satellite assessment yet of the status of the world's glaciers. Europe's Cryosat spacecraft tracked the 200,000 or so glaciers on Earth and found they have lost 2,720bn tonnes of ice in 10 years due to climate change.That's equivalent to losing 2% of their bulk in a decade.Monitoring how quickly glaciers are changing is important because millions of people rely on them for drinking water and farming.The world's glaciers are distributed across all latitudes, not just at the poles. A few hundred are routinely measured at ground level - the best way to assess them. But for the vast majority, observation from space is the only way to keep an eye on how they are responding to climate change.It's important that we do that. Like the broader ice sheets, their whiteness reflects sunlight and helps cool the planet. And in many parts of the globe, glaciers also function as critical water reservoirs. More than 20% of the world's population is thought to be dependent in some way on summer melt waters that flow from glaciers - for drinking, for agriculture and to drive hydropower stations.Cryosat is a veteran European Space Agency Earth observer.It carries an instrument called a radar altimeter, which sends down microwave pulses to trace variations in height along the planet's surface - and in particular the changes in elevation of ice fields.This type of instrument works really well when monitoring the gentle undulations in the interior of Antarctica and Greenland. It finds it more tricky to measure the ice that runs across rugged terrain, such as in steep-sided valleys.But advances in data processing have enabled scientists to effectively increase the resolution and robustness of Cryosat's vision so that it can now track developments even in those hard-to-see locations.The study, reported on Wednesday , has applied this approach to the spacecraft's entire data archive to produce a global glacier assessment.The satellite's observations indicate the vast majority - 89% - of the ice loss seen between 2010 and 2020 was due to melting in an ever warmer atmosphere. Only 11% of the loss was the result of glaciers experiencing melting or increased flow because their fronts terminate in warmer ocean or lake waters.Alaska's glaciers have experienced the greatest losses. They've been losing more than 80bn tonnes a year, which equates to about 5% of the total ice volume in the region during the 10-year study period.This is very much an effect of warmer air temperatures.Places where glaciers appear to be eroding and moving faster because their fronts end in warmer waters include the Arctic - at Svalbard, the Norwegian archipelago - and in the Russian sectors of the Barents and Kara seas.Increasing ice discharge into the ocean accounts for over 50% of mass loss in these areas.\"This is a consequence of what is called the 'Atlantification' of the Arctic,\" explained Noel Gourmelen from Edinburgh University, UK.\"Usually, the surface waters of the Arctic Ocean are cold and fresh, but increasingly in some of these places the surface waters are becoming more salty and warmer as currents move up from the Atlantic. And this means glaciers are dumping more ice into the ocean,\" he told BBC News.This, of course, will add to sea-level rise which already threatens low-lying communities.Cryosat is an old spacecraft that has worked far beyond its design life. Scientists hope to get a few more years of operation from it but there's a recognition that it could fail any day now.The European Union is planning a long-term satellite series inspired by Cryosat, given the code name currently of Cristal.\"What we've shown you can do with Cryosat to measure glaciers worldwide augurs well for the Cristal mission,\" said Edinburgh colleague Livia Jakob. Ms Jakob, who led the research from her remote sensing company Earthwave, has been discussing its implications in Vienna, Austria, at the European Geosciences Union General Assembly, one of the world's biggest gatherings of Earth scientists."

        "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-65000182",
        "text": "UN chief Antonio Guterres says a major new report on climate change is a \"survival guide for humanity\".Clean energy and technology can be exploited to avoid the growing climate disaster, the report says.But at a meeting in Switzerland to agree their findings, climate scientists warned a key global temperature goal will likely be missed.Their report lays out how rapid cuts to fossil fuels can avert the worst effects of climate change. In response to the findings, UN secretary general Antonio Guterres says that all countries should bring forward their net zero plans by a decade. These targets are supposed to rapidly cut the greenhouse gas emissions that warm our planet's atmosphere.\"There is a rapidly closing window of opportunity to secure a liveable and sustainable future for all,\" the report states.Governments had previously agreed to act to avoid global temperature rise going above 1.5C. But the world has already warmed by 1.1C and now experts say that it is likely to breach 1.5C in the 2030s.The UK government responded that the report makes it clear that countries must \"work towards far more ambitious climate commitments\" ahead of the UN climate summit COP28 in November.\"The UK is a world leader in working towards net zero, but we need to go further and faster,\" a spokesperson said. Small islands in the Pacific are some of the countries expected to be worst hit by climate change. Responding to the report, the chair of the Alliance of Small Island States Fatumanava-o-Upolu III Dr. Pa'olelei Luteru said: \"While our people are being displaced from their homes and climate commitments go unmet, the fossil fuel industry is enjoying billions in profits. There can be no excuses for this continued lack of action.\" The  - the scientific body that advises the UN on rising temperatures - is agreed on by all governments involved.Their new study aims to boil down to one slim volume several landmark findings on the causes, impacts and solutions to climate change that have been released since 2018. It outlines the significant impacts that climate change is having on the world already, and explains that these will get much worse. By 2100 extreme coastal flooding that used to happen once-a-century is expected to occur at least annually in half of the world's tidal gauge locations - places where sea level recordings are made.Concentrations of the warming gas CO2 in the atmosphere are at their highest in 2 million years. The world is now warmer than at any time in the past 125,000 years - and will likely get warmer still over the next decade. \"Even in the near term, global warming is more likely than not to reach 1.5C even under the very low greenhouse gas scenario,\" the report states.\"If we aim for 1.5C and achieve 1.6C, that is still much much better than saying, it's too late, and we are doomed and I'm not even trying,\" Dr Friederike Otto, from Imperial College, a member of the core writing team for this report, told BBC News.\"And I think what this report shows very, very clearly is there is so much to win by trying.\"The synthesis shows that projected emissions of CO2 from existing fossil fuel infrastructure, such as oil wells and gas pipelines, would bust the remaining carbon budget - the amount of CO2 that can still be emitted - for staying under this key temperature threshold. And while not explicitly mentioning new projects like Willow oil in the US or the Cumbria coal mine in the UK, the scientists involved have few doubts about their impact. \"There's not a cut-off day (for fossil fuels), but it's clear that the fossil fuel infrastructure we already have will blow through that carbon budget,\" Dr Oliver Geden, from the German Institute for International and Security Affairs and a member of the report's core writing team, told BBC News.\"The remaining carbon budget in opening new fossil fuel infrastructure is certainly not compatible with the 1.5C target.\"The document argues strongly that going past 1.5C will not be the end of the world as this may only be a \"temporary overshoot\". The authors say that they are optimistic that dramatic changes can be achieved rapidly, pointing to the massive falls in the price of energy made from solar and wind. They also argue that changes driven by consumers in terms of diet, food waste and switching to low carbon transport can achieve significant cuts in emissions from many sectors. But the report also acknowledges that in addition to getting to net zero emissions as soon as possible, large scale use of carbon dioxide removal technology will be needed.Some observers have their doubts. \"We know what needs to happen, but the carbon removal part and carbon capture and storage ideas are a massive distraction,\" said Lili Fuhr, from the Centre for International Environmental Law, who attended the approval session.Responding to the report's call for more urgent action, the UN secretary general is calling for countries to bring forward their plans for net zero by a decade. \"Leaders of developed countries must commit to reaching net zero as close as possible to 2040, the limit they should all aim to respect,\" he said in a statement. He also calls on the likes of India and China who have announced net zero plans for beyond 2050 to try and bring them forward by a decade as well."

        "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-65299807",
        "text": "In his best-selling 2020 novel, The Ministry for the Future, science fiction writer Kim Stanley Robinson opens with a deadly heatwave in India which kills millions of people.The sky blazes like an \"atomic bomb\", the heat from it is a \"slap in the face\", the eyes sting and \"everything was tan and beige and a brilliant, unbearable white\". Water doesn't help because it is \"hot as a bath\u2026 worse than the air\". People die \"faster than ever\". Mr Robinson's dystopian tale about global heating might be a horror fantasy of sorts, but it is also a chilling warning. Earlier this week,  and many others were admitted to hospital after attending a government-sponsored event in an open ground under a blazing sun in Navi Mumbai in India's Maharashtra state. India is one of the countries most exposed and vulnerable to heat. Hot days and hot night events have risen significantly, and are projected to increase between two and four-fold by 2050. Heatwaves are also predicted to arrive earlier, stay longer and become more frequent.  The weather office has predicted above-average temperatures and heatwaves until the end of May. Average temperatures in India  between 1901 and 2018, partly due to climate change. Heatwaves killed more than 22,000 people between 1992 and 2015, according to official figures. Experts reckon the actual toll would be much higher. Yet, the country really \"hasn't understood the importance of heat and how heat can kill\", says Dileep Mavalankar, director of the Gujarat-based Indian Institute of Public Health. \"This is partly because we don't compile our mortality data properly.\"Prof Mavalankar should know. In May 2010, he found that the city of Ahmedabad had recorded 800 all-cause excess deaths - a measure of how many more people are dying than expected, compared to the previous few years - during a sweltering week of record-breaking temperatures. It was clear, he said, that heat was killing a lot of people. He said researchers compared the total number of deaths in the city to the maximum temperature recorded on the day, and laid down three colour coded alerts, with the red warning triggering above 45C. Prodded by these findings, Prof Mavalankar helped put together India's first heat action plan for the city of Ahmedabad. The plan kicked off in 2013 and advocated simple solutions like staying indoors, drinking lots of water before stepping out, and going to the hospital emergency if one felt sick. By 2018, he says, deaths from all causes had declined by a third in the hot, dry city. But the bad news is India's heat action plans don't seem to be working very well. (It is unclear whether the authorities in Navi Mumbai had a heat action plan in place when a million people reportedly were allowed to gather under the open sky.) A new  of 37 heat action plans at the city, district and state levels by Aditya Valiathan Pillai and Tamanna Dalal of Centre for Policy Research, a think-tank, found a lot of shortcomings.For one, most of the plans were not \"built for local context and have an oversimplified view of the hazards\". Only 10 of the 37 plans studied seem to establish locally defined temperature thresholds, although it was unclear whether they took factors like humidity into account while declaring a heatwave. \"We recommend nuancing and localising the heat hazard definition by including climate projections,\" Mr Pillai told me. One way to do it is to have more automated weather stations at village levels, according to Prof Mavalankar. Second, the researchers found that nearly all the plans were poor at \"identifying and targeting vulnerable groups\". Farm and construction workers who toil in the open, pregnant women, the elderly, and children were most vulnerable to heat. Some three-fourths of India's workers work in heat-exposed jobs like construction and mining. \"Workers are losing the ability to safely and efficiently work outside as the planet warms. It's becoming too hot and humid for them to cool themselves enough when they generate a large amount of body heat when conducting heavy labour,\" says climate researcher Luke Parsons of Duke University, North Carolina. This becomes worse during heatwaves as there are fewer safe and productive work hours during the day, he adds.Mr Pillai says that India needs \"granular understanding of which neighbourhoods have most people working in jobs where they are exposed to heat and whether they could afford to buy a cooler or afford to skip work\". He adds: \"You might have a situation where 3% of the area of the city contained 80% of the vulnerable population.\"Also most of the heat action plans seem to be underfunded, had weak legal foundations with scant accountability, and were not sufficiently transparent, Mr Pillai and Ms Dalal found.Heatwave solutions can often be simple - planting enough trees in extremely exposed and hot areas or using design choices to reduce heat gain and increase heat loss in buildings. Sometimes simple surveillance solutions such as  of a non-airconditioned hospital can protect lives, as a study in Ahmedabad found. Having worker protections in place to stop or slow work if it is too hot can help so people don't feel the need to keep working at high intensity when it's not safe, says Mr Parsons. India saw a  between 2000-2004 and 2017-2021, a recent study published in the medical journal, The Lancet, found. Exposure to heat also caused a loss of 167.2 billion potential labour hours among Indians in 2021, resulting in loss of incomes equivalent to about 5.4% of the country's GDP. But clearly, Indians are still not taking heat seriously enough. According to reports, the place in Navi Mumbai where the government ceremony had taken place had recorded a maximum temperature of 38C (100F) on Sunday. Yet, photos of the event showed thousands sitting directly under the sun with no roof or covering to offer shelter. Only a few carried umbrellas, or wrapped towels on their heads.  \"I live in Delhi where the temperature can touch 50C and I see very few people even bring out their umbrellas,\" Mr Pillai says.Heat killing many more Indians now: Lancet studyScorching heatwave affecting India\u2019s poor the mostDelhi suffers at 49C as heatwave sweeps IndiaCoal shortage sparks India's power woes"

You think trains are better than planes, but your dad books the summer holiday.Young people are some of the world's most powerful climate leaders and want rapid action to tackle the problem.It makes a lot of sense. Higher temperatures and rising sea levels will impact the youngest alive today far more than older generations. But the power to act is often still in the hands of older people, including parents.Big changes are difficult, especially when they involve other people. Where do you begin? For this year's Earth Day, we spoke to people who have successfully had tricky climate chats at home. Here are their top tips:Eating less meat is one of the best ways to reduce our impact on the planet, Ilse, 17, lives in Brighton with her parents Antonia and Sally. They used to eat meat two or even three times a day. When Ilse was 13 she decided to do more about climate change and read that cutting out meat was a good start. Sally and Antonia were sceptical at first, worried about not getting enough protein or that Ilse was too young to make that decision.\"I was thinking, you're not doing the cooking. It's a big hassle for us,\" says Antonia, saying she worried about how to cook \"nice\" Chinese vegetarian meals. After a one-day-a-week trial, they quickly scaled up and after a year were totally meat-free. \"It was daunting at the beginning, but now it's really good. There's a million recipes out there,\" Antonia adds. Ilse jumps in to say her favourite now is vegetarian fajitas, and they cook a lot of roast vegetables or lasagne. Sally says that seeing the emotional impact of the topic on her daughter helped to persuade her it was the right thing for her family. \"It's actually seeing her really stick to that commitment, even though we knew that she liked the taste of meat. That made me stop and think,\" she explains. Ilse is part of Teach the Parent, a national campaign that encourages these conversations between generations. It was started by young people frustrated with the lack of international climate action and their feelings of powerlessness, says Melanie Kee from Students Organising for Sustainability UK who helps to run the project.Even if the first conversation goes badly, Ilse says keep going. \"Big lifestyle changes take time. If you bring it up every so often, it shapes people's attitudes in the long term.\"How we travel is a , but switching from driving or flying can potentially limit family holidays and cost more.Phoebe L Hanson, a 21-year-old student from Stafford, persuaded her family to go to Cornwall instead of flying abroad. Facts are important but she advises focussing on the reasons why you care. \"Say something like, 'I'm really scared about my future, these are the reasons I want to do something',\" she suggests.  Her mum Tracy explains that as Phoebe got older, their relationship changed from Tracy explaining facts to her to meeting in the middle to share knowledge.Present a solution, not just a problem, Phoebe explains. \"Give them options for something fun or exciting.\" \"Saying 'let's do this thing instead' is really good way to communicate,\" she suggests.  She also says one answer to concerns about money is to discuss what type of world parents want children to inherit. \"People talk about how expensive trains are, but think about what the carbon emissions from taking a plane mean in the long term for us,\" she says.Radically reducing what we buy and throw away can improve our carbon footprint, but it can be time-consuming and difficult.Becky Little, who is 20 and a community carer in Worcester, persuaded her parents Rob and Ellen to reduce food waste and think more carefully about what they buy.\"Be well-informed about the things you want your family to start changing so they can see you care and have done some research,\" she says.Her parents were concerned about convenience but she focussed on the positive impacts. \"Explain why it will make their lives easier or cheaper,\" she suggests.\"Make connections with things they care about,\" she advises. Her family like to volunteer so they made meals using leftover food to donate to people in their local community.\"It's important to not go into it expecting them to change their whole lives. Small things can make a difference,\" she explains.Ilse, Phoebe and Becky all say that the conversations can be challenging at times but worth it. \"Taking action as an individual mean I've managed to feel a lot more in control of my future,\" Phoebe explains.

Labour, the Liberal Democrats and even the Green Party have capitalised on the shrivelling of Tory popularity.Liberal Democrat smiles were sufficiently broad that party leader Sir Ed Davey was found comparing himself to a Cheshire cat.The Lib Dems appear to have finally banished the baggage of their years in coalition government.Plenty of Lib Dems are proud of their time serving alongside the Tories between 2010 and 2015, but plenty of their voters were horrified by it and they were near obliterated eight years ago.Memories of it for many seem to have retreated sufficiently far into the rear-view mirror that it is no longer a drag anchor on their prospects.\"We are the none-of-the-above party again,\" one party source observed.This was the Green Party's best ever set of local election results.For the first time, they've secured a majority on a council, in Mid-Suffolk.The only Conservative comfort blanket on an otherwise cold night for them is the scale of a bounce back Labour has to make to win a general election.Some have suggested the numbers from this election suggest they would have fallen short of a majority had there been a general election this week.This video can not be playedWatch: England's local elections...in under 60 secondsLabour are continuing to insist these local elections results would have led to a majority Labour government, because of progress they believe they can make in Scotland, plus the geographical distribution of their vote share.Party strategists reckon, with all the problems the Scottish National Party is facing, they could win 20 seats in Scotland at the next general election. They currently hold one.And Labour say their vote is much more \"efficient\" than it has been.What do they mean by this?They point out Labour won the general election in 2005 on 35% of the vote, but lost in 2017 with 40% of the vote, because the party was stacking up voters in places where it was already dominant - such as big cities and university towns.They argue this week's results show, for them, a much better distribution of their vote in places they need to beat the Conservatives - including good performances in places that voted to leave the EU and places with smaller proportions of graduates.This weekend, the recriminations are under way among Tories.Those around Prime Minister Rishi Sunak say he has done much to steady the Tory ship and the party would be in a far worse state without him.Let me invite you to peer into my notebook to see what is scribbled there after my phone rang earlier.A figure loyal to former Prime Ministers Boris Johnson and Liz Truss telling me: \"Rishi has no option but to own these results.\"And they didn't stop there. . There is little enthusiasm, though, to move against the prime minister.The Tory party's appetite for insurrection, civil war, utter chaos appears sated.But Mr Sunak's capacity to put a lid on Conservative anger appears weakened. His critics are finding their voices again.The biggest truth is a political landscape that appears hyper-competitive and so far from definitive.From today's vantage point, it looks hard for either the Conservatives or Labour to be super confident of winning a majority to call their own at the next general election.And that election could be around 18 months away - and a lot can happen in that time.Labour see a path to victory. The Conservatives still think, still hope, that path can be blocked.Oh and one final thought.I suspect the Conservatives and Mr Sunak are mighty glad the small matter of King Charles's Coronation will wipe politics off the news for the next few days.Tory losses a clear rejection of Sunak, says LabourSir John Curtice: What election results mean for the partiesVoters express anger at ID rule changes"

        "text": "This video can not be playedWatch: John McFall shows how his prosthetic leg works in a weightless environmentJohn McFall is the European Space Agency's first ever para-astronaut, selected to study how feasible it is for someone with a physical disability to live and work in space. BBC News joined him on board a parabolic flight, where he experienced weightlessness for the first time.One minute John McFall is lying on the floor of a plane. The next, he starts to float upwards, still horizontal, seemingly levitating towards the ceiling.He looks astonished - everyone on this far-from-normal flight does, as they slowly rise into the air. The sensation of being weightless, no longer pinned down by gravity, is extraordinary. You feel totally out of control - because you are. Any tiny movement against something solid sends you catapulting around the cabin, bouncing into walls and people. It's like being in a slow-motion pinball machine.A smile begins to form across John's face - he starts laughing. \"It's brilliant, it's amazing,\" he says.Then suddenly, the weightlessness is gone and he falls to the ground.John is an astronaut candidate with a difference - he's an amputee. When he was 19 he lost his leg in a motorcycle accident, and now uses a high-tech prosthesis. He has now been recruited by the European Space Agency (Esa) to take part in a ground-breaking study assessing how to make spaceflight accessible to people with physical disabilities.\"I saw that the European Space Agency had announced that they were looking for an astronaut with a physical disability,\" he says, \"and I looked at the person specification and thought, 'Wow, that's me - I would love to give that a go'.\"John's used to pushing himself to the limit. After losing his leg and learning to walk again with a prosthesis, he took up running - for fun at first, then competitively. He went on to win a bronze medal in the 100m at the 2008 Beijing Paralympics. He then decided to become a doctor and is currently working as a trauma and orthopaedic registrar in Hampshire, but he's had to pause his medical career - the opportunity to work with Esa was too good to turn down. \"I'm very much following my heart and I'm following my curiosity,\" he explains, \"and I'm following my passion for science and life.\" I've joined John on board a specially adapted aircraft to take a parabolic flight. As the plane flies steeply upwards, we experience extra gravity - about twice as much as usual - where your whole body is pressed down into the floor.Then, as the plane gets ready to nosedive back down, there's a moment when we become weightless for about 20 seconds. It's not that gravity has vanished, we're still bound by the laws of physics. Instead, we're actually in freefall - as is the plane around us - but this reproduces zero-gravity conditions. The plane repeats this manoeuvre again and again. This video can not be playedWatch: The BBC's Rebecca Morelle struggles during her first experience of weightlessnessThere's a reason parabolic flights are nicknamed \"vomit comets\" - it's like riding on a mid-air rollercoaster.Thankfully, I don't feel sick, but it's safe to say I'm not a natural astronaut.I tumble, out of control, squealing, asking for help to come down. But I end up pinned to the ceiling - until the period of zero-gravity comes to an end, and I crash down like a sack of potatoes. Luckily the floor of this plane is well padded.Meanwhile, John is faring much better, soaring around and gaining confidence with every period of \"zero-gravity\". The prosthesis John wears is technologically very complex, incorporating a microprocessor, hydraulics, a gyroscope, accelerometers and other force sensors.\"All those things together make the knee know where it is in space and how fast it's bending or straightening,\" John says.He's assessing how well his prosthetic leg is operating in this unusual environment, and the challenge comes when weightlessness kicks in.\"You'll probably see I'm floating around with my leg out straight, because that gravity isn't there,\" he explains. \"So it's harder for me to turn quickly - because my leg doesn't want to bend. I'm just getting used to that and working out how I can move myself in zero-g, but each parabola is a learning opportunity.\"John thinks that his prosthesis may be too high-tech for this environment, and a simpler one might fare better. And this is the whole point of his project with Esa: working out exactly what needs to be adapted for a person with a physical disability to spend time in space. It will cover everything, from pre-mission training, to looking at whether a spacecraft would have to be modified to accommodate John's needs. But he says everyday life in a microgravity environment is still the biggest unknown.\"Will I wear a prosthesis? And if I wear a prosthesis, will I have to have something that will accommodate variations in volume in my stump? Would I be able to run on a treadmill in space? Will we have to adapt a spacesuit for a spacewalk? If so, in what ways?\" he wonders. \"All these questions are things we do not have answers for.\"John is acutely aware that his disability is specific to him, and he needs to take that into account while he's undertaking the study.   \"I haven't got a spinal cord injury, I haven't got cerebral palsy, or spina bifida. So I'm thinking about how this applies to other disabilities as well - but we have to start somewhere.\"There's a wider impact too. John hopes the project will redefine people's expectations of what someone with a physical disability can do.As the flight nears its end, John keeps working on and improving his zero-gravity skills. He's now moving about easily and can even land standing up, while I continue to thwack down to the floor, every time.When this project comes to an end, John isn't guaranteed a mission to space, but as the plane starts its preparations for landing, I ask if this experience has whet his appetite for space, or made him have second thoughts about his new job. \"It's given me even more hunger and excitement,\" he says with a huge grin. \"It's just awesome - I can't wait.\" Follow Rebecca .Disabled man joins Europe's astronaut programmeESA - Parastronaut feasibility project"

        "text": "This video can not be playedWATCH: Meteosat-12 takes a picture of the weather systems below it every 10 minutesThe first images from Europe's new weather satellite, Meteosat-12, have just been released.The spacecraft, which sits 36,000km above the equator, was  and is currently in a testing phase that will last most of this year.When Meteosat-12's data is finally released to meteorological agencies, it's expected to bring about a step-change in forecasting skill.Warnings of imminent, hazardous conditions should improve greatly.This is something called \"nowcasting\" - the ability to say with greater confidence that violent winds, lightning, hail or heavy downpours are about to strike a particular area.Part of this advance will come from the increased resolution of Meteosat-12. For previous generation satellites, a feature in a storm had to be at least 1km across to be detected. The new spacecraft will track features as small as 500m in diameter.\"We can now see very fine structures,\" said Jochen Grandell from Eumetsat, the intergovernmental agency that manages Europe's weather satellites.\"You may have heard the term 'overshooting top', for example, which is a part of a thunderstorm's cloud development where you might see very strong updrafts and downdrafts. These are very rapidly changing, and they are very small as well. But they are also very powerful,\" he told BBC News.\u00a0This video can not be playedWATCH: European countries share the cost of running the Meteosat systemEurope has had its own meteorological spacecraft sitting high above the planet since 1977. The new imager is the third iteration in the series.Meteosat-12 sits in a \"stationary\" position, keeping a permanent eye on Europe, the Middle East and Africa.It will return a full picture of the weather systems racing across Earth's surface at a rate of one every 10 minutes, five minutes faster than has been the case up to now. It also views the planet in more wavelengths of light. Sixteen instead of the previously available 12.\u00a0The additional bands of light allow for true colour images. In other words, the pictures are much closer to what the human eye might perceive if looking down from the same vantage point.\u00a0\"The first time we received the data, there were huge emotions because we could see the high quality of the sensor,\" recalled Eumetsat colleague Alessandro Burini.\u00a0\"The optical quality of the images, of the radiometry, of the navigation - in other words the accuracy of the position of the individual pixels in an image - is really very good.\"The new third-generation system will eventually comprise a trio of spacecraft working in unison.A second imager will go up in 2026 to acquire more rapid - every 2.5 minutes - pictures of just Europe. Before that, in 2024, a \"sounding\" spacecraft will launch to sample the temperature and humidity down through the atmosphere.With replacement satellites already ordered for the first working threesome, Europe is guaranteed coverage well into the 2040s.\u00a0The overall cost is expected to be about \u20ac4.3bn (\u00a33.7bn).\u00a0If that sounds like a lot of money (and it is), it pales next to the value society accrues from accurate weather forecasting - in preventing loss of life, infrastructure damage and economic disruption.\u00a0Repeated analyses have judged the benefits to be worth tens of billions every year across Europe as a whole.BBC Weather presenter and meteorologist Simon King was excited to see the new imagery.\"It's like going from standard definition to 4K,\" he said. \"The increase in resolution is quite remarkable. When you zoom in you can really see the cloud structure. And it's not just cloud, you can see very clearly as well the dust in the atmosphere, which is important for hurricane development for example.\"Nata\u0161a Strelec Mahovi\u0107 works at Eumetsat, training people how to use data from space. She's previously worked as a meteorologist in Croatia.\"Another example I would name as a consequence of higher resolution would be fog detection because we can now see fog even in very narrow valleys,\" she explained. \"And maybe another application I would emphasize is wildfire monitoring, as [Meteosat-12] will not only see much smaller fires better and see the smoke, but the channels on [Meteosat-12] will allow us to see the differences even in fire intensity.\"Testing of the satellite and ground systems will continue through this year. National forecasting agencies, such as the UK Met Office, Meteo France and DWD (the German Meteorological Service), should be ingesting Meteosat-12 information into their supercomputers on a routine basis early in 2024."

        "text": "Hopeful for Labour, encouraging for the Liberal Democrats and the Greens, but only a little short of calamitous for the Conservatives. These are the key messages to have emerged from the ballot boxes.After all but 40 of the results were declared, Labour had made a net gain of nearly 450 seats, the Liberal Democrats well over 250, and the Greens more than 180. The Conservatives, in contrast, had lost more than 800 seats and seem at serious risk of losing 1,000 seats in the final tally.Meanwhile, Labour had gained control of 17 councils, and the Liberal Democrats seven.  Labour had particular reason to be pleased with its successes in Middlesbrough, Medway, Plymouth, Stoke-on-Trent, and Swindon, all of which were by far from guaranteed to fall into Labour's lap. Among the Liberal Democrats' gains were Windsor and Maidenhead, and three councils in Devon - in the middle of their traditional former heartlands in the South West. However, these gains only tell us who is up and who is down since the last time most of the seats were contested. That was in May 2019, when both the Conservatives and Labour were low in the polls in the wake of splits over Brexit. They do not address the big question which politicians, commentators and the public want answered - namely, is Labour on course for a potential general election victory next year, as the polls suggest?To answer that we need to take an in-depth look at votes cast. The BBC has collected the detailed ward by ward voting figures in 45 of the 230 councils where elections were held on Thursday and used these to estimate the projected national share. This represents an estimate of what the outcome would have been if all of Britain had had the chance to vote on Thursday, and those places that did not vote had followed the example of those that did.According to this estimate, the Conservatives would have won 26% of the national vote, down two points on their poor performance in 2019 though a little above the worst ever local election outcomes for the party (in 1995 and 2013). Labour's 35% puts them nine points ahead of the Conservatives, the largest lead that Labour has recorded in any local election since it lost power in 2010. Nevertheless, while Labour's Projected National Share was seven points up on what it achieved in May 2019, the party's tally is no better than its score in last year's local elections. This raises questions about whether the outcome was more an expression of discontent with the government than enthusiasm for Labour's alternative.Labour themselves were keen to emphasise that the results showed the party was ahead in many key parliamentary constituency battlegrounds. Whilst true, that achievement too was much more the result of how much worse the Conservatives performed than at the December 2019 general election than because Labour were consistently winning bigger shares of the vote than in the last parliamentary contest.Labour will, however, be pleased to have registered an above average performance in wards that voted heavily Leave in 2016. Recovering the support of Brexit-backing Britain has been one of the key objectives of Sir Keir Starmer's leadership.The Liberal Democrats continue to struggle to register progress in general election vote intention polls, but traditionally perform more strongly in council elections. They were defending one of their best performances in local elections since they went into coalition with the Conservatives in 2010. They will no doubt be pleased that their share of the vote (20%) edged up a point on 2019, taking it to the highest level since 2010. That said, the Liberal Democrats will be disappointed that in wards where they are challenging the Conservatives locally, there is little sign so far of them winning the tactical support of third-placed Labour supporters. Securing such tactical votes could well be crucial to the party's chances of capturing seats from the Conservatives at the next general election.Given the difficulties smaller parties typically have in winning seats under the first-past-the-post electoral system, the Greens have done well to make more than 180 gains. And, for the first time ever, they have gained overall control of a local council: Mid-Suffolk. In terms of votes, the party has so far performed close to the record level of support won four years ago. Politics at Westminster might be dominated by the Conservatives and Labour, but the political stripes of English local government are now rather more variegated."

Lucy Terry, who was accompanied by her sisters and daughter, said: \"We're all excited. We've been looking forward to it for ages. We're big supporters of the monarchy.\"Ms Terry travelled from Newcastle to meet up with relatives for the occasion.She told BBC Scotland: \"We always wanted to see the coronation here in Edinburgh. \"It feels like we're witnessing history which is particularly important for my daughter to grow up and remember it. She can say 'Oh I was there on that day'.\" Jimmy Crombie, from Edinburgh, was also at the Ross Bandstand, on his first day off for 12 days.The 70-year-old electronics worker said: \"I just wanted to see what's going on.\" In Edinburgh's west end, a peal of bells rang out from St Mary's Episcopal cathedral which features Scotland's only twelve bell church tower. Bell ringer Barbara Bell said she did not have strong views on the monarchy, but believed the Coronation was a great chance to come together and celebrate. At the ceremony in Westminster Abbey, the Scottish government was represented by First Minister Humza Yousaf, Lord Advocate Dorothy Bail KC and the Permanent Secretary John-Paul Marks.Mr Yousaf wore a Slanj kilt in the Spirit of Glasgow tartan with an Asian fusion-style jacket and waistcoat designed by Glasgow-based Anjali Modha.His wife Nadia El-Nakla was dressed in a full-length kilt made from the same tartan by Scottish designer Siobhan MacKenzie, and a hat by Glasgow milliner William Chambers.Other dignitaries included Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross, Scottish Parliament Presiding Officer Alison Johnstone, ex-prime minister Gordon Brown and former lord advocate Dame Elish Angiolini KC.Several hundred other Scots also travelled down to witness the first event of its kind for 70 years from the streets.Before the ceremony Graham Smith, the head of anti-monarchist campaign group Republic, was among six demonstrators .Meanwhile, Dylan Theedam Parry was among those who volunteered to look after the crowds in Hyde Park.The 19-year-old, from Lauderdale Scout Group in the Scottish Borders, said: \"We woke up at 3 o'clock this morning to get here to arrive at Hyde Park at 5am.\"We are here to look after the public and hand out flags for people to wave.\"The atmosphere is lovely. It's a big honour to be here today.\"Dylan is one of 150 people nominated to travel down to London and work as a volunteer over the historic weekend.He added: \"Just witnessing the Coronation is something special. I wouldn't have made the trip down here if it hadn't been for the Scouts, so it's an honour.\"The ceremony was also streamed at live at Glasgow Cathedral. On Sunday, Glasgow's Lord Lieutenant Jacqueline McLaren will officially mark the occasion during a ceremony in George Square.It will be followed by a parade to a thanksgiving service at the cathedral.The  ceremony, which is due to begin at 09:45, will include a guard of honour inspection, speeches and then three cheers for the the King and Queen, followed by the national anthem.On Friday, King Charles' former school Gordonstoun held its own Coronation for pupils to learn more about the ceremony.Hamish Montgomery, six, played the part of King Charles and Jessica Cook, seven, took up the role of Queen Camilla. When asked if he had any advice for the King ahead of the Coronation, Hamish said: \"Have a bath.\" Jessica added: \"And porridge for breakfast\". More than 100 Gordonstoun students volunteered to start the official Coronation day with a morning run and open water swim. The activity by the King's former school was inspired by a daily timetable from the 1960s, which was recently discovered in the school archive.The Aberdeenshire village of Ballater, which has boasted a close royal connection since Queen Victoria was on the throne, was awash with red, white and blue.Ballater was one of the first places King Charles visited after the death of his mother, where he thanked residents for their support of the late Queen Elizabeth II on her final journey from nearby Balmoral.Hundreds of people attended Big Lunch events on the village's Church Green.Wendy Cobban, a businesswoman in the village who helped organise the charity fundraisers, said: \"I think that the local residents feel a more personal relationship with the King and Queen, they are looked upon as friends and neighbours.\"Erskine Home in Renfrewshire, part of the Erskine veterans charity, also celebrated the Coronation.Jessie Dewar, 99, from Knightswood, Glasgow, and Jessie Ellingham, 94, originally from Barrhead, Renfrewshire, remember watching the late Queens's coronation in 1953. Ms Ellingham recalled: \"We didn't have a television so we went to a friend's house. It was a wonderful thing to see.\"She said she never expected to see two coronations in her lifetime, adding: \"We're happy Charles is having his day.\"Erskine Home was officially opened by King Charles in October 2000.Scotland's most northerly event is being hosted in Scalloway in Shetland on Saturday, where the island's youth centre's celebration featured sea shanties and dancing.Co-organiser Sonia Inkster said the Big Lunch - of which Queen Camilla is a patron - is \"a firm fixture in our calendar each and every year and this time it's extra special.\"Meanwhile, it has been confirmed that King Charles will travel to Scotland for a historic ceremony in the weeks after his Coronation.Following the footsteps of his mother in 1953, the King will be presented with the Honours of Scotland - the Scottish crown jewels.King Charles and Queen Camilla will be guests of honour at St Giles' Cathedral in Edinburgh for the national service of thanksgiving and dedication.The date has yet to be announced, but is expected to be in the summer.Frontline workers to receive Coronation medalKing to retrace mother's state visit to Scotland"

In remarks with analysts, Apple chief Tim Cook spotlighted growth in India, where the firm is investing heavily and which he visited last month to open the company's first two official stores in the country. \"Overall I couldn't be more delighted and excited by the enthusiasm I'm seeing for the brand there,\" he said. Apple is one of the most valuable companies in the world and its sales are closely watched as a sign of retail strength.The company said it was facing a \"challenging macroeconomic environment\", echoing comments by other companies which have warned that customers, hit by the rising cost of living and economic uncertainty, are pulling back. Apple had warned investors that sales in the January-March period could fall by as much as 5% year-on-year. But the results were buoyed by a 1.5% year-on-year increase in iPhone sales, which hit $51.3bn - a record for the quarter. The company said that was lifted by strong demand in south Asia and Latin America. In India, where the firm's overall sales grew by double digits, Mr Cook said he saw big growth opportunities as the country's middle class expands, saying the country was at a \"tipping point\".  Apple's services unit, which includes Apple Music, Apple News and Apple Pay, saw sales rise 5% year-on-year to more than $20bn.In Europe, where many other firms have reported weakness, sales gained more than 2%. However, sales sank more than 7% in the Americas, its biggest market. Profits also fell more than 3% year-on-year, to roughly $24.2bn. But that was better than expected, as supply chain problems receded. Apple's report follows a series of updates from other tech giants, including Facebook-owner Meta and Alphabet, parent company of Google, which had also been better than expected.Tim Cook launches India's first Apple StoreApple sales in biggest fall since 2019Facebook owner Meta\u2019s profits exceed expectations"

        "text": "India's population has reached 1,425,775,850 people, surpassing the number of people in mainland China, according to the UN's estimates. India's decennial census - scheduled to be held in 2021 - has been delayed, so there's no official population data. China's most recent - and seventh census - was conducted in 2020. To estimate and project populations of both India and China, the UN relies on information about levels and trends in fertility, mortality and migration acquired from records, surveys and administrative data. What is clear is that both India and China have more than 1.4 billion people each, and for over 70 years have accounted for more than a third of the global population. China's population is likely to begin shrinking next year. Last year, 10.6 million people were born, a little more than the number of deaths, thanks to a rapid drop in fertility rate. According to the UN, the Chinese population will continue to fall and could drop to below a billion before the end of the century.  India's fertility rate has also fallen substantially in recent decades - from 5.7 births per woman in 1950 to two births per woman today - but the rate of decline has been slower. India's population is virtually certain to continue to grow for several decades - the UN expects the population to peak around 2064, and then decline gradually. So what does India overtaking China as the most populous country in the world mean? China reduced its population growth rate by about half from 2% in 1973 to 1.1% in 1983.Demographers say much of this was achieved by riding roughshod over human rights - two separate campaigns promoting just one child and then later marriages, longer gaps between children and fewer of them - in what was a predominantly rural and overwhelmingly uneducated and poor country. Investments in public health and increased education for women and their participation in the workforce, among other things, also contributed to the decline in fertility.India's population more than trebled in the six decades after independence - from 361 million people in 1951 to more than 1.2 billion in 2011.India saw rapid population growth - almost 2% annually - for much of the second half of the last century. Over time, death rates fell, life expectancy rose and incomes went up. More people - especially those living in cities - accessed clean drinking water and modern sewerage. \"Yet the birth rate remained high,\" says Tim Dyson, a demographer at the London School of Economics.India launched a family planning programme in 1952 and laid out a national population policy for the first time only in 1976, about the time China was busy reducing its birth rate. But  of millions of poor people in an overzealous family planning programme during the 1975 Emergency - when civil liberties were suspended - led to a social backlash against family planning. \"Fertility decline would have been faster for India if the Emergency hadn't happened and if politicians had been more proactive. It also meant that all subsequent governments treaded cautiously when it came to family planning,\" Prof Dyson says. East Asian countries such as South Korea, Malaysia, Taiwan and Thailand, which launched population programmes much later than India, achieved lower fertility levels, cut infant and maternal mortality rates, raised incomes and improved human development earlier than India.India has added more than a billion people since independence in 1947, and its population is expected to grow for another 40 years. But its population growth rate has been declining for decades now, and the country has defied dire predictions about a \"demographic disaster\".So India having more people than China is no longer significant in a \"concerning\" way, say demographers.Rising incomes and improved access to health and education have helped Indian women have fewer children than before, effectively flattening the growth curve. Fertility rates have dipped below replacement levels - two births per woman - in 17 out of 22 states and federally administered territories. (A replacement level is one at which new births are sufficient to maintain a steady population.)According to Pew Research Center, all religious groups in India have shown , based on data available in India's decennial census and the National Family Health Survey (NFHS).As a result there have been only \"modest changes\" in the religious make-up of the people since 1951.Fertility rates among all religious groups have declined, according to official data. The decline in birth rates has been  than in the more populous north. \"It is a pity that more of India could not have been like south India,\" says Prof Dyson. \"All things being equal, rapid population growth in parts of north India have depressed living standards\".It could, for example, strengthen India's claim to a permanent seat in the , which has five permanent members, including China. India is a founding member of the UN and has always insisted that its claim to a permanent seat is just. \"I think you have certain claims on things [by being the country with largest population],\" says John Wilmoth, director of the Population Division of the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs.The way India's demography is changing is also significant, according to KS James, director of the Mumbai-based International Institute for Population Sciences. Despite drawbacks, India deserves some credit for managing a \"healthy demographic transition\", by using family planning in a democracy which was both poor and largely uneducated, says Prof James. \"Most countries did this after they had achieved higher literacy and living standards.\" More good news: one in five people below 25 years in the world is from India and 47% of Indians are below the age of 25. Two-thirds of Indians were born after India liberalised its economy in the early 1990s. This group of young Indians have some unique characteristics, says Shruti Rajagopalan, an economist, in . \"This generation of young Indians will be the largest consumer and labour source in the knowledge and network goods economy. Indians will be the largest pool of global talent,\" she says. India needs to create enough jobs for its young working age population to reap a demographic dividend. Only 40% of India's working-age population works or wants to work, according to the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE). More women would need jobs as they spend less time in their working age giving birth and looking after children. The picture here is bleaker - only 10% of working-age women were participating in the labour force in October, according to CMIE, compared with 69% in China.Then there's migration. Some 200 million Indians have migrated within the country - between states and districts - and their numbers are bound to grow. Most are workers who leave villages for cities to find work. \"Our cities will grow as migration increases because of lack of jobs and low wages in villages. Can they provide migrants a reasonable living standard? Otherwise, we will end up with more slums and disease,\" says S Irudaya Rajan, a migration expert at Kerala's International Institute of Migration and Development.Demographers say India also needs to stop child marriages, prevent early marriages and properly register births and deaths. A  at birth - meaning more boys are born than girls - remains a worry. Political rhetoric about \"population control\" appears to be targeted at Muslims, the country's largest minority when, in reality, \"gaps in childbearing between India's religious groups are generally much smaller than they used to be\", according to a Demographers say the ageing of India receives little attention.In 1947, India's median age was 21. A paltry 5% of people were above the age of 60. Today, the median age is over 28, and more than 10% of Indians are over 60 years. Southern states such as Kerala and Tamil Nadu achieved replacement levels at least 20 years ago. In Kerala, for example, the rise in population between 2001 and 2011 was lowest (4.9%) among states. A newborn in the state can expect to live for 75 years, against the national average of 69. Smaller families here ensure that children are educated well. This leads to the young migrating quickly within and outside the country for opportunities, leaving their parents at home.The UN estimates that between 2023 and 2050, the number of people aged 65 and above is expected to nearly double in China, and to more than double in India, \"posing significant challenges to the capacity of healthcare and social insurance systems\".\"As the working-age population declines, supporting an older population will become a growing burden on the government's resources,\" says Rukmini S, author of Whole Numbers and Half Truths: What Data Can and Cannot Tell Us About Modern India. \"Family structures will have to be recast and elderly persons living alone will become an increasing source of concern,\" she says."

        "text": "A scheme in south London is trying a new approach to property ownership: flats that are only for sale to local people, at prices set according to what local people earn.\"My old landlord actually hugged me, she was so happy for me when I finally got my own place,\" says Alex Ingram. The 41-year-old civil servant is delighted with his new one-bedroom flat in Lewisham, in the recently completed Citizens House, a four-storey block of 11 homes.For the past 18 years Alex has either rented, lodged or lived in flat-shares in London.This flat cost him \u00a3215,000, about 35% cheaper than similar places nearby.That's because he didn't buy it on the open market. He bought it through a community land trust (CLT). About 500 locals developed his building with the help of Lewisham Council, the Greater London Authority (GLA) and London CLT, a non-profit that helps neighbourhoods set up and run CLTs.The locals decided issues like planning, design and, perhaps most importantly, sale prices.This is calculated by looking at average local income levels, which the flats will continue to track.Only people who can prove a strong connection to Lewisham for five years - through living or working there - can apply. Alex has lived in Lewisham for eight years. Also in his favour, he has been involved with a local charity called Wheels for Wellbeing, which helps disabled people get into cycling.Other qualifying criteria include being able to get a mortgage, having a child in a local school and showing a demonstrable housing need. The initiative aims to help people who are priced out of their local area but who aren't eligible to be on the council's housing priority list. An independent panel decides on the applications.Because the prices are fixed, these flats are unlikely to appeal as an investment or \"nest egg\". An \"asset lock\" means the flats can only be sold on the same terms on which they were bought.\"I didn't have another option,\" says Alex. \"The existing model of investing in a home doesn't work for me.\"But I think it's better that I have a home that has a stable value. I now have something to start from.\"The site for Citizens House was donated for free by Lewisham Council, one of the reasons the scheme is financially viable. The land had previously been occupied by a set of disused garages. It has taken a decade of community campaigning to get the building completed.However, London CLT believes it can speed up the process and is developing six other projects in the capital, in areas such as Greenwich, Shadwell and Lambeth. There are 350 legally incorporated CLTs in England and Wales, according to the , with 200 more forming. However, the vast majority of these trusts offer properties for rent rather than for sale.The open market leaves property prices open to speculation, and can result in foreign buyers investing in flats which then lie empty.But at least it is clear who has the right to purchase properties in this system - the person who bids the most money.What if CLT flats are oversubscribed and someone feels they were wrongly passed over?\"A robust, fair and transparent process for deciding what sort of homes will be created and who will live in them is vital,\" says Beth Boorman of CLT Network, \"and housing needs can differ from area to area.\"Each CLT draws up its own rules and some even use a lottery system to whittle down appropriate candidates.\"No system for buying houses is perfect,\" points out property expert Henry Pryor. He believes CLTs, which have cross-party political support, are part of the solution to the UK's housing shortage. There are some obstacles to them becoming a significant part of the housing mix though, he adds.They rely on finding redundant land that is not available for development.And, when residents move out, they will find that house prices in the open market have appreciated more than their homes, which may be an issue if they wish to buy elsewhere.Christian Codjoe, 30, is due to move into his flat in a few weeks.He currently lives with his parents. He had saved for a deposit but feared he would have to move to Croydon or Kent to buy a home.\"Interest rates are crazy right now, but even with high mortgage payments the CLT flats are 100% worth it and get me on the housing ladder,\" he says.Christian thinks his application was successful because he has lived in Lewisham his whole life, attends a local church and his current home is due to be demolished for a private development.Fellow resident Kes Gill-Martin, 35, has just moved into a one-bedroom flat with his partner, and agrees. \"Affordable housing is very scarce and finally owning a home is transformative for us.\"This place feels like a massive change in our personal world, but such a small change in terms of what society needs.\" What is happening to house prices?Shortfall of homes to rent creates frenzied market"

        "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-65458136",
        "text": "In India's bustling airports, the counters of one airline are conspicuously empty.Earlier this week, budget airline Go First  and cancelled its flights for a few days. While the airline has assured refunds to customers, its agents are busy fielding calls from irate passengers. Reports say that lessors of 20 aircraft to Go First have also asked India's aviation regulator to deregister them, paving the way for their return.The chaotic scenes bring back memories of 2019 when Jet Airways, which was India's biggest airline at the time, went bust. Go First is the first major Indian airline in four years to follow Jet.The National Company Law Tribunal heard its bankruptcy plea on Thursday - the airline has asked for interim directions from the court to allow it to function, and also sought restrictions on any adverse action from the regulator. Go First says its woes are not due to financial mismanagement but rather, because of engine issues. The company says in its bankruptcy filings that it has not missed a single debt repayment deadline so far.It has blamed US engine maker Pratt & Whitney for having had to ground many of its planes \"due to the ever-increasing number of failing engines\" supplied by it - this, the airline says, caused a severe cash flow problem.Go First says it was forced to ground 25 aircraft - about half of its fleet of Airbus A320neo planes - leading to about 108bn rupees ($1.3bn; \u00a31bn) in lost revenue and expenses. According to aviation analytics firm Cirium, Go First was scheduled to operate 6,225 flights in May, equating to over 1.1 million seats.The airline has accused Pratt & Whitney of not following an order by an emergency arbitrator, which included supplying \"at least 10 serviceable spare leased engines by 27 April 2023\".Pratt & Whitney said in response that it was \"complying with the March 2023 arbitration ruling\" and it could not comment further as \"this is now a matter of litigation\".Around 90% of Go First's fleet is made up of A320neos with Pratt & Whitney engines. Since 2020, the planes have been grounded due to non-availability of spare parts and a delay in the supply of retrofitted engines from the engine maker. Having almost half its fleet unavailable had affected flight schedules and led to frequent cancellations. Go First was the fifth largest airline in India based on scheduled departures. Its management has said that the airline's owners - the Wadia Group - have no plans to exit. The insolvency proceedings are aimed at reviving the airline and not selling it, Go First's CEO Kaushik Khona told Reuters news agency.The Indian aviation sector has grown at a fast pace. But several airlines have also been grounded or forced to consolidate due to financial distress from increased competition, excessive debt and rising costs - Jet Airways, Kingfisher Airlines, Air Deccan, Paramount Airways and MDLR airlines to name a few. Jet Airways has so far been unable to restart operations despite getting approvals as it is facing a lengthy insolvency process.Mark Martin, founder and CEO of aviation consultancy firm Martin Consulting, says this is the first time an India-based airline is collapsing due to a component supply issue.Go First says that it was a consistently profitable airline with a gradual expansion strategy till 2020, when it was hit by the problem of serial engine failures. The deterioration in the company's financial performance was also exacerbated by the pandemic, which hit air travel, the company said in its bankruptcy filing.Some of Go First's leased planes have been repossessed by leasing companies due to non-payment of rental dues. Oil marketing companies had sought an immediate payment model and as revenues shrank, it was finding it hard to make daily payments for fuel.Despite consistent investments from the Wadia Group - 32bn rupees in three years - and an emergency credit line from the government (set up to help businesses cope with the impact of the pandemic), the airline's operations stalled.Go First's collapse underscores the fierce competition in the country's airline sector, which has seen one of the  post the pandemic.Domestic airlines carried more than 37.5 million passengers in the first three months of 2023, up 51.7% compared from a year ago. According to CAPA Centre for Aviation, India's domestic air traffic is expected to rise to 350 million passengers by 2030.The Go Air crisis may help rivals such as IndiGo, Air India, SpiceJet and new entrants like Akasa Air grab a larger chunk of the market share. But customers won't have such a good time. Fares on Go First's routes are expected to jump sharply by as much as 50-60% in the next three-four months, reckons Mr Martin. \"If Go First shuts down, more than 50 aircraft will be grounded. Other airlines are also strapped. The demand is quite high and existing airlines do not even have the capacity to cater to that,\" he says.Experts say the industry will also have to contend with engines and aircraft supply chain issues.IndiGo, the country's biggest airline by market share, has also been affected by the Pratt and Whitney engine glitch. Between IndiGo and Go First, 60 aircraft have been grounded due to lack of spare parts. But IndiGo is in a better place as it has a fleet of more than 250 aircraft, many of which run on other engines.SpiceJet has been battling financial distress and posting huge losses every quarter. It has also been plagued by an  in the past year, with the airline regulator keeping a close watch. However, the overall growth story of the Indian aviation market is still intact, and will mostly be driven by two or three players, experts say.In November, the country's second and third largest carriers - Air India and Vistara - announced that . In February, Air India also  by ordering 470 aircraft from Europe's Airbus and US-based Boeing."

        "text": "Two days before Christmas, TikTok called London-based journalist Cristina Criddle to tell her two of its employees in China, and two in the US, had viewed user data from her personal account without her knowledge or consent.\"It was just really chilling and horrible and, personally, quite violating,\" she says.\"I was at my family home with my teenage sister, teenage cousins - and they all use TikTok all of the time. They were like, 'Whoa, should we be worried?'\". What happened to Cristina - a Financial Times technology correspondent and a friend and former colleague of mine - is what TikTok and its parent company, ByteDance, have consistently denied happens at all, which is why she has decided to tell BBC News about it.TikTok has confirmed members of its internal audit department looked at the location of Cristina's IP address - the unique number of a device - and compared it with the IP data of an unknown number of their own staff, to try to establish who was secretly meeting with the press. They \"misused their authority\" to do this and were acting unauthorised.Cristina does not know for how long she was tracked, or how often, but she does know it happened last summer.\"If my location was being monitored 24/7, that's not just limited to my actions at work - which wouldn't be OK even if it was - but this was in my personal life as well,\" she says. It was when I was out with my friends, when I was going on holiday, all of that stuff's in there.\"The real threat and the real chilling thing is that I was just trying to do my job.\"Cristina's TikTok account was on her personal mobile handset - and in the name of her cat, Buffy. Her own name and occupation were not mentioned in the bio. She had about 170 followers and over three years or so had uploaded some 20 videos of Buffy, viewed, on average, a couple of hundred times.Like most social-media networks, TikTok collects quite a lot of information about its account holders, including:Western users' data is never accessed or stored inside China, it says. And the staff responsible for the data breach of Cristina and a handful of other Western journalists, last year, were fired for misconduct. TikTok owner Bytedance said it \"deeply regrets\" what was \"significant violation\" of its code of conduct and was \"committed to ensuring this never happens again\".  Last summer, Cristina had been talking to TikTok staff unhappy with company practices. The data breach had failed to identify her sources, TikTok said. She says it may also have breached the EU's strict General Data Protection Regulation, which states users have to actively consent to how their data is used. There are large penalties for companies failing to comply.For now, Cristina has kept her account open because she still needs to be able to access TikTok for work - but the app now lives on a dummy handset kept at her workplace. And she has curtailed both her own and Buffy's social-media use across other platforms as a result of what happened.\"I have really had to think about my safety - mostly my digital safety,\" she says.\"I'm super-careful now. I have to make sure that there is no chance that my devices are being tracked. I have to make sure that my sources are aware of the possible challenges to their safety as well.\"Cyber-security expert Prof Alan Woodward, from Surrey University, said this level of tracking \"cannot be described as accidental or even incidental\".\"Someone had to do some extra digging to work out that the cat account was in fact Cristina,\" he said.TikTok is fighting for survival in the US and there is restricted access to it on official devices in several other countries. ByteDance is headquartered in Beijing - although, it also has offices in Europe and the US - and there are concerns it could share Western users' data with the Chinese state if requested.Nevertheless, it remains wildly popular, with more than 3.5 billion downloads worldwide.

My belief is that is not the case,\" Mr Ere\u00f1o said. Countries need to consider how to minimise disruption to routine healthcare in any future pandemic, he believes.\"That is something that cannot happen again. We cannot stop the normal delivery of healthcare to people that need us,\" says Mr Ere\u00f1o, pointing to pregnant women and cancer patients.\"The planning was not good, we cannot empty the hospitals and the clinics just for [a disease like] Covid, and allow people who were going through very severe episodes to stay at home.\"Bupa offers private healthcare insurance to 24 million customers globally. It has 82,000 employees and had a turnover of \u00a314bn last year.It also runs its own clinics and hospitals, such as the Cromwell Hospital in London.In some countries like Spain its hospitals were used for the treatment of Covid patients. More than half of Spanish hospitals are privately run.Mr Ere\u00f1o believes hospitals need to be ready to be segregated, or alternatively, separate hospitals could be designated for just treating infected people in a future pandemic.Making sure hospitals in the UK are better prepared for a future pandemic is a good idea but may be hard to implement, says Paul Elkington, professor of respiratory medicine at Southampton University.\"Another pandemic is inevitable,\" he says, \"but since Covid-19 the NHS has been hit by a sequence of challenges including staff striking across the sector, the Ukraine war creating supply chain disruption and high energy costs. With all these day-to-day issues it's very hard for NHS managers to focus on the next pandemic.\"He says investment would be needed to modify buildings to have things like \"clean entrances\" for non-infectious people. While private healthcare providers stepped in during the pandemic to help clear non-urgent care waiting lists, this is not ultimately sustainable, says Prof Elkington.Mr Ere\u00f1o also questioned whether countries had enough personal protective equipment (PPE) in stock.\"Do we have already all the protective equipment [we need in every country] ready just in case there is another pandemic? My guess is that not in every place. It is not happening as it should be. \"But we have the protective equipment we need for our people [in Bupa].\" The British Medical Association (BMA) released  last year that was critical of PPE preparedness in the NHS prior to the pandemic.Prof David Strain, chair of the BMA board of science, says that more needs to be learned.\"Large stockpiles alone aren't enough: the PPE we have must be fit for use. The medical workforce is diverse, which means we need PPE for different face and body shapes, varying hair textures, head coverings, and facial hair. This was a failing at the outset of the pandemic and still hasn't been addressed for those NHS staff dealing with Covid today.\"A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: \"We are committed to learning lessons from the pandemic and have already concluded a review of emergency preparedness measures, which includes PPE, that need to be available in the event of a future pandemic.\"This is already making a difference, helping to ensure our future hospitals can adapt to changing health needs as part of our New Hospital Programme.\"An independent public inquiry into the Covid-19 pandemic was set up in the UK last year, chaired by Baroness Heather Hallett.

It changed a policy on animal testing to align with EU chemical rules, according to a High Court ruling.The High Court said on Friday that the government was acting legally after a case was brought by animal rights activists.  they are \"dismayed\" by the government's new position.A Home Office spokesperson told the BBC: \"We are pleased that the High Court has agreed with the Government's position in this case. The government is committed to the protection of animals in science\".Animal testing for makeup or its ingredients had been completely banned in the UK since 1998. Animal testing had only been allowed if the benefits gained from the research outweighed any animal suffering, for example for medicines. But in 2020 the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA), an EU agency which oversees chemical regulation, ruled that companies needed to test some ingredients used in cosmetics on animals to ensure they were safe for workers manufacturing the ingredients.During the case it was revealed that since 2019 the government had been issuing licences for animal testing of cosmetic ingredients in line with EU chemical rules, which it retained despite leaving the EU in 2020. This could include testing chemicals commonly found in foundations and concealers . It is not known how many such licenses were issued or to whom.Cruelty Free International (CFI), which brought the case, argued this was illegal and in breach of the animal testing ban for makeup and its ingredients, which has stood since 1998. Mr Justice Levin ruled in favour of the government, saying that the change in policy still met existing laws, although he said it was \"regrettable\" the public had not been informed.The change in the government's position has been heavily criticised by major beauty and cosmetic brands, including Unilever, Body Shop and Boots. Most major brands have long campaigned to end animal testing. Cruelty Free International said it was \"outrageous\" that the government had effectively lifted the ban. Christopher Davis, director of activism and sustainability at the Body Shop said they would \"campaign vigorously\" against the changes.\"Allowing animal testing for cosmetics would be a devastating blow to the millions of people who have supported campaigns to end this appalling practice,\" he told the BBC after the ruling.The ingredients that may be tested on animals include homosalate  - a common sunscreen ingredient used already in many foundations and skincare products. In low doses homosalate is safe but in higher concentrations the evidence for Manufacturers can now apply for licenses to undertake animal testing before production begins, to ensure the safety of workers. But they still cannot undertake any animal testing to check the safety of the makeup for consumers. This should be done using other methods.Mr Justice Levin said that nothing was stopping the government from introducing an absolute ban on animal testing of makeup products if it desired.Cruelty Free International CEO Michelle Thew said: \"The case shows clearly that [the government] was prioritising the interests of contract-testing companies over those of animals and the wishes of the vast majority of British people who are strongly opposed to cosmetics testing.\"CFI said it would appeal the decision made by the court and ask the government to reinstate the complete ban in the UK. Dr Julia Fentem, head of the safety and environmental assurance centre at Unilever - one of the world's largest cosmetic companies - said tests potentially required under the new policy were \"unnecessary\", and that safety tests could be carried out without animal involvement. A new chemicals strategy is expected to be published this year outlining the government's position on the use and testing of chemicals in the UK - which may include further guidance to cosmetic companies.'Forever chemicals' still in use in UK make-upWhich animals are used in UK experiments?"

        "text": "The nations of the world are due to meet at the COP27 summit in Egypt, to try to agree far-reaching action on climate change.They are under pressure to improve on landmark commitments they made seven years ago in Paris.The Paris Agreement saw almost all the world's nations - for the first time - support a common strategy to cut the greenhouse gas emissions which cause global warming.Adopted by 194 parties (193 countries plus the EU) in the French capital on 12 December 2015, the treaty came into force .US President Donald Trump , but his successor . Some of the key discussions in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt will be about whether and how countries are building on what they promised in Paris.When the agreement was signed, governments admitted the targets set would not be enough to limit global warming to 1.5C. At the COP26 climate summit held in Glasgow in 2021, some countries brought forward new targets. But even with these pledges, global warming would still only be limited to 2.1C, according to the independent .Parties were again asked to submit more aggressive targets for reducing emissions before COP27 to align with the Paris goal, but only 25 of the 194 have come up with improved commitments.It is expected that South Africa and Indonesia will announce funding plans to phase out fossil fuels, and it is hoped that more countries will sign up to the methane, finance and deforestation pledges drawn up at COP26.COP27 will also host one of three technical reviews as part of the \"global stocktake\" (GST). This is where countries review whether their plans are strong enough to prevent temperatures rising above 1.5C, using analysis prepared by UN officials and scientists. It is hoped the process will strengthen the case for further action. The Paris Agreement restated a commitment made in 2009 that the world's richer countries should provide $100bn (\u00a387bn) annually by 2020 to help developing nations deal with the effects of climate change, and build greener economies.But in 2019 only $79.6bn was raised. A recent UN report  - even though a new and more ambitious target is supposed to be set for 2025.For many countries, this is the biggest issue to resolve at COP26 - and the very poorest are urging action.Developing countries are also demanding that \"loss and damage finance\" be included as an agenda item. This is specific compensation to cover losses they are already incurring from the effects of climate change. But developed nations fear any agreement would suggest they accept liability for global warming and would be tied into decades of repayments.Although the Paris Agreement laid out a clear target point, it did not contain the specific detail on how to reach it. The ambition is to create a \"net zero\" world by 2050. That means reducing greenhouse gas emissions as much as possible, and removing any remaining emissions from the atmosphere, through natural or artificial processes.Scientists argue it is vital to assess the progress being made towards that goal every year. The UN group of climate experts, the IPCC, has estimated an annual budget of carbon emissions the world can release before temperatures rise above 1.5 degrees, measured in gigatonnes of CO2 equivalent (GtCO2e). In 2018, that the world should only release 25-30 GtCO2e per year by 2030. It currently emits 36.3 GtCO2e per year, . The priority of COP27 will be to develop a specific plan of action to bring that figure down, and - as in Paris - secure international support for the way forward."

This means taking the carbon emissions out of electricity generation is important.UK governments have been relatively successful in cutting emissions from electricity generation. These . This is largely due to a substantial reduction in electricity generated from coal - the dirtiest fossil fuel - from 40% in 2012 to less than 2% last year. The proportion of electricity generated by renewables has grown to around 40% in the last few years, up from just over 10% a decade ago. Fossil fuels - mainly natural gas - still generate about 40% of UK electricity. The remainder comes from nuclear power and imports. The government has set ambitious targets to accelerate the expansion of low carbon energy to reduce reliance on natural gas. These include by 2030 and .

The world faces a huge challenge, but there are potential solutions.Climate is the average weather in a place over many years. Climate change is a shift in those average conditions.The rapid climate change we are now seeing is caused by humans using oil, gas and coal for their homes, factories and transport. When these fossil fuels burn, they release greenhouse gases - mostly carbon dioxide (CO2). These gases trap the Sun's heat and cause the planet's temperature to rise.The world is now about 1.1C warmer than it was in the 19th Century - and .Temperature rises must slow down if we want to avoid the worst consequences of climate change, according to climate scientists.

        "text": "The Green Party has claimed a historic victory after taking  in Mid Suffolk. How did it win the hearts and minds of voters in this traditionally Tory area?Sweet shop owner Jan Arundel voted for the Green Party for the first time, having always voted Conservative in the past.\"I never expected to vote for the Greens but I'm really worried about the future and we all need to start thinking about it,\" she says.Living in the small rural village of Crowfield, she has seen lots of banners and placards in support of the Greens.The party was already the main opposition on Mid Suffolk, a council where no single party had a majority, and last year it stepped up its campaigning and leafletting in the district, which includes the towns of Stowmarket, Needham Market and Eye.But Jan says she was still shocked to learn how well the party had done by doubling its number of councillors to 24, giving it a significant majority on the 34-seat council.\"I just hope this brings about some change; I've lost faith in the Conservatives; there are so many scandals coming out and I wanted to give someone new a chance,\" she says.\"They can't do any more harm than the current government is doing.\"In Stowmarket, Emily Clarke decided to stick with the Green Party, having also voted for them in the past.Party leaders chose Stowmarket as the place to launch their national campaign for these elections, and Emily says their presence has really been felt in the market town.\"I really think they will be able to effect some change,\" she says.The 33-year-old wanted to show her support for a local councillor who runs a shop in the town who is \"so passionate about Stowmarket\".\"Stowmarket is a fantastic place. I really think having someone like him will be able to push it a bit further,\" she adds.At Westminster, Stowmarket is part of the Bury St Edmunds constituency, represented by the Conservative MP Jo Churchill. The eastern side of the Mid Suffolk council district is part of the Central Suffolk & North Ipswich constituency, represented by another Tory - Dr Dan Poulter.In Stowmarket, longstanding Green Party supporter Gareth Betts Davies hopes the council can \"showcase what success might look like\" and \"get other people believing\".\"People are really starting to notice the impact of climate change,\" he says. \"Locally they are a really active and engaging party. They're quite different as well here - the Green Party is typically seen as quite a young party, but here it has a broad appeal and I think that has made a difference compared to other areas in the country.\"Steve Ambrose voted for the Green Party for the first time, because of \"events over the last few years\".The 62-year-old says he could not bring himself to vote for the Conservatives any more, insisting he has \"gone to the other side now\".He hopes the Greens will bring some regeneration to Stowmarket town centre, which lies on the busy A14 trunk road between Bury St Edmunds to the west and Ipswich and the Port of Felixstowe to the south east. \"The town centre needs some help and they need to try and improve services generally for the community,\" he added.In the neighbouring, smaller town of Needham Market, Francis Codling has just come out of a pub to find that her vote helped the Green Party gain control of the council.Waiting at a bus stop, she says she feels \"delighted\" but \"not surprised\" because the party has had a big presence in the local community recently.\"I have always voted for the Lib Dems, but the Greens are doing a lot here locally so I knew it wouldn't be a wasted vote,\" she says.The 81-year-old has got four children, eight grandchildren and six great-grandchildren, who she was thinking about at the polling station.\"That's one of the main reasons why I wanted to vote for the Greens. I'm worried about their future and I'm worried about the climate. I want there to be a world here for them to enjoy. I really hope they can do something about it.\"Best ever local election results for GreensGreens secure first outright council victoryGreens predict further gains after winning first councilLabour aims for No 10 after Tories suffer heavy local defeatsLabour increases majority on Ipswich councilMid Suffolk District Council"

        "text": "Almost one-in-ten of the the country's MP's has been invited to meet with HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC) about a tax scandal affecting hundreds of people.The request has come from Suffolk Conservative MP Jo Churchill, in whose constituency the firm at the centre of the controversy is based.She said people impacted came from 68 constituencies from across the UK.Former clients of the firm are facing four and five figure bills from HMRC. Apostle has denied any wrongdoing. Suffolk Police announced last week that  following almost two hundred complaints and referrals. Ms Churchill is meeting HMRC's Director of Individuals and Small Business Compliance, Marc Gill, next week. Her constituency covers Stowmarket where Apostle Accounting's office is located.She said: \"At this meeting I will press HMRC to ascertain how they are supporting constituents and that they recognise the importance and impact this situation is having on clients of Apostle Accounting across some 68 constituencies currently.\"Ms Churchill added that each MP representing these constituencies had been notified and invited to attend.The exact number of people affected is unclear but one former Apostle client, Lee Osborne, has compiled a list of people who say they had received a rebate, or had been notified by HMRC they now owe money.Mr Osborne, from Sawtry in Cambridgeshire, says he is facing a bill \"north of \u00a320,000\". So far he has been contacted by 466 people who have told him they need to pay back, or expect to have to pay back, approximately \u00a32.13m between them. He said he hoped \"HMRC can see that we as individuals never intended to do anything wrong and we need their forgiveness and empathy to help us\".\"People feel despair and hopelessness right now, they need help\" he added.Apostle Accounting offered a service that submitted tax rebate claims based on work-related expenses to HMRC.Many former clients received large pay-outs between 2016 and the end of 2021, but HMRC has since written to them stating the claims had been disallowed and the recipients were not entitled to the money.   In a previous statement issued through its lawyers, Apostle Accounting blamed HMRC for what had happened.It denied any allegations of \"non-compliance issues and/or fraudulent tax claims\".They added HMRC had reviewed Apostle's approach to the expense claims in 2019 and found it to be acceptable.HMRC's actions, according to independent advice quoted by the firm, \"appeared to be wrong, outside the law and its own guidance\".HMRC said: \"You should be cautious about promises of easy money - if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is. Handing over sensitive personal information could leave you having to pay back the full value of any invalid claim made on your behalf, as taxpayers are legally responsible for their own tax affairs. \"We have a legal duty to collect the right amount of tax, so can review claims from previous years to make sure the tax rules are applied correctly and identify any errors that may have been made.\"We take firm action against agents that do not comply with the law or breach HMRC's Standard for Agents, including issuing penalties, suspending claims or refusing to deal with an agent. We also work with professional bodies to set the standard expected for professional agents.\"eastofenglandnews@bbc.co.uk"

        "name": "Coronation order of service in full",
        "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-65503950",
        "text": "King Charles' Coronation takes place at 11:00 on Saturday 6 May, with an elaborate and lengthy ceremony.The occasion is steeped in Anglican liturgy, from the singing of hymns to the taking of bread and wine in the eucharist.Other elements are unique to the Coronation.We've got , but read on for the full, unabridged details of the ceremony, its music and pageantry, as listed in the official order of service.PreambleWhen William, Duke of Normandy, defeated King Harold at Hastings in 1066, he was determined that he should be seen as the legitimate king of England. He set his sights on being crowned in the new Abbey Church that Edward the Confessor had built beside his Palace at Westminster. For almost a thousand years, Westminster Abbey, with the Shrine of St Edward, King and Confessor, at its heart, has remained the place of coronation for our Monarchs.The rite of Coronation in England, which is really a series of ancient rituals, has its roots in the ninth century and was codified in the fourteenth in a book called the Liber Regalis, which the Abbey still possesses. It was further modified over the following centuries, adapting to changing needs.Today's service draws on that long tradition, set once again within the context of the Eucharist, which is the defining act of worship for the Church universal. Bible passages will be read from the letter to the Colossians and the Gospel according to St Luke; the Archbishop will preach a short sermon; hymns will be sung; and bread and wine will be offered, consecrated, and received by The King and Queen, to strengthen and guide them in their public service.Early in the service His Majesty The King turns to each of the four points of the compass and is recognised by his peoples as their 'undoubted King', who acceded immediately upon the death of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II.A Bible is presented to The King, upon which he swears oaths to govern the peoples with justice and mercy and uphold the Churches. Then, for the first time at a Coronation, The King prays publicly for grace to be 'a blessing to all ... of every faith and belief' and to serve after the pattern of Christ.After the sermon, the ancient hymn Veni, Creator Spiritus is sung in languages from across the United Kingdom, calling on the Holy Spirit just before the most sacred part of the Coronation rite - the anointing with holy oil. A Screen shields The King from view as he sits in the Coronation Chair for this most solemn and personal of moments. Beneath him, the Cosmati pavement symbolises the whole cosmos on the Day of Judgement, when Christ will judge all things in his mercy; the King of kings, whom all Monarchs are called to reflect, and to whom all must give an account.Once anointed, The King is vested in priestly garments that symbolise both humility (the Colobium Sindonis) and splendour (the Supertunica, Stole, and Robe); reflecting the two natures of Christ who 'though he was in the form of God ... emptied himself ... being born in human likeness' (from Philippians 2: 6-8). The King represents humanity restored to its full dignity and glory in Christ, as 'a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation' (1 Peter 2: 9).Various items of regalia are presented to The King, each a visible reminder of his great responsibility under God. There are Spurs and Armills, which would have been worn by a medieval knight, and a Sword which The King first wears and then offers in the service of God. Then come the symbols of secular and spiritual power: an Orb, representing the world under Christ; a Sceptre with Cross, representing earthly power, held in a restrained, gloved hand; and the Sceptre with Dove, representing spiritual authority exercised chiefly in mercy. There is also a Ring symbolising the faithful 'marriage' of a Monarch to his peoples. In particular, those presenting the regalia to The King reflect the diversity of the United Kingdom and its peoples, in striking contrast to seventy years ago. A moment of great symbolism follows when the Archbishop places St Edward's Crown on The King's anointed head, all cry 'God Save The King', a fanfare is sounded, the Abbey bells are rung, and gun salutes are fired.The King then moves from the Coronation Chair to his Throne in the centre of the Abbey and is encouraged by the Archbishop to 'Stand firm and hold fast', confident in God 'whose throne endures for ever.' Once enthroned, The King receives Homage (a promise of allegiance and faithfulness, recognising his spiritual and earthly authority), first from the Archbishop of Canterbury, then from His Royal Highness The Prince of Wales, and finally the opportunity for the congregation and people elsewhere to participate in various ways. Before joining The King, enthroned alongside him in the centre of the Abbey, The Queen is herself anointed and crowned, and presented with her own items of regalia.The Liturgy of the Sacrament, with the giving of Holy Communion to The King and Queen, constitutes the remainder of the service, after which they retire into the Chapel of St Edward to prepare for the final procession.In 1547, Archbishop Cranmer preached at the Coronation of Edward VI:The Almighty God of his mercy let the light of his countenance shine upon your majesty, grant you a prosperous and happy reign, defend you, and save you; and let your subjects say, Amen.Throughout the changing centuries, the Coronation Service has held together hopes both for our immediate and our eternal destinies. It has been and still is an occasion for prayer. Today we pray for our King, and pray with him, for a nation united and rejoicing in its diversity, and, ultimately, for a world healed and reconciled in the eternal banquet of the saints in heaven.Procession of faith leaders and representativesProcession of the Commonwealth RealmsProcession of the King and QueenWAS glad when they said unto me :We will go into the house of the Lord.Our feet shall stand in thy gates,O Jerusalem.Jerusalem is builded as a city,that is at unity in itself.Vivat Regina Camilla!

And there was delivered unto him the book of the prophet Isaiah.

Do this, as oft as ye shall drink it, in remembrance of me.Wherefore, O Lord and heavenly Father, we thy humble servants, having in remembrance the precious death and passion of thy dear Son, his mighty resurrection and glorious ascension, entirely desire thy fatherly goodness mercifully to accept this our sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving; most humbly beseeching thee to grant that by the merits and death of thy Son Jesus Christ, and through faith in his blood, we and all thy whole Church may obtain remission of our sins, and all other benefits of his passion. And although we be unworthy, through our manifold sins, to offer unto thee any sacrifice, yet we beseech thee to accept this our bounden duty and service, not weighing our merits, but pardoning our offences; and to grant that all we, who are partakers of this holy communion, may be fulfilled with thy grace and heavenly benediction; through Jesus Christ our Lord, by whom, and with whom, and in whom, in the unity of the Holy Spirit, all honour and glory be unto thee, O Father Almighty, world without end. Amen.Let us pray with confidence as our Saviour has taught us:All sit or kneelOUR Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name; thy kingdom come; thy will be done; on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread. And forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us. And lead us not into temptation; but deliver us from evil. For thine is the kingdom, the power and the glory, for ever and ever. Amen.O LAMB of God, that takest away the sins of the world, have mercy upon us.O Lamb of God, that takest away the sins of the world, have mercy upon us.O Lamb of God, that takest away the sins of the world, grant us thy peace.- Tarik O'Regan (b 1978), composed for this serviceLet us pray.O ALMIGHTY Lord, and everlasting God, vouchsafe, we beseech thee, to direct, sanctify, and govern both our hearts and bodies, in the ways of thy laws, and in the works of thy commandments; that through thy most mighty protection, both here and ever, we may be preserved in body and soul; through our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. Amen.Our help is in the name of the Lord:Who hath made heaven and earth.Blessed be the name of the Lord.Now and henceforth, world without end. Amen.CHRIST our King, make you faithful and strong to do his will, that you may reign with him in glory; and the blessing of God Almighty, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, rest upon you, and all whom you serve, this day, and all your days.- The choir sings Amen.

        "text": "Adidas has said the ending of its collaboration with Kanye West is \"hurting\" the business, with sales in North America hard hit.The sportswear giant cut its ties with the designer and rapper, known as Ye, late last year after he posted anti-Semitic comments on social media.West designed trainers under the Yeezy brand and Adidas said the loss of the business cut sales by \u20ac400m (\u00a3350m) in the first quarter of the year.Overall, total revenue fell by 1%.Despite the dip, the figures were better than analysts had been expecting and Adidas said that sales were up 9% when the impact of the Yeezy business was excluded.Adidas said it was benefiting from the current trend for \"terrace\" style trainers and was seeing \"extraordinary demand\" for its Samba, Gazelle and Campus brands.Terrace styles are those that were originally popular among football fans in the 1980s, when supporters first embraced designer fashion brands such as Fila and Sergio Tacchini.While Adidas said it had a limited supply of such shoes at the start of the year, it plans to increase production in the coming months.In its latest results, Adidas said sales in North America had fallen by 20% as the region was particularly affected by the ending of the Yeezy business.Adidas chief executive Bjorn Gulden said the loss of Yeezy is \"of course hurting us\".The company scrapped its tie-up with West in October last year following the rapper's anti-Semitic comments. At the time, the firm said: \"Adidas does not tolerate antisemitism and any other sort of hate speech.\"Adidas said that if it decided not to \"repurpose\" its remaining unsold Yeezy stock, this would hit its operating profit by \u20ac500m this year.The company still has to decide what to do with the remaining products, and whether it will sell them or scrap them.Mr Gulden the firm was narrowing its options on the Yeezy stock, and the company was getting \"closer and closer\" to a decision.Pippa Stephens, senior apparel analyst at GlobalData, said that while Adidas was \"unable to reverse its past mistakes, it must now quickly come to a decision on what to do with its remaining Yeezy stock, to avoid angering its investors even further\".\"Should it decide to sell it, it risks damaging its brand reputation even further, so must ensure it does so sensitively to avoid upsetting customers.\"The company is being sued by investors who claim Adidas knew about Kanye West's problematic behaviour years before it ended their partnership.Investors allege Adidas failed to limit financial losses and take precautionary measures to minimise their exposure.In response, Adidas said it rejected \"these unfounded claims\", adding that it would take \"all necessary measures to vigorously defend ourselves against them\".Despite the drop in overall sales during the first three months of the year, Adidas reported a higher-than-expected operating profit of \u20ac60m.Strong demand for its football, running and tennis shoes helped footwear revenues grow by 1%.However, Mr Gulden - who joined Adidas at the start of this year from rival Puma - warned that 2023 would be \"a bumpy year with disappointing numbers\".He also said that Adidas was aiming to make sure that 50% of the products it sells in China are designed specifically for the Chinese market.China is the world's second largest sportswear market, but Adidas has been falling behind its rivals there.In the first three months of the year, its sales in China were down 9.4% from a year earlier.Adidas sued by investors over Kanye West dealAdidas Kanye West's Yeezy shoes 'collectors' items'Adidas warns of losses from Kanye West fallout"

        "text": "The British public is refusing to let typical bank holiday weather spoil its Coronation plans and is gearing up for street parties and family celebrations. Around \u00a3200m will be spent on food and drink this weekend, according to the Centre for Retail Research (CRR).Supermarket chain Lidl said it had sold enough bunting to line the Coronation procession route 75 times over. Party products and traditional British fayre are in high demand and brands are offering royal-themed ranges.Overall the CRR expects consumers to add more than \u00a31.4bn to the UK economy over the long weekend.Tesco said it was on track to sell 675,000 pork pies and 300,000 pots of clotted cream.Sales of quiches, the King's chosen Coronation dish, have leapt across the country - Aldi said it was selling more than 30 every minute and Waitrose said it had seen an increase of 25% in the last week. Scones too are flying off the shelves - at Aldi they are up a massive 150%, Tesco expected to sell 600,000. Dozens of products from pork pies and golden syrup to gin and elderflower cordial have gone purple and gold or tweaked their branding to feature Buckingham Palace, crowns and bunting. Ikea is offering a coronation chicken flavour sauce on its famous meatballs.Tesco's Maheen Piracha said shoppers were in a mood to celebrate: \"Judging by early sales, King Charles' Coronation is set to spark a feel-good factor with plenty of street and house parties.\" No street party would be complete without a tipple - Tesco anticipated it would sell 180,000 bottles of Pimms and Asda said beer sales were expected to be 25% higher for the three-day weekend.Sales of flags, bunting and paper plates have also sky rocketed - Asda said sales of Union Jack flags were up 227%, and Coronation cups were up 135%.  Aside from food and drink, millions is being spent on Coronation souvenirs and memorabilia. Owners of King Charles spaniels - and other breeds too -  may be preparing to dress their pooch for the occasion, courtesy of Gateshead company Franky's Bowtique. Founder Kerry Whitney said she had been \"running around like a headless chicken\" over the past fortnight to complete more than a thousand orders for crowns, bandanas and bow ties. \"We're busy at Halloween and Christmas anyway and we didn't know how popular it would be because everyone loved the Queen so much, but it's just snowballed,\" she said. The CRR forecast \u00a3245.91m would be spent on Coronation coins, tokens and medallions, celebratory teapots, mugs, cups and other crockery. Asda said its Coronation cushion and King Charles teapot had proven popular and it had sold 3,000 of each respectively. John Lewis said sales of its Coronation spoon were strong. Halcyon Days holds a royal warrant and makes Coronation plates and souvenirs from its factories in Stoke on Trent and the Midlands. Chief executive Pamela Harper told  demand had been \"absolutely extraordinary\" in the last few months.\"The whole royal memorabilia is still very much alive and kicking. We've got the gifting market and our international market in London driven by international tourists, particularly the Americans, coming in droves, coming to buy a piece to take home.\"The CRR said spending by additional foreign tourists could be as high as \u00a3323m with much of it spent on accommodation, restaurants and shopping in London. Extended pub opening hours over the bank holiday should provide a boost to the hospitality sector to the tune of \u00a3104m according to the Centre for Economics and Business Research. \"This would boost spending on any given weekend, but the special occasion of the Coronation itself should likely compound this by providing a special spending buzz, not unlike that seen during major events such as the Football World Cup,\" it said.

And on Wednesday, the head of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), Lina Khan, outlined her views on how and why AI There are concerns that AI could rapidly replace peoples' jobs, as well as worries that chatbots like ChatGPT and Bard can be inaccurate and lead to the dissemination of misinformation.There are also concerns that generative AI could flout copyright law. Voice cloning AI could exacerbate fraud. AI generated videos can spread fake news.However, advocates like Bill Gates have hit back against calls for an AI \"pause\" saying such a move would not \"solve the challenges\" ahead. Mr Gates argues it would be better to focus on how best to use the developments in AI. And others believe there is  - which would give a strategic advantage to tech companies in China.

        "text": "Imagine this: You've shattered your iPhone's screen for the second time and rushed to your nearest Apple Store to have it repaired.  The team at Apple's Genius Bar hands you your phone back within hours - with a hefty bill. But as you proceed to make the payment, there's a new option on the check-out menu: Would you like to add a tip? An unusual request, but it could soon become real. Employees at the first-ever unionised Apple Store in the US are proposing to provide customers with the option to tip for service.The proposal, first reported earlier this week by Bloomberg, has sparked debate about tipping culture in the United States and so-called \"tipping fatigue\". In a series of tweets, the union acknowledged the idea could be \"a little controversial\". \"Apple employees everywhere can tell you that they are already being offered tips by customers,\" the  in suburban Baltimore said.   As it stands, if an Apple employee accepts a tip, he or she could be fired. The new proposal would create a system that allows \"occasional\" customers to reward the team without fear of termination, according to the Union. Making customers feel \"guilt tipped\" when they decline to add a few extra dollars to a purchase, is part of a business model that's emerging around American tipping culture in the wake of the pandemic, say experts.\"It's tipping everything, everywhere, all at once,\" said Thomas Farley, an etiquette expert popularly known as 'Mister Manners'.The Towson, Maryland Apple Store became the first in the country to unionise in 2022.  Apple store employees, and its labour union, The Coalition of Organised Retail Employees (CORE) are currently engaged in contract negotiations with the tech giant and said they expect \"there will be compromises made\".   The tipping scheme proposed would offer customers options ranging from \"no tip, 3%, 5%, custom amount\", the Union said.  Any funds collected through tips would be split among the team members. But on social media, backlash to the proposed tipping scheme was swift, with many noting that tips are generally offered to workers who make low hourly-wages.   Consumers tipped an average 19.6% at full-service restaurants, according to a report from Toast, a point-of-sale service platform.   Etiquette expert Mr Farley said technology is the primary driver behind this \"tipping invasion\". As more companies adopt digital payment systems, like Square and Toast, consumers are often being prompted to add a tip after completing a transaction.   \"My fear is that we're rapidly advancing toward a culture where we're expected to tip for absolutely everything,\" he said.  A survey of  found more than half of Americans said they gave a tip \"when they normally wouldn't\" because they were prompted by the check-out system.    Mr Farley said the rise in demand for tips has become commonplace, in part, because businesses have used the prospect of tips to entice workers in a tight labour market instead of offering higher wages.  Generally, these workers make less than minimum wage and rely on tips to make a living, he said.  \"These are instances where I would absolutely not be miserly, as long as your budget allows,\" he said, but in situation where you know the server is likely making above minimum wage, a tip is discretionary.  \"Just because it's there on a screen doesn't mean you have to, although I know hitting 'no tip' makes you feel like Scrooge,\" he said.  \"That's the idea of a guilt tip.\" Apple store workers vote to form first US unionHow does the world tip?

        "text": "The CBI has hired a team of ethics advisors to help overhaul its operations, following allegations of serious sexual misconduct by staff.The business lobby group's new head Rain Newton-Smith told members on Friday it had taken on the consultancy firm Principia Advisory. The CBI is trying to claw back its reputation following the allegations, which include rape.But it has already suffered an exodus of members.Principia Advisory bills itself as a \"leading advisor on organisational ethics\". Its website suggests that ethical crises should be dealt with using a \"whole systems' approach\" involving accountability by identifying individuals responsible, followed by \"deeper changes\".The allegations at the CBI include claims of harassment and sexual assault including two allegations of rape, one at a summer party held by the group in 2019, another at one of its overseas offices.The City of London Police is currently investigating the rape allegations.The CBI has suspended day-to-day operations pending an extraordinary general meeting scheduled for 6 June, at which it is expected to outline a new strategy.When the first allegations of harassment and sexual assault emerged in early April, the lobby group asked the law firm Fox Williams to investigate.In response to Fox Williams' report, the CBI admitted it had hired \"culturally toxic\" staff and had failed to fire people who sexually harassed female colleagues. That had led a \"very small minority\" of staff to believe they could get away with harassment or violence against women, the group said.An earlier report by the law firm led to the dismissal of Ms Newton-Smith's predecessor, Tony Danker. He was the subject of separate complaints of workplace misconduct, for which he has apologised. The CBI said Ms Newton-Smith had spoken to more than 250 members and former members in an effort to shore up support.But some of its most high profile members have deserted the organisation, including John Lewis and BMW. Others such as Tesco and Sainsbury's have suspended their engagement.The government has also suspended any activity with the lobby group, with Chancellor Jeremy Hunt saying there was \"no point\" engaging with the CBI when its own members had deserted it.Government shuns lobby giant after rape claimBusiness group hired 'toxic' staff and failed to actNew CBI boss: I saw sexual harassment and actedBusiness group CBI is finished, says City bossJohn Lewis quits the CBI after second rape claim"

        "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/business-65478826",
        "text": "HSBC has fought off an attempt by its biggest shareholder to break up the bank during a frequently tense annual general meeting.Chinese insurer Ping An has been trying for more than a year to split the bank.On Friday it failed to gain the backing of any other major shareholder as investors voted to reject the proposal.HSBC chairman Mark Tucker said the result \"draws a line\" under a long-running debate about the bank's structure.Despite being headquartered in London, the large majority of HSBC's profits are made in Asia. Ping An, which holds an 8% stake in HSBC, wants the lender to separate out its Asian business. It argues that the bank's profitable Asia operations are subsidising other parts of the bank that are not performing as strongly. Splitting HSBC would also set it free from the requirements of UK regulators. Ping An and Ken Lui, an individual Hong Kong-based shareholder in HSBC, needed to secure 75% of all votes cast at the AGM to force through the split.They failed to get those numbers, with no other major institutional investor backing the plan. Mr Tucker told the AGM a break-up of the bank would undermine its global strategy, and would be both risky and costly. \"It would not be in shareholders' interests to split the bank,\" he told the AGM in Birmingham, which was frequently interrupted by climate change activists who claim HSBC is not doing enough to reduce its financing of polluting industries and businesses.At the meeting, Mr Lui vowed to fight on with the break-up plan, saying he would keep pressure on HSBC's management and would lobby the bank's many small shareholders in Hong Kong. It is not clear what Ping An's next step will be but there are bigger factors at play beyond making a return on its investment.Ping An is partly owned by the Chinese state and, according to some analysts, could be representing Beijing's political aims as much as its shareholders' financial interests.Hong Kong is by far China's most important financial hub and HSBC is the centrepiece institution.Some argue that to Beijing, the idea of simply leaving the city's most valuable asset in Western hands could be a risk that is too big to take.The example of Russia's economic isolation following the invasion of Ukraine is a case in point.Should a similar geopolitical crisis emerge involving China - not an impossibility given the tensions around Taiwan and the South China Sea - having a grip on one of Asia's top banks will be vital.In this sense, HSBC is dealing with an existential crisis that dates back to its founding in Hong Kong under British rule.For most of its 158-year history, the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation - as it was originally known - has had a long-distance relationship with the UK.In fact, HSBC only became a major UK High Street player in the 1990s, when it bought Midland Bank and moved its headquarters to London in 1993. To this day, HSBC even prints the bank notes in Hong Kong.\"There is a jarring gap between HSBC's centre of gravity in Hong Kong and its subservience to regulators in Britain,\" says Steve Vickers, a corporate risk consultant based in Hong Kong. \"This is an accident of history and a remnant of the colonial era.\"A small taste of this came in 2020, when the Bank of England directed HSBC and other British lenders to stop paying out dividends to shareholders because of the pandemic. This enraged ordinary shareholders in Hong Kong, who own about a third of HSBC's shares and many of whom rely on the payments for their retirement funds. From the Chinese mainland perspective, it was a simple but stark illustration of the power of officials on the other side of the world. Asia may generate the money, but ultimately London calls the shots.This is not a situation either Ping An or China wants to be in. It may explain why Ping An is pushing HSBC so hard and so publicly with the kind of shareholder activism that is normally associated with Western investors.\"A more assertive China is now unafraid to project itself in the international business arena,\" says Steve Vickers. \"But they have to tread very carefully with HSBC - the stakes are high.\"Investors sue over Credit Suisse collapseHSBC \u00a31 deal to buy collapsed bank to boost profitBank on heightened alert for further banking risksHSBC swoops in to rescue UK arm of Silicon Valley Bank"

        "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-63781303",
        "text": "A new global climate pact - the Sharm el-Sheikh Implementation Plan - was agreed at the COP27 summit.It included a historic commitment by richer nations to give money to developing nations to help them recover from the damage and economic losses wreaked from ongoing climate change impacts.This comes after a year of devastating climate change-related disasters, from severe floods in Pakistan to ongoing drought in East Africa.But there was also disappointment expressed by some world leaders that there was no agreement to reduce fossil fuel usage.The plan - although not legally binding - has provided new ambitions for the world's nations on climate change.New moneyFor the first time countries agreed to establish a \"loss and damage\" fund. This will be a pot of money to help poorer nations recover from the impacts of climate change, such as destroyed homes, flooded land or lost income from dried-out crops.Previously, these countries have only received money for mitigation - efforts to move away from fossil fuels, and adaptation. This is money to prepare for the future impacts of climate change.The issue of loss and damage has been highly controversial. Richer nations have previously not wanted to agree to a new fund as they thought it would make them liable to cover all economic losses from climate change.How much countries will get from the fund - and by when - is still to be decided.Fossil fuelsAt last year's summit, COP26, in Glasgow, countries agreed to \"phase down\" coal. At one point during this year's negotiations countries were discussing expanding that to include oil and gas.But . Instead countries committed to \"enhancing a clean energy mix, including low-emission and renewable energy\".But the phrase \"low-emission energy\" has raised concerns.It has not been formally defined, and there is worry that it could open the door to more gas development - as burning gas produces less emissions than other fossil fuels like coal.The UK's independent climate change body,  there had been \"limited progress on ambition to reduce emissions\".And the UK's Alok Sharma, who was COP President in Glasgow, said he was \"pretty disappointed we haven't moved much further than what we got in Glasgow\".A flurry of other announcements was made.Nature and foodFor the first time the main agreement had specific sections on forests and \"nature-based solutions\".These are actions that protect or enhance the environment that also have climate benefits, for example restoring mangroves.By including these new sections, leaders agreed that climate change, and efforts to protect plants and animals, should be complementary and not contradictory.Just weeks after COP27 governments met again in Montreal to agree a \"global goal for nature\".The text also mentioned food for the first time, and recognised how food shortages could continue to be driven by climate change. from the universities of Bournemouth, Exeter and Sheffield, published in October, estimated that 42% of recent food price inflation has been due to climate change. In Egypt countries committed to a four-year programme to discuss solutions to ongoing food issues.Buying less stuffCurrently countries calculate their total emissions and set targets, based on what they produce within their borders such as from producing electricity, or burning fuels.This means they don't count the emissions from the goods and services produced by another country for them. This is despite the fact that developed nations import large amounts of manufactured products. If these \"consumption-based\" emissions were counted then the UK's carbon footprint For the first time in a global climate agreement countries recognised \"the importance of transition[ing] to sustainable patterns of consumption\".It is not yet clear how governments will translate this into local plans or actions.Trading carbonIn 2021 in Glasgow countries agreed to establish a global market for trading carbon.Simply put, this means that countries or companies that produce fewer emissions than their targets could \"sell\" the carbon as a credit to another country or company that has produced too many emissions.Although the basic rules for this market had been agreed before Egypt there were still a lot of unresolved issues.The main one was what could be counted as a carbon credit. For example if a country planted lots of trees which absorb carbon dioxide could they sell this?A smaller group of countries has been working on the issue for the past year and presented their recommendations in Sharm el-Sheikh. But many observers and government's weren't happy.Teresa Anderson, Climate Justice Lead at Action Aid International, told the BBC there was concern that indigenous groups' rights wouldn't be protected: \"You can make a really tenuous claim about your product - that it will remove carbon in some way from the atmosphere, but that could be in the form of tree plantations taking land from communities.\"She added that \"one of the looniest proposals on the table is that you can actually cut down forests to turn into furniture\" - with companies claiming they store carbon.A decision on this issue has now been delayed till COP28 at the end of 2023.Whilst last year's COP in Glasgow was all about target setting, COP27 in Egypt was all about implementation.Six years ago, countries were asked to make changes to keep global warming \"well below\" 2C - and to try to aim for 1.5C.Ahead of the conference 200 countries were asked to submit new plans to cut emissions by 2030, to prevent temperatures rising by more than 1.5C.With these new plans, global temperatures are still expected to rise to 2.4C. So the Egyptian COP President Sameh Shoukry wanted to focus on turning some of the more ambitious targets and pledges into tangible action.Some countries will put the commitments they make at COP into domestic law, but most will have to be self-policed.This means it is difficult to hold countries to account for their promises. Back in 2009 richer nations promised developing countries they would give them $100bn (\u00a388bn) a year by 2020 to help with climate change, that goal was missed and there has been no action.Next year's COP28 summit is in UAE."

        "text": "Climate change could dramatically reduce life in the deepest parts of our oceans that are reached by sunlight, scientists warn.Global warming could curtail life in the so-called twilight zone by as much as 40% by the end of the century, according to new research.The twilight zone lies between 200m (656ft) and 1,000m (3,281ft).It teems with life but was home to fewer organisms during warmer periods of Earth's history, researchers found.In research led by the University of Exeter, scientists looked at two warm periods in Earth's past, about 50 million years ago and 15 million years ago, examining records from preserved microscopic shells. They found far fewer organisms lived in the zone during these periods, because bacteria degraded food more quickly, meaning less of it reached the twilight zone from the surface.\"The rich variety of twilight zone life evolved in the last few million years, when ocean waters had cooled enough to act rather like a fridge, preserving the food for longer, and improving conditions allowing life to thrive,\" said Dr Katherine Crichton, from the University of Exeter, who was the lead author of the study.The twilight zone, also known as the disphotic zone, is a vital habitat for marine life. It is too dim for photosynthesis to occur but home to more fish than the rest of the ocean put together, as well as a wide range of life including microbes, plankton and jellies .It also serves a key environmental function as a carbon sink - drawing planet-heating gas out of our atmosphere.The scientists simulated what might be happening in the twilight zone now, and what could happen in future due to climate warming. They said their findings suggested that significant changes may already be underway.  \"Our study is a first step to finding out how vulnerable this ocean habitat may be to climate warming,\" said Dr Crichton.\"Unless we rapidly reduce greenhouse gas emissions, this could lead to the disappearance or extinction of much twilight zone life within 150 years, with effects spanning millennia thereafter.\"The paper was published in the journal Nature Communications."

        "text": "This video can not be playedWatch the bollard being run over, bent, burned and then stolenYou have probably never felt sympathy for a bollard before, but spare a thought for the one installed on Howard Street in east Oxford last year.It is probably the most abused bollard in the UK.It is blocking the road as part of a Low Traffic Neighbourhood - an LTN - and has been repeatedly run over, beaten, bent, burnt and, finally, stolen.LTN schemes sound innocuous - they attempt to restrict through-traffic in local communities to cut congestion and pollution - but they have provoked fury.As well as bollard abuse, LTNs have sometimes led to confrontations between local residents and - more recently - to mass protests.Over the past few months, councils across England have been lobbied by vocal campaigners against the introduction of new traffic schemes, and some council meetings have been disrupted by activists.  LTNs involve restricting roads in local communities to virtually all through-traffic. They are funded by the government as part of its \u00a33.2bn active travel policy - and the aim is that half of all trips in England's towns and cities be walked, cycled, or made in a wheelchair by 2030.It is part of a push to reduce air pollution, cut greenhouse gas emissions and make us all a bit fitter and healthier.Local authorities bid for government cash to pay for things, such as cycle lanes, big plant pots and bollards to redirect traffic to other roads.Oxford has been a focus of the debate over LTNs in recent years.It got its first permanent LTN in the east of the city two years ago - and a second one is now being trialled.There are also tough restrictions on how traffic moves through the centre of the city - including number plate recognition cameras that issue fines to cars driving on the high street during restricted hours.Oxfordshire County Council says the medieval city can't cope with the level of traffic it has now.But opponents say the city's efforts have ended up slowing traffic on main roads and dividing communities.\"They are setting neighbour against neighbour,\" warns Richard Parnham, an Oxford resident who is campaigning against traffic restrictions in the city with a local pressure group called Reconnecting Oxford.Mr Parnham says the schemes have \"torn the city apart\".There is no shortage of videos online showing angry confrontations over the new traffic schemes.When bollards are stolen some residents have stepped in to block the road themselves, sometimes provoking violent reactions.Theo Hopkins is 79 years old and one of these \"human bollards\".He says he has been hit twice during confrontations with angry drivers. Once a car pushed him off the road.  Prof Rachel Aldred of Westminster University has studied the impact of 46 schemes in London and says motor traffic is down by an average of about 30% on the roads within the boundaries of the LTNs. But many drivers and residents complain that LTNs just push the problem from side roads to main roads.Prof Aldred says the evidence here isn't clear. Recorded traffic goes up on the boundary roads in half the LTNs she has studied - and down in the other half. The average increase in traffic flows on boundary roads is just over 1%. Prof Aldred says if LTNs were systematically pushing traffic on to boundary roads she believes her study would have picked that up.Most LTNs are introduced on a temporary basis subject to consultation with local people, typically after a period of more than a year.   But, in the face of negative feedback, many local authorities have ripped out LTNs - some before the end of the consultation period. Ealing Council in London removed seven of nine LTNs it had introduced, for example. A key issue for residents who opposed the schemes appeared to be the almost \u00a33m of fines the council had collected from drivers who used the LTNs as cut throughs.The Taxpayers' Alliance, a pressure group which campaigns for lower taxes, says there has been a massive increase in fines imposed on motorists by local authorities.It made Freedom of Information requests to 41 councils in England and Scotland - 37 responded. It found the value of fines issued inside LTNs had increased from \u00a3700,000 in the year 2019-20, to almost \u00a370m in 2021-22.\"We're not against schemes to improve the air quality in our cities,\" says Elliot Keck of the Alliance. \"What we are against is schemes being used as cash cows.\"The Local Government Association, a cross-party body representing local authorities in England and Wales, says the cash raised covers the cost of enforcement with any surplus \"being spent on local transport improvements\".But the opposition to the introduction of traffic restrictions has been becoming increasingly vocal.Thousands of protesters marched in Oxford in February after the council announced plans for new restrictions on traffic through the centre of the city.There was a flurry of claims on social media that the restrictions are evidence of a sinister global plot to limit our freedom to travel.Since then, there have been protests in Cambridge, Bath and Thetford - while in Colchester, a council meeting to discuss proposals for more sustainable transport was disrupted by noisy protestors. Justin Rowlatt travels to Oxford for Panorama, to see how the introduction of Low Traffic Neighbourhoods (LTNs) has led to vandalism and angry confrontations. Watch  - also on BBC One at 20:00 on Monday 17 April (20:30 in Wales)The actor-turned-activist Laurence Fox, who in recent years became known for his opposition to the Covid lockdowns, attended the protest in Oxford.He told the BBC he was worried about what he called \"a government desire to control our movement, speech, everything\".\"We should be seeking more freedom, not less,\" says Mr Fox. Zuhura Plummer, an Oxford resident who has campaigned in favour of the city's LTNs as part of a group called Oxfordshire Liveable Streets, sees things very differently.\"What about the freedom to be able to cycle down the street without getting knocked off your bike?

        "text": "Some of the UK's biggest pension funds have voted against reappointing BP's chairman over a decision to weaken its climate plans, but the majority of shareholders backed Helge Lund. It comes after the energy giant cut back its target to reduce emissions by the end of the decade.As well as the dissenting votes there were also disruptions during the annual meeting from climate protestors.BP said it valued \"constructive challenge and engagement\".The original target to reduce emissions was agreed by shareholders in 2022 and included a promise to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 35% to 40% by the end of this decade.But in February, BP announced it was now aiming for a 20% to 30% cut so it could produce more oil and gas and extend the life of existing fossil fuel projects.BP chief executive Bernard Looney said this was in response to increased concerns about energy security following the invasion of Ukraine.The five pension funds told the BBC that their vote against the company's chairman, Helge Lund, was a protest against the company's actions.The pension funds have \u00a3440m invested in BP, which represents less than 1% of the company's total shares. But they manage the pensions of more than a third of the UK's workers so are an influential voice.Mr Lund received a majority of more than 90% for re-election during the annual meeting on Thursday. Katharina Lindmeier, senior responsible investment manager at Nest, the government-backed pension fund, told the BBC: \"Not only were we disappointed to see the company going back on the targets, but we were also really surprised not to have had any consultation.\"The five pension funds - Nest, the Universities Pension Scheme, LGPS Central, Brunel Pension Partnership and Border to Coast -  are concerned that the new targets put BP financially at risk because the company's fossil fuel projects are likely to lose value as the world moves towards net zero emissions.Nest also told the BBC that there were concerns over BP's actions on reducing gas flaring, after seeing the BBC documentary The BBC News investigation showed that BP was one of several major oil companies  at oil fields in Iraq, which produces cancer-linked pollutants.Ali Hussein Julood, who documented his life in Rumaila, Iraq for the documentary, suspected his childhood leukaemia was due to the flaring. He passed away on 21 April after his cancer returned. Ali's father told the board of his son's passing during the AGM, and how despite their efforts, there was still black smoke and gas flaring outside his front door. Mr Looney gave his condolences at the meeting to Ali's family and said: \"We are continuing to reduce flaring at Rumaila. We are making progress and it must continue to be made\".The pension funds told the BBC they only found out about the change in BP's climate targets via media reports. They then approached BP to ask for a vote on the new targets but BP refused, arguing it was not a material change to the strategy. Patrick O'Hara, director of responsible investment at LGPS Central, told the BBC: \"If you change the strategy you should really enter into a dialogue with those that supported you.\"He said he thought BP's decision was driven by short-term profit considerations rather than the long term sustainability of the company. \"Are these strategies science-based if you can flex them based on what the oil and gas price is? We are long-term investors and we expect the company to take a long-term view\", he said. The company's profits more than doubled to $27.7bn (\u00a323bn) in 2022, as energy prices soared after Russia invaded Ukraine.As well as protest voting, there were half a dozen green activists removed from BP's annual meeting of its board and shareholders on Thursday, as they demanded the company \"stop drilling\" for fossil fuels.The Dutch environmental organisation Follow This also put forward a resolution - supported by the five pension funds - which calls for more aggressive targets on what are known as scope 3 emissions - emissions from the use of its products.BP recommended that shareholders not support this resolution calling it \"unclear\", \"simplistic\" and \"disruptive\".ISS and Glass Lewis are the world's largest investor services and recommended to BP shareholders they advise to oppose the climate resolution.Courteney Keatinge, senior director for ESG research at Glass Lewis, said the company does not see BP's actions to reduce its climate targets as a financial risk because the world will continue to use oil and gas past 2050.\"We are not operating under a net zero 2050 scenario, the demand is going to be there [in 2050], people will be flying planes and heating their homes\", she said. The resolution only garnered 16.75% of the vote but that was up on 14.9% the same resolution received last year.Under Poisoned SkiesThe deadly impact of the oil giants' toxic air pollution on children and the planet is revealed in this BBC News Arabic investigation from the front line of climate change in Iraq.The documentary is available  and .BP scales back climate targets as profits hit recordUndercover in the world\u2019s dirtiest oil field"

        "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-65403381",
        "text": "Spain recorded its hottest ever temperature for April on Thursday, hitting 38.8C according to the country's meteorological service.The record figure was reached in Cordoba airport in southern Spain just after 15:00 local time (14:00 BST).For days a blistering heatwave has hit the country with temperatures 10-15C warmer than expected for April. It's been driven by a mass of very hot air from Africa, coupled with a slow moving weather system.\"This is not normal. Temperatures are completely out of control this year,\" Cayetano Torres, a spokesman for Spain's meteorological office, told BBC News.Experts were surprised by the scale of the heat experienced across southern Spain in recent days.\"This heat event in Spain is absolutely extreme, unprecedented with temperatures never seen before in April. In some locations records are being beaten by a 5C margin, which is something that has happened only a handful of times at weather stations around the world,\" said Maximiliano Herrera, a climatologist who runs an  twitter account.This video can not be playedWatch: Why is it so hot in Spain this week?Schools will be allowed to adapt their timetables to avoid the worst of the heat. The Madrid underground has trains passing more frequently than usual in order to prevent long waits on the platform, and public swimming pools are expected to open a month earlier than normal.Cristina Linares, a scientist at the Carlos III Health Institute, warned in particular of the impact on the poor. \"Poverty is the key factor when it comes to explaining why there are more deaths associated with extreme temperatures. Income is the factor with the closest link to the impact of heat on day-to-day deaths.\" Heatwaves are also striking many locations globally as climate change exacerbates naturally high temperatures.  While parts of Britain are cooler than average right now, the opposite is the case in many regions of Spain. Meteorologists say that a combination of factors is responsible for the exceptional temperatures being seen there this week.Hot weather across North Africa is pushing heat into Europe. A high pressure weather system plus clear skies over the Iberian peninsula are allowing more sunshine to hit the ground, which is already so dry it can't evaporate the heat.The high temperatures come on top of long running drought in many parts of Spain. Reservoirs in the Guadalquivir basin are only at 25% of capacity. This combination is raising the prospect of early forest fires, with the national weather service warning that large swathes of the country would be at risk.  Spain saw the most land burned of any country in Europe in 2022.Climate change is very likely playing a role in this heatwave, according to experts in the field.\"We know that 2022 was the second warmest year on record for Europe, and it was the warmest summer on record,\" Dr Samantha Burgess from the Copernicus climate change service told BBC News.  \"Europe is warming at twice the global rate and we know because there is a higher rate of warming, there's a higher probability of extreme events. And those extreme events include heat waves.\"As well as the impact on young and old, another concern is agriculture. Many farmers are experiencing difficulties due to the ongoing lack of rain, with the government in Madrid asking the European Union for financial help.Some landowners say they won't plant crops due to the dry conditions, which could have implications for food supplies across Europe. This heatwave in Spain is not an isolated event - all across the world high temperatures in the first few months of this year have shattered records.Eight countries in central and eastern Europe set new all time highs for the warmest January weather on the very first day of this year.Countries across Asia have seen extreme heat in recent weeks. In northwest Thailand, the temperature hit 45.4C on 15 April, while in Laos it reached 42.7C.In Bangladesh, the capital Dhaka saw the mercury rise above 40C, believed to be the hottest day in 58 years. Another factor likely to influence weather across the world over the coming months is the likely onset of an El Ni\u00f1o event. This will see more heat emerge in the Pacific ocean off the coast of Peru.  If it happens, then 2024 might emerge as the world's warmest year on record, with more storms, fires and floods. \"It seems we are living in a world of a new normal here,\" said Dr Fahad Saeed, from research organisation, Climate Analytics.\"These people in regions like Asia are the people who have been adapting to these kinds of extreme temperatures for thousands of years, but its is now getting beyond their ability to adapt.\"\"That's why we are witnessing rising death rates due to heat each year in this part of the world.\""

        "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/world-australia-62489056",
        "text": "In 2008, the Brown family watched on helplessly as destructive bushfires ripped through the Victorian countryside. For them, it was a wakeup call.It was the third time in several years flames had come close to torching vineyards that five generations of their family had poured over a century of love and work into.Warming days, declining rainfall and subsequent drought had snuck up on them, but this was a glaring warning sign they couldn't ignore.Climate change had become the family businesses' \"biggest threat\", Caroline Brown says.It's not a problem unique to the Browns - the family behind one of the oldest wine brands in Australia. The country is the world's fifth-largest wine exporter and is home to a diverse array of wine regions most other countries could only dream of.And while climate change is threatening winemakers worldwide, Australia's industry is on the front lines.Ashley Ratcliff's vineyards are already in one of the hottest and driest wine regions on the planet.There was one year, he recalls, when their vineyards in South Australia's Riverland region got only 90mm of rain - 10 times less than the annual average for the famous French wine region of Bordeaux.\"It was hot, everything was dirty and dusty,\" he says. \"And then on the other extreme, you get the really wet years where you never think it's going to dry out.\"And it will only get worse.In the next 20 years, the Riverland will be about 1.3 degrees hotter and rainfall will drop, according to modelling by Australian researchers.With that will also come more extreme weather events, which are already a near constant in Australia.The country is still recovering from years of record-breaking floods, but with an El Nino summer likely to bring dry and hot conditions to much of Australia, panic is growing ahead of the coming fire season.While grapevines are described as \"one of the most valuable weeds in the world\", capable of growing almost anywhere, the fruit itself is vulnerable to its environment.And climate change is already messing with flavour and quality. Heat affects the speed at which the grapes ripen and with it, their sugar and acidity levels.Already the growing season has shifted forward - by weeks in some places - which also impacts logistics and infrastructure.Then there's the impact of weather events driven by climate change, which at their worst can wipe out an entire season's crop.All of this means growing certain types of wine grapes in Australia - those suited to cooler climates like Sauvignon Blanc, Chardonnay and Pinot Noir - will only get harder.The Ratcliffs strategically decided to plant \"alternative\" varieties more suited to warmer climes when they purchased their vineyards in 2003.They deemed the risk posed by climate change as greater than that of selling lesser-known grapes. Two decades on, anyone not contemplating doing the same is kidding themselves, Mr Ratcliff says. \"There are all those fervent doomsday people. [But] I think there is an opportunity to rebrand and make the industry really exciting - to use climate change as a positive rather than a negative.\"The average consumer won't notice a big difference between the wines they love and the up-and-coming alternative varieties that Ricca Terra sells - like Montepulciano, Fiano and Nero D'Avola. The grapes are hardier and often more planet-friendly too, requiring less water.The Brown family too is growing alternative varieties, including some they created with Australia's science agency. But they have also looked south to keep current favourites alive. With climate change in mind, they began snapping up vineyards in cooler locations like Tasmania - a growing trend across the industry.\"We realised that having all of our vineyards in one location in Victoria meant we had all our eggs in one basket,\" Ms Brown says.But Tahbilk Winery's Hayley Purbrick is one grower who is staying put, despite \"confronting\" climate modelling.\"We have a philosophy that our responsibility is to create a climate where grapes can grow,\" she says. \"There's so much you can do at a local level and sometimes when we think [about climate change on a global scale] we get a bit too wrapped up in the impossibility of what we can't do.\"Her family's vineyards in the Goulburn Valley incorporate as much shade and as many \"natural coolants\" as possible. They're planted on the edge of wetlands and are surrounded by 160 hectares of trees.They've also slashed their carbon emissions to net zero, through things like solar power, using heat reflective paint to limit the need for air conditioning, and reducing waste.It's working so far: \"We're lucky in the sense that we're three degrees cooler than places even three kilometres away.\"But researcher Tom Remenyi says adaptation and mitigation can only take growers so far.On the current trajectory, the whole of Australia is going to get warmer and dryer - and while a couple of degrees might not sound like a lot, it could be catastrophic, he says.\"A three-degree shift of the average increases the frequency of extremely hot days by about tenfold, if not more. If the whole globe warms more than three degrees, it's highly likely that we will not be worried about growing wine.\"And that's exactly what is weighing on growers like Caroline Brown. For her, the family business is inextricably entwined with the family history.She spent her childhood getting into mischief with her cousins among the vineyards at Milawa. Now they all work in the business.She desperately wants the same for the next generations.\"We're very passionate about family,\" she says. \"Our great-grandfather started the business\u2026 we'd love one day for our great-grandchildren to be in the lucky positions we're in.\"But she is well aware that climate change threatens that.\"If we don't look after where we're growing grapes then we're not going to have any way to plant them in the future. So it is scary,\" she says. But there will be very few - if any - of the country's favourite varieties it won't be able to grow somewhere, she argues.\"You'll always be able to grow Cabernet in Australia, but it just might not taste as good in the years to come.\"Brits snap up Australian wine not going to China"

She said that women understand \"what it means to live in community\", and therefore what it means to care for others and the natural world.Shirley told the BBC that indigenous women in particular have always fought for environmental protection and \"need to be respected and people need to listen to us\". Last week world leaders gathered at the COP27 summit and took the inaugural 'family photo'. There were 110 leaders present, but just 7 were women.This is one of the lowest concentrations of women seen at these UN climate summits - known as COPs, , which tracks female participation at such events.The male skew among leaders reflected a broader trend across the delegation teams that countries have sent. Analysis by the BBC of the participant list found that less than 34% of country negotiation staff were female. Some teams were more than 90% male.These delegation teams participate in negotiations at the conference on key climate issues such as funding and limiting use of fossil fuels.In 2011 countries pledged to increase female participation at these talks, but the share this year has fallen since a peak of 40% in 2018, Dr Jeanne d'Arc Mujawamariya, environment minister for Rwanda - which has 52% women in its cabinet - told the BBC the outcomes of the negotiations will be affected by the lack of women participating.This was a sentiment echoed by Rep. Kathy Castor, chair of the US Select Committee on the Climate Crisis. She told the BBC at COP27 that women's presence was vital. \"It is absolutely fundamental to climate action that we educate young women and girls, but that means they must have a seat at the table at international conferences,\" she said.On Monday,  by charity ActionAid revealed that women and girls are facing increased and specific risks as the climate crisis worsens. The report reveals that in many developing nations - which are facing the worst impacts of climate change - women have greater responsibility for securing water, food and fuel for their families, which can be more difficult during floods, drought or other climate-related crises. The majority of agricultural workers are also women, so when there is severe drought, as seen currently in East Africa, their income can be drastically cut. The UN has estimated that  are women.Dr Sila Monthe is an International Rescue Committee health manager currently working in Kakuma Refugee Camp in Kenya. She told the BBC that she has seen increased nutrient deficiencies in women and young girls in the drought-affected area \"as they often eat last, and worst\". There are also concerns that as women go further afield to collect food and water they are exposed to increased risks of violence. Sophie Rigg, senior climate advisor at ActionAid, told the BBC that climate change is exacerbating gender inequalities and the solutions being discussed at COP27 must be tailored to the specific issues being faced by women. And young women are currently leading the charge on taking climate action,  Some of the most famous legal cases brought against governments for inaction on climate change, have been brought by women. Global director for gender at the World Bank, Hana Brixi, said there is increasing evidence that having women participating improves the outcomes in global negotiations like COP27.Ms Rigg from ActionAid UK agrees: \"There is no getting around when women are in the room they create solutions that are proven to be more sustainable.\" Because of this Ms Brixi said that she is seeing progress in female participation as organisations and governments wake up to the impact they can have.BBC analysis of the country teams at COP27 in Egypt shows that European, North American and island states are more likely to have balanced teams, whilst African and Middle Eastern countries are more likely to skew male.Ms Castor, from the US delegation, said that her country's negotiators have raised the issue of female participation with this years' hosts in Egypt and will be doing so with other countries."

        "text": "This video can not be playedWatch: England's local elections...in under 60 secondsHeavy Conservative local election losses represent a \"clear rejection\" of Rishi Sunak in his first electoral test as prime minister, Labour has said. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer claimed his party was on course to win the next general election, expected next year.The Tories lost 48 councils and more than 1,000 councillors across England in Thursday's polls, exceeding their worst predictions.Many Tories were angry at the scale of the losses, with .Labour says it is now the largest party in local government, surpassing the Tories for the first time since 2002.\"The British public has sent a clear rejection of a prime minister who never had a mandate to begin with,\" a Labour spokesperson said.The Liberal Democrats had what their leader Sir Ed Davey said was their \"best result in decades\", , mostly in Tory heartlands. The party gained 405 new councillors, compared with Labour's 536 gains. - their best-ever result in local elections - and gained its first majority on an English council, in Mid-Suffolk, although they were overtaken as the biggest party by Labour in Brighton and Hove.Mr Sunak admitted the results were \"disappointing\", but said he did not detect \"a massive groundswell of movement towards the Labour Party or excitement for its agenda\". Sir Keir claimed the \"fantastic\" results showed his party was well placed to oust the Tories from government in a general election, expected next year.\"Make no mistake, we are on course for a Labour majority at the next general election,\" he told cheering activists in Medway in Kent, one of the councils his party has wrested from the Tories.Labour won control of councils in areas that will be crucial battlegrounds in the general election, including Medway, Swindon, Plymouth, Stoke-on-Trent, and East Staffordshire.The BBC's projected national vote share put Labour on 35%, the Tories on 26% and the Lib Dems on 20%.Labour's projected nine-point lead represents its largest over the Conservatives on this measure since the party lost power in 2010.Sir John Curtice, the polling expert, said this year's results were \"only a little short of calamitous for the Conservatives\".But the BBC's political editor, Chris Mason, said the results suggested it would be hard for either the Conservatives or Labour to be confident of winning a majority at the next general election.Labour shadow cabinet member Peter Kyle denied the results, which saw the Lib Dems gain nearly as many new councillors as Labour, was an anti-government, rather than a pro-Labour, vote.He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the results showed Labour had won back support in \"key places\" and would win an outright majority at the general election, without needing to do deals with other parties.\"In all of the areas that the Labour Party targeted, that we focused resources, that we really wanted to reconnect to voters, we did so.\"He added that Sir Keir Starmer had \"led from the front\" and Labour had run a \"disciplined\" campaign, which showed it was \"moving towards government.\"In Swindon, where Labour took control of the borough council for the first time in 20 years, ousted Tory council leader David Renard blamed \"the cost of living and the performance of the government in the last 12 months\" for his party's woes locally.Mr Renard said although the prime minister had \"started to stabilise things\", for voters in Swindon \"what had gone on before that was something that they didn't like\".The Conservative mayor of the Tees Valley, Ben Houchen, who is up for election next year, said the poor Tory performance was a partly a result of \"the turmoil and upheaval of the last 12 months\".He said Labour had been \"successful in making this a referendum on the government\", adding \"people don't feel like they can vote for us\".Nigel Churchill, a former Tory councillor who lost his seat on Plymouth Council - another Labour target - said \"I think we can safely say\" the Conservatives will lose the next general election.\"The general public do not trust them at the moment,\" he said.But Education Minister Robert Halfon said this year's local elections were always \"going to be difficult\" for his party.He said internal party divisions \"didn't help\", but claimed the losses were down to external factors, such as the cost-of-living crisis and problems in the NHS.\"Every government during the mid-term, especially a government that has been in power for 13 years, always suffers losses in local elections,\" he said.Other Tory MPs told the BBC that apathy - Conservative voters staying at home - was also a big problem for the party.The seats up for grabs were mostly on district councils, responsible for services including bin collections, parks, public housing and planning applications.The rest of the elections were for a mixture of metropolitan and unitary councils - single local authorities that deal with all local services - and for four mayors.The elections were the first in England to see voter ID checks at polling stations. Some voters told the BBC they were turned away from polling stations, prompting critics to call for the ID rules to be dropped.Starmer visits Medway after Labour wins councilLib Dems make gains in traditionally Tory areasBest ever local election results for Greens"

Matt Turnbull, one of those arrested, said the straps holding the placards had been \"misconstrued\" as something that could be used for locking on.\"To be honest we were never going to be allowed to be a visible force here - they knew we were coming, and they were going to find a way to stop this,\" he told the BBC.The BBC later saw Mr Turnbull being led away in handcuffs.

        "text": "This video can not be playedWatch: US releases footage from its drone of the encounter with a Russian jetThe US military has released footage of a Russian jet crashing into one of its drones over the Black Sea.The US said the damage to the large drone meant it had to be brought down into the water near Crimea on Tuesday.Russia denied its Su-27 fighter jet clipped the propeller of the drone, but the video appears to back up the American version of events.It was in the Pentagon's interest to release this video - not least to verify its version of events.The BBC has not seen the events before or after the collision. The US initially said the confrontation lasted around 30-40 minutes, but the released footage lasts for less than a minute. On Wednesday night, US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin said: \"We remain confident in the facts we've conveyed so far.\" He said then the Pentagon was looking at what video could be released. It is not unusual for militaries to take some time to declassify video footage before making it public. Mr Austin previously described Russia's actions as  - and the edited video released appears to back that up. A feed from a camera fitted under the fuselage of the surveillance drone shows a Russian Su-27 making two extremely close passes while releasing what appears to be fuel as it approaches.  In the first pass it seems to mire the lens of the camera. The second pass is even closer - disrupting the video feed from the remotely piloted aircraft.When the picture returns, a blade of the drone's propeller at the back of the aircraft can be seen bent out of shape. National Security Council spokesman John Kirby told the BBC's US broadcast partner CBS that it was not clear whether the Russian action was deliberate or accidental.But he said this did not matter because the moves were \"completely inappropriate, unsafe and unprofessional\".Surveillance flights would continue over the Black Sea, he said, but there was no need for military escorts, which he said were unnecessary and would put pilots at risk.Russia has claimed the drone was approaching its territory, but all we can see from the video is sea, sky and cloud. Moscow appeared to suggest on Tuesday that it had imposed a unilateral no-fly zone over the region as part of its invasion of Ukraine. Russian Ambassador to the US Anatoly Antonov said the drone had \"violated boundaries of the temporary airspace regime established for the special military operation\". But Mr Kirby said the airspace was international and not restricted.In a statement released hours after the crash, the US said Russian jets dumped fuel on the drone several times before the collision. Pentagon spokesman Brig Gen Pat Ryder told reporters the drone was \"unflyable and uncontrollable\", adding the collision also likely damaged the Russian aircraft.Russia's defence ministry said the drone crashed after a \"sharp manoeuvre\", and that it was flying with its transponders (communication devices) turned off.The Kremlin has not yet responded to the release of the US video. On Wednesday Russia's security council secretary  the remnants of the drone.On Thursday, Russian ships were seen at the site of the downed drone on the Black Sea, US media reported.Mr Kirby said the US was also searching for the aircraft, but stressed that if Russia beat them to it, \"their ability to exploit useful intelligence will be highly minimised\".That message was reiterated by General Mark Milley, America's top military general, who said the US has taken \"mitigating measures\" to ensure there was nothing of value on the downed drone.A moment fraught with dangerPentagon calls Russia's move 'unprofessional'Russia pilots reckless in drone collision - US"

        "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-65173043",
        "text": "This video can not be playedWatch: The moment Finland hands over Nato documentsFinland has become the 31st member of the Nato security alliance, doubling the length of member states' borders with Russia.The Finnish foreign minister handed the accession document to the US secretary of state who declared Finland a member.Then in bright sunshine in front of Nato's gleaming new headquarters, Finland's white-and-blue flag joined a circle of 30 other flags.Finland's accession is a setback for Russia's Vladimir Putin. He had repeatedly complained of Nato's expansion before his full-scale invasion of Ukraine.US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said by attacking his neighbour, the Russian leader had triggered exactly what he had sought to prevent.Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov warned that Russia would be \"watching closely\" what happens in Finland, describing Nato's enlargement as a \"violation of our security and our national interests\".A military band played Finland's national anthem followed by the Nato hymn. Beyond the perimeter fence a small group of protesters waving Ukrainian flags chanted \"Ukraine in Nato\", a reminder of why non-aligned Finland had asked to join along with Sweden in May 2022.Finland shares a 1,340-km (832-mile) eastern frontier with Russia and after the war in Ukraine began Helsinki chose the protection of Nato's Article Five, which says an attack on one member is an attack on all.In effect, it means if Finland were invaded or attacked, all Nato members - including the US - would come to its aid.Russia's invasion prompted a surge in Finnish public opinion towards joining Nato to 80% in favour.\"It is a great day for Finland,\" said Finnish President Sauli Niinisto,  Finland would be a reliable ally and its membership would not be a threat to anyone, he said. \"Security and stability are those elements which we feel very strongly; if people can live in secure stable circumstances that's the basic element of happy life.\"\"This will make Finland safer and Nato stronger,\" said Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg earlier, describing it as a proud day for him and the alliance.\"President Putin had a declared goal of the invasion of Ukraine to get less Nato along its borders and no more membership in Europe, he's getting exactly the opposite.\"US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said he was \"tempted to say this is maybe the one thing we can thank Mr Putin for, because he once again here has precipitated something he claims to want to prevent by Russia's aggression\".Finland brings with it a well-equipped and trained, active armed force of about 30,000 with a wartime strength of 280,000. It also provides a challenge for Nato to help keep its long border with Russia secure, but it is already being included in Nato's latest defence plans to keep the alliance secure.Sweden's application has for now become stuck, with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan accusing Stockholm of embracing Kurdish militants and allowing them to demonstrate on the streets. Hungary is also yet to approve Sweden joining.As he handed over the accession document to Mr Blinken, Finnish Foreign Minister Pekka Haavisto said he had a very important initial task: \"The task is to give to you for the deposit also our ratification for Swedish membership.\"Mr Stoltenberg said the most important thing was that Sweden joined as soon as possible and the Finnish president said he looked forward to welcoming his Nordic neighbour at Nato's next summit in Lithuania in July.Helsinki's journey to accession has lasted less than a year, and Tuesday's ceremony coincides with the 74th anniversary of Nato's founding in 1949.\"Finland's a terrific ally, very capable, shares our values and we expect a seamless transition into its proper seat at the table,\" US ambassador to Nato Julianne Smith told the BBC. The Kremlin said that Russia was being forced to take counter-measures to ensure its own security, tactically and strategically, but pointed out it had never had disagreements with Helsinki in the way that Ukraine had become \"anti-Russian\".Meanwhile, Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu said on Tuesday that Russia's short-range Iskander-M ballistic missile system had been handed over to Belarus and was capable of carrying nuclear as well as conventional weapons. Some Belarusian fighter jets were also capable of carrying nuclear weapons, he said.Jens Stoltenberg said Nato had not yet seen any changes to Russia's nuclear posture that would require any change by the alliance. He added there would be no Nato troops stationed in Finland without the consent of the government in Helsinki.Nato will now have seven members on the Baltic Sea, further isolating Russia's coastal access to St Petersburg and its small exclave of Kaliningrad.Mr Peskov told the BBC that Russia would be watching closely how Nato used Finnish territory \"in terms of basing weapons systems and infrastructure there which will be right up close to our borders, potentially threatening us\".\"Based on that, measures will be taken,\" the Kremlin spokesman said.What is Nato and why is Finland joining?Turkey's Erdogan seals deal on Finland joining NatoWho are the Nordic 'terrorists' wanted by Turkey?"

        "text": "The war with Ukraine has split Russia's artistic community. Those who support it have enjoyed government backing, but those who oppose it have come under huge pressure to toe the line.Speaking out comes at a price in Russia. , and if you are a person of culture, you can also be frozen out of key platforms and venues.Andrei Makarevich is one of the best-known performers to fall from favour after criticising government policies in Vladimir Putin's Russia. He rose to prominence during the Soviet era as the frontman of a rock group called Mashina Vremeni (Time Machine). State TV once called him \"a Beatle of Perestroika\", referring to Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev's wide-ranging programme of reforms. But over time Makarevich grew increasingly critical of President Putin. After Russia's initial invasion of Ukraine in 2014, Makarevich wrote a song titled My Country Has Gone Mad and attended anti-war rallies. After this, a string of his concerts across Russia were cancelled, and Makarevich accused the Kremlin of orchestrating a campaign of persecution. After the start of the full-scale war in February 2022, Makarevich left Russia a deeply disillusioned man. \"People have turned out to be much easier to manipulate. More ignorant and aggressive,\" he said in an interview.Nikolai Rastorguyev, on the other hand, is an example of a performer favoured by the state. He is the lead singer of Lyube, which is often described as \"Putin's favourite band\". He is a vocal supporter of the Kremlin's policies including the \"special military operation\" in Ukraine.Unlike Makarevich, Rastorguyev appears to have enjoyed easy access to Russia's best venues for years. On 15 March 2014, the day Makarevich was nearly assaulted by anti-Ukraine activists following a peace march in Moscow, Lyube celebrated its 25th anniversary at the capital's Olympic Stadium.The following day, his band performed in Crimea in support of a vote that had no international recognition but was used by the Kremlin to justify its annexation of the Ukrainian region. Rastorguyev and his band have played at Kremlin-organised mass rallies held at Russia's largest stadium, Luzhniki, and attended by President Putin. It has also authored a song celebrating a bridge linking annexed Crimea to Russia.In a sign of the band's influence, police searching for political subversives have even forced patrons at a bar in Moscow to sing a Lyube song, as proof that they support the government. Nikolai Rastorguyev is subject to EU sanctions imposed for their role in \"the Kremlin's disinformation and information manipulation ecosystem\".In Russia, numerous performers critical of the Kremlin, such as Makarevich, have been officially designated as \"foreign agents\". Divisions run deep among stars of film and theatre, too.Nikita Mikhalkov is one of Russia's most celebrated actors and film directors. One of the pinnacles of his career is Oscar-winning drama Burnt By The Sun (1994), which he both directed and starred in. The film is about lives wrecked by terror in the USSR under Soviet leader Stalin.Mikhalkov's views are also very close to the Kremlin's official ideology: he is a religious conservative, and he espouses extreme anti-Western views.He shares these conspiracy theories in his TV show  (Exorcist), which is aired on state television and is said to number President Putin among its viewers. Mikhalkov is an ardent supporter of Vladimir Putin. In 2007, he co-authored an open letter calling on the Russian president to seek a third presidential term in violation of the constitution. The same year, Mikhalkov made a film celebrating Putin's 55th birthday, which was shown on the day by state TV.The film director has headed Russia's Union of Film-Makers since 1997, and he has received numerous awards and funding from the state, including the Defence Ministry's award for \"developing the Fatherland's culture and art\", and $2m in state funding for a sequel to Burnt By The Sun.He has supported Russia's war on Ukraine in 2022, parroting the president's rhetoric that Ukraine is ruled by a \"Nazi regime\" and that the very Ukrainian language is a manifestation of hatred towards Russia. Months after the invasion started, Vladimir Putin awarded Mikhalkov the title of a \"Hero of Labour\" at a ceremony in the Kremlin. Thanking the president, the film-maker referred to the fighting in Ukraine and said that \"a new Russia\" was being forged there.For his role in spreading \"Kremlin propaganda narratives\", Mikhalkov has been sanctioned by the EU.Actress Liya Akhedzhakova holds very different political views, and her career has followed a different trajectory. She rose to fame in the 1970s thanks to roles in hugely popular Soviet films such as The Irony of Fate and Office Romance, as well as numerous performances at Sovremennik, one of Moscow's best theatres.Since the break-up of the USSR, the diminutive actress has never shied away from making her political views public, and has often been harshly critical of government policies.At a rally in Moscow in 2014, she praised the so-called Euromaidan - protests in Kyiv that led to the toppling of pro-Russian President Viktor Yanukovych and Russia's initial invasion of Ukraine.There was applause and chants of support as Akhedzhakova urged the crowd to honour the pro-democracy demonstrators killed in the Ukrainian capital.By the time President Putin had launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine eight years later, rallies like this were unimaginable in Russia. Speaking on the day of the invasion to independent Dozhd TV, Akhedzhakova urged fellow performers and celebrities to oppose it. \"I'm calling on all people of culture - the time has come to speak out. We have to speak out. We won't get another chance. A war is going on, and there are so many lies, a whole sea of lies,\" she said.Less than a week later, Dozhd was forced to relocate abroad due to tightening censorship and concerns for the welfare of its staff. A year later, Akhedzhakova lost her last role at Sovremennik after 45 years of working at the theatre. According to the actress, the theatre's newly appointed director told her it had been \"inundated\" with letters criticising her - a practice reminiscent of state-orchestrated persecution campaigns in the Soviet Union.In another echo of Stalinism, a pro-government activist recently asked prosecutors to check if the actress was guilty of treason.Jail, poison or exile?

        "text": "More than 20,000 Russian soldiers have been killed in fighting in Ukraine since December, the US estimates.A further 80,000 have been wounded, National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said, citing newly declassified intelligence.Half of the dead are from the Wagner mercenary company, who have been attacking the eastern Bakhmut city. Russia has been trying to take the small city since last year in a grinding war of attrition.Moscow currently holds most of Bakhmut, but Ukrainian troops still control a small portion of the city in the west. The fierce battle has taken on huge symbolic importance for both sides. Ukrainian officials have also said they are using the battle to kill as many of Russia's troops as possible and wear down its reserves.\"Russia's attempt at an offensive in the Donbas [region] largely through Bakhmut has failed,\" Mr Kirby told reporters. \"Russia has been unable to seize any real strategic and significant territory.\"We estimate that Russia has suffered more than 100,000 casualties, including over 20,000 killed in action,\" he added.The toll in Bakhmut accounts for losses since the start of December, according to the US figures.\"The bottom line is that Russia's attempted offensive has backfired after months of fighting and extraordinary losses,\" Mr Kirby said.He added he was not giving estimates of Ukrainian casualties because \"they are the victims here. Russia is the aggressor\".The BBC is unable to independently verify the figures given and Moscow has not commented.The capture of the city would bring Russia slightly closer to its goal of controlling the whole of Donetsk region, one of four regions in eastern and southern Ukraine annexed by Russia last September following referendums widely condemned outside Russia as a sham.Analysts say Bakhmut has little strategic value, but has become a focal point for Russian commanders, who have struggled to deliver any positive news to the Kremlin.The Wagner mercenary group - which widely uses convicts and has become notorious for its often inhumane methods - has taken centre stage in the Russian assault on Bakhmut. Its leader, Yevgeny Prigozhin, has staked his reputation, and that of his private army, on seizing the city. But he recently threatened to pull his troops out of Bakhmut.In a rare in-depth interview to a prominent Russian war blogger, he vowed to withdraw Wagner fighters if they were not provided with much-needed ammunition by the Russian defence ministry.Wagner fighters could be redeployed to Mali, he warned.He has often clashed with Russia's defence ministry during the war, accusing officials of not providing his fighters with enough support. Mr Prigozhin also called upon the Russian media and military leadership to \"stop lying to the Russian population\" ahead of an expected Ukrainian spring counteroffensive.\"We need to stop lying to the Russian population, telling them everything is all right,\" he said.He praised the Ukrainian military's \"good, correct military operations\" and command.A top Ukrainian general said on Monday that counterattacks had ousted Russian forces from some positions in Bakhmut, but the situation remained \"difficult\".New Russian units, including paratroopers and fighters from Wagner, are being \"constantly thrown into battle\" despite taking heavy losses, Gen Oleksandr Syrskyi, the commander of Ukraine's ground forces, said on Telegram. \"But the enemy is unable to take control of the city,\" he said.Killed holding off waves of Russians in BakhmutWhat the leaked Pentagon files showThe 40-year-old UK helicopter flying in Ukraine"

        "name": "The cost of the Ukraine war for one Russian regiment",
        "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-65179074",
        "text": "Kostroma is not a bad place to go looking for the effects of the Ukraine war on Russia. For this city is home to a celebrated regiment that bears its name and has been in the forefront of all the main battles in the Kremlin's campaign against its neighbours.  The 331st Guards Parachute Regiment, often called the Kostroma Airborne Regiment, has been the subject of investigations by BBC's Newsnight since shortly after last February's invasion. These have revealed the price paid by the regiment and its home community. We had confirmed 39 fatalities by April last year, 62 by late July, and now the toll has reached 94.  Much of the work compiling this list has involved combing social media accounts on V'Kontakte, the Russian equivalent of Facebook, and local media reporting. We can then cross reference this with satellite and Google Street View imagery. One video discovered on V'Kontakte showed soldiers' graves at a cemetery north-east of Kostroma. The graves shown in the videos match the names of the soldiers we have collated.The actual number of 331st's dead is probably much higher. Some of the soldiers are from towns outside Kostroma, which makes tracking down information about them much more difficult. Several soldiers have been reported missing - some of these may count among the dead.When one considers those seriously wounded or taken prisoner, it's reasonable to assume that the Ukraine war has cost the regiment several hundred soldiers.The loss of life has caused much comment in Kostroma, which lies about 300km (186 miles) north-east of Moscow and has a population of around a quarter of a million. One local website noted last spring that the entire Soviet-Afghan war, lasting nine years, had cost the city 56 soldiers. Heavy losses in Ukraine have given the local authorities a difficult task of political management.  Sergey Sitnikov, Kostroma's Kremlin-appointed governor, has been in the forefront of attempts to convince people that the city's soldiers are being properly supported. Gov Sitnikov's visits to hospitals, barracks, and indeed to the front, have been covered on local TV. On a visit to the front in December, Gov Sitnikov told viewers that \"we need to help [the] guys so they have decent conditions\". He had brought with him crowd-funded care packages and commercially sold drones.  Gov Sitnikov is Vladimir Putin's placeman in his home region, so he's hardly a rebel or fearless teller of uncomfortable truths. But his willingness to visit the front and acknowledge shortcomings, even in a coded way, marks an interesting contrast with his boss.  When local TV showed mobilised paratroopers on the 331st's parade ground six months ago, it also carried Gov Sitnikov's rather frank remarks to them: \"I'm wishing you good health, success, completion of all tasks\u2026 and that you return home alive.\" The call-up of paratroopers, part of Russia's wider mobilisation, underlines the degree to which the Ukraine campaign has exhausted the country's professional army, of which the 331st has been a showpiece. In footage of November's parade, 150 conscripts were shown before their dispatch to the front. The total size of the 331st regiment could be estimated at 1,500-1,700. When it first sent into Ukraine in February 2022, it deployed two battalion groups, giving a total of 1,000-1,200 soldiers. After taking heavy casualties in the failed attempt to reach Kyiv, the regiment was withdrawn and rebuilt in the southern Russian garrison town of Belgorod last summer.  Subsequent action has seen the regiment moving around all the major flashpoints - Izyum in the early summer, Kherson later on, and now back to Donbas. By monitoring the dates given in the death announcements on Kostroma social media, it's possible to work out when (and often where) the unit was used to spearhead assaults, and the lulls when it was removed from the line to lick its wounds.  For example, a cluster of deaths in February point to elements of the 331st being engaged in Kreminna. Mark Urban reports on how the Russian 331st Regiment, and their families, are coping with Vladimir Putin's long warEach time casualty replacements - including the conscripts shown on TV in November - are brought in to replace losses, the original cadre of soldiers gets smaller, and the overall size of the unit diminishes. It may now number no more than 300-400 at the front.   The losses, and indeed the return of badly wounded men, have resonated in the home community. A few weeks into the war, one user of V'Kontake exclaimed, \"Almost every day photos of our Kostroma boys get published. It sends shivers down my spine. What's happening? When will this end?\" Local media has been featuring commemorations of fallen Kostroma soldiers. In December, a TV station featured the unveiling of a plaque to Eduard Reunov, a paratrooper in the 331st who was killed in Ukraine. The style of this memorial and the language used in the report can be seen as an attempt to channel the Great Patriotic War (as the Russians call their 1941-45 fight against the Nazis), implying that today's soldiers are engaged in an equally important cause.  But on social media, we've found more modern manifestations of remembrance, and even people seeking revenge. Soldiers are shown holding shells with messages scribbled on them from Reunov's former classmates, and, supposedly, his family.  There's a trend seen in a few Russian garrison towns, for wives and mothers to post pictures of themselves with an absent soldier's uniform. One tearful mother of a dead paratrooper from the 331st remembers the Great Patriotic War, and adds, \"I hope there will be stories written about our guys\".Those questioning the sacrifice tend to get short shrift. \"Ukraine isn't my Motherland, our boys are dying for nothing,\" one person recently wrote on Kostroma's V'Kontakte page. Another swiftly countered, \"That's a stupid opinion. No point in writing that stuff here\". It's evident from coverage of Gov Sitnikov's activities that the authorities are trying to mollify those who are anxious about the killed and wounded. It's not clear how much support the war has from the wider Russian public, but the video we've seen suggests there's a good deal of solidarity among military families in Kostroma.The 331st's decline can also be measured in loss to machinery as well as personnel - particularly airborne infantry combat vehicles, known by the Russian initials BMD - that have been used up in successive battles. Initially, when the 331st was part of an Airborne Forces task force pushing towards Kyiv, we had difficulty identifying its vehicles in video of the fighting. A painted \"V\" was used to identify units from all of the various units in that task force, and an inverted triangle symbol with a \"3\" in the centre was also used by one other regiment apart from the 331st. As the fighting wore on, soldiers in the 331st added a further ad hoc marking to the V on their vehicles' sides - an exclamation mark painted next to the V. They may have done this precisely so their commanders could distinguish their armour from the other regiments'. Consequently we were able to identify individual BMDs from the 331st being loaded up on railcars in March 2022, following their withdrawal from Ukraine. They then reappeared in Donbas during last summer's fighting.Open source analysts have also identified at least 25 destroyed BMDs marked in this way, by combing Ukrainian military social media accounts. As with the dead soldiers, this visible loss does not represent the total, since many other BMDs belonging to the Kostroma regiment have likely been lost outside the view of Ukrainian troops.  A report broadcast in February 2023 by the Russian network NTV shows an \"armoured group\" of the 331st in action in Luhansk. But it just tends to confirm the impression we've gleaned from other sources that the regiment survives as small detachments able to spearhead certain missions. From the call signs seen on camera this element consists of just three BMD armoured vehicles.   So, the regiment's long war goes on. Of the war's wider effects on the Ukrainian population you will glean little from Russian media, nor is there any frank coverage of war-crime allegations.  The 331st were accused of massacring hundreds of Ukrainian soldiers during fighting in 2014. For many Ukrainians, the latest Russian losses may seem like nothing more than the paratroopers getting their just deserts. Meanwhile, in Kostroma's graveyard there is plenty of evidence of the price of failure in Russia's invasion. Buried too is the regiment's reputation as \"the best of the best\", and its dreams of easy victory. "

        "name": "The 40-year-old British helicopter flying in Ukraine",
        "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-65242823",
        "text": "A military helicopter donated to Ukraine by the UK government was used in the Falklands conflict more than 40 years ago, the BBC has learned. Despite its age, the Ukrainian military says the aircraft will help in the war against Russia. Flying low in the skies over southern Ukraine, the helicopter swoops and turns, following the contours of the ground. From the cockpit and open side door, the crew scan the horizon, alert for potential threats.We are on board one of two Sea King helicopters Britain has given Ukraine - the first media to gain access to the aircraft since they were delivered in recent months. Inside, the mood is serious and purposeful, the menace of Russian missiles not far away. Despite this, the four-man crew is enjoying showing off the new helicopter. They tell us how important it is for them on the battlefield, where it is used for rescuing casualties, moving troops, and carrying out reconnaissance.But why is Britain giving Ukraine such old helicopters, some of which have been flying for more than four decades? The government in Kyiv asked for modern fighter jets armed with long-range missiles to help in a much-anticipated new offensive against Russian forces.  But the UK has not given any of its Typhoon fighter jets to Ukraine - it does not have enough to spare, and it would take too long to train Ukrainian pilots to use them. There are also broader fears that giving warplanes could escalate the conflict.Instead, the UK chose to give them two helicopters that do not carry any weapons or fly particularly fast, and which are no longer used by the Royal Navy, which pensioned the Sea Kings off several years ago. One of them is so old it even saw service during the Falklands conflict, back in 1982, where it played an historic role.The answer to the choice of aircraft can also be found partly here in Ukraine. The crew are clearly passionate about their new helicopter. Co-pilot, Vasil, says the Sea King was just what Ukraine's Navy needed - a practical, reliable aircraft that can do whatever is asked of it. \"I like this helicopter because it is incredibly good for flying,\" Vasil says. \"It's one of the best for combat operations, whether transporting equipment or carrying out search and rescue. It is easy to fly even in difficult conditions.\"The Sea Kings are being used to pick up casualties needing urgent medical help, move special forces into position, and fetch and carry equipment.Vasil says one key task is searching for downed pilots, which can involve flying behind enemy lines. \"Pilots have to eject,\" he says. \"They need to be rescued. For this, we have to reach territory which is possibly not under Ukrainian control.\"He also emphasises that the Sea Kings are of a similar age to several other helicopters used by Ukraine's armed forces. As such, he and other pilots are familiar with aircraft of that vintage, making their training easier.\"It is spacious, it has good load capacity and it is economical,\" Vasil adds.Another answer to the question about the aircraft's age can be found, perhaps, at a base in southern England, where a third Sea King, which will be delivered to Ukraine in the coming weeks, is being prepared. We cannot say where the base is for security reasons, but we spoke to two Ukrainian engineers who have been there for seven months, training to repair and maintain the helicopter.One engineer, Ihor, tells me that the Sea Kings are in fact mostly new, with very little of the original helicopter remaining. \"They are old,\" he says, \"but they have gone through modernisation, and we need them very much. I believe this is just the start of our work together.\"These Sea Kings have spent much of their lives carrying out search and rescue operations - for civilians as well as service personnel - and have been familiar sights over Britain's coasts. One of the two currently in Ukraine was flown by Ralph Wickes-Sneyd in the Falklands in 1982 - he commanded the squadron of which it was part. The retired naval pilot says the helicopter played an historic role, flying through a storm on 14 June 1982 to take the commander of British land forces - Gen Jeremy Moore - to Port Stanley so he could accept the Argentine surrender. No other aircraft could fly due to the bad weather, he says. \"It was quite an interesting operation,\" Mr Wickes-Sneyd explains. \"The ceasefire hadn't been signed up to this stage, and so the aircraft was flying into Stanley competing not just with the weather, but also some still rather unfriendly Argentines.\" The pilot also revealed that the Sea King that he flew - the one now in Ukraine - was also flown in the Falklands by Prince Andrew, then serving as a young naval pilot.\"He would have flown the aircraft from time to time,\" Mr Wickes-Sneyd says. \"It was his first tour. So he did what everybody else did, which was sometimes pretty mundane, sometimes quite exciting.\"These Sea Kings may be old, they may be few in number, and they may not be the fixed wing aircraft Kyiv wants to help turn the military balance. But the navy in Ukraine says it is happy to have them - and it wants more. There are other Sea Kings in storage in the UK, and if the government decided to give them to Ukraine, the crew and engineers we spoke to said they would be more than welcome.Pilot Vasil says that getting hold of a Sea King is like replacing your old car with a classic \"foreign car\".\"It is so practical. We would like to receive more helicopters like these,\" he says.Back in England, engineer Ihor concedes new aircraft would perhaps be better, but adds: \"It's better than nothing and it's only the beginning.\"What weapons are being supplied to Ukraine?"

Back home, she ran a successful wedding-dress business and her sponsor suggested she start it up again. \"It's a crazy idea, but I think I can try... my profession is my life,\" she says.A friend of Yulia's husband, who was driving to the UK, brought over her sewing machines, fabrics and mannequins. \"It's not easy because system of business in England is different, it's not like in Ukraine,\" says Yulia.She struggled to make her wedding-dress business off the ground in the UK, so decided to use her skills and passion to find a full-time sewing job. Yulia says, although it's been disappointing not to be able to keep her business going, she is happy with her new life.\"We have a nice place, we have nice work, family...

The couple fled to Kyiv where they set up another business selling plants. But when Russia invaded the family were forced to flee again - this time to join friends in Perth, Western Australia. \"Could you imagine just to leave your house? To leave you business? To leave your friends?\" Regina asks.\"Even [after] one year passed I just feel this fear inside, you are not sure what's going to happen.\"Regina says the welcome they received in Australia gave them the belief that they could start again. Vlodymyr now works full-time because the business in Ukraine makes just 10% of what it did before the war. Regina told us: \"When you trust that there is a future for you, you buy plants.\"The people in Ukraine now are so exhausted, so tired by the war they are losing their trust.\""

        "name": "What the leaked Pentagon documents reveal - 8 key takeaways",
        "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-65238951",
        "text": "A cache of classified US documents leaked online sheds new light on American intelligence gathered about other countries.Images of the covert files have appeared on messaging app Discord since early March.Complete with timelines and dozens of military acronyms, the documents, some marked \"top secret\", paint a detailed picture of the war in Ukraine and also offer information on China and allies.Pentagon officials are quoted as saying the documents are real.BBC News and other news organisations have reviewed the documents and these are some of the key findings.The US believed the UN secretary general's stance on a key grain deal was undermining attempts to hold Russia accountable for the war in Ukraine.Antonio Guterres was too willing to accommodate Russian interests, according to files which suggest Washington has been closely monitoring him.Several documents describe private communications involving Mr Guterres and his deputy.One leaked document focuses on the Black Sea grain deal, brokered by the UN and Turkey in July following fears of a global food crisis.It suggests that Mr Guterres was so keen to preserve the deal that he was willing to give in to Russia's demands - a stance which was \"undermining broader efforts to hold Russia accountable\".While the bulk of the leaked documents concern, in one way or another, the war in Ukraine, there are others that touch on a huge range of unrelated issues. Many of them shed light on some of Washington's global preoccupations.Like the spread and purpose of Chinese technology.Three documents based on intelligence from late February detail discussions among senior Jordanian officials over whether or not to shut the Chinese firm Huawei out of its 5G rollout plans.Jordan's Crown Prince Hussein, in charge of the rollout, is said in the document to be worried about retaliation from China if they keep Huawei out.Nor is this the only place where fears about Chinese technology are revealed Another document marked top secret addresses China's \"developing cyber-attack capabilities.\" It says these are designed \"to deny, exploit, and hijack satellite links and networks as part of its strategy to control information, which it considers to be a key warfighting domain.\"Newly discovered documents suggest Russian officials are at loggerheads over the reporting of casualties.The main intelligence agency, the FSB, has \"accused\" the country's defence ministry of playing down the human impact of the war, the files show. These findings show the extent to which the US agencies have penetrated the Russian intelligence and military.One document, dated 23 March, refers to the presence of a small number of Western special forces operating inside Ukraine, without specifying their activities or location. The UK has the largest contingent (50), followed by Latvia (17), France (15), the US (14) and the Netherlands (1). Western governments typically refrain from commenting on such sensitive matters, but this detail is likely to be seized upon by Moscow, which has in recent months argued that it is not just confronting Ukraine, but Nato as well.Other documents say when a dozen new Ukrainian brigades - being prepared for an offensive that could begin within weeks - will be ready. They list, in great detail, the tanks, armoured vehicles and artillery pieces that are being provided by Ukraine's Western allies.One map includes a timeline that assesses ground conditions across eastern Ukraine as spring progresses.According to the Washington Post newspaper, one document from early February expresses misgivings about Ukraine's chances of success in its forthcoming counteroffensive, saying that problems with generating and sustaining sufficient forces could result in \"modest territorial gains\".Ukraine's difficulties in maintaining its vital air defences are also analysed, with warnings from late February that Kyiv might run out of critical missiles. This video can not be playedWatch: The Pentagon leaks explained in under 60 seconds.Casualty figures are also listed. One slide refers to as many as 223,000 Russian soldiers killed or wounded, and as many as 131,000 Ukrainians.Some Ukrainian officials have dismissed the leaks, suggesting they might constitute a Russian disinformation campaign. But there are signs of frustration and anger too. One presidential advisor, Mykhailo Podolyak, tweeted: \"We need less contemplation on 'leaks' and more long-range weapons in order to properly end the war.\"The Washington Post obtained access to another document from mid-February, where they found that Egypt had plans to produce 40,000 rockets for Russia in secret.The Post said President Abdul Fatah al-Sisi told officials to keep production and shipment secret \"to avoid problems with the West\". An official is quoted as saying he would \"order his people to work shift work if necessary because it was the least Egypt could do to repay Russia for unspecified help earlier\". It is unclear what the earlier help refers to. In January, Reuters reported that Russia's share of Egyptian wheat imports had risen in 2022, offering one possible explanation.There is no indication that Egypt - a recipient of US security assistance, worth around $1bn a year - went ahead with the proposed sale to Russia. An unnamed official quoted on Egyptian news channels described the allegation as \"utterly baseless\" and said Cairo did not take sides in the war.The Kremlin called it \"just another canard\" and the White House said there was \"no indication\" Egypt was providing lethal weapons to Russia.This video can not be playedExpert: US and Egypt ready to move forward after leakA classified document, seen by the BBC, reveals that South Korea was torn about selling weapons for use in Ukraine. The report, based on signals intelligence, details a sensitive conversation between national security advisers. They are torn between US pressure to send ammunition to Ukraine and their policy not to arm countries at war.One of the advisers suggests sending the shells to Poland instead, to avoid appearing to have given in to the US.As part of a resupply deal last year, Seoul insisted that the US could not pass the shells on to Ukraine. Seoul has been reluctant to arm Ukraine, for fear of antagonising Russia. The leak has triggered security concerns in Seoul, with opposition politicians questioning how the US was able to intercept such a high-level conversation. The Post also found that Beijing tested one of its experimental missiles - the DF-27 hypersonic glide vehicle - on 25 February.The missile flew for 12 minutes over a distance of 2,100km (1,300 miles), according to the documents.

More than 40 others - amounting to nearly half the country - are already at \"alert\" or \"vigilance\" levels, presaging even worse shortages than last year. In parts of the district, aquifer levels are so low that experts fear saline seepage from the sea, which would make tap water undrinkable. Low aquifer levels also mean a higher concentration of pollutants, which could likewise severely damage water quality.President Emmanuel Macron last month announced a nationwide water programme, with promises of investment to curb leaks and increase recycling. He also outlined a \"progressive water tariff\" under which consumption above a certain quantity - for example, for swimming pools - would be charged at higher rates.Some 2,000 villages and towns are at risk of losing their water supply this year, according to Mr B\u00e9chu.

        "text": "Russian ships able to perform underwater operations were present near to where explosions later took place on the Nord Stream pipelines, according to an investigative documentary. The vessels were reportedly located using intercepted Russian navy communications.Underwater explosions last September knocked the two Nord Stream pipelines - built to carry gas from Russia to Europe - out of action.The cause of the blasts is unclear.Formal investigations are still taking place in countries close to the blast site. So far, they have said only that they believe the explosions were the result of sabotage rather than any kind of accident.But one possible lead pointing towards Russian involvement has emerged from details of suspicious Russian ship movements in the run-up to the Nord Stream blasts, reported by four Nordic public broadcasters and an accompanying .And Denmark's Defence Command has confirmed a separate report that a Danish patrol boat called Nymfen took 26 photos of a Russian submarine-rescue ship in the area days before the explosions.  and was close to Bornholm island on 22 September 2022.The investigation by Denmark's DR, Norway's NRK, Sweden's SVT, and Finland's Yle focuses on the movements and actions of ships between June and September last year which they describe as highly unusual.The ships are believed to include the Russian naval research vessel Sibiryakov, the tugboat SB-123, and a third ship from the Russian naval fleet that the media outlets have not been able to identify by name.These were so-called \"ghost-ships\", which had their transmitters turned off. The broadcasters, however, say they were able to track their movements, using intercepted radio communications the vessels sent to Russian naval bases.The first vessel departed from a Russian naval base in Kaliningrad before arriving near the pipeline on 7 June. One radio message places it directly above Nord Stream 2 before moving further north, close to the Nord Stream 1 pipelines, spending hours in the area where the pipeline runs about 80m (260ft) below the surface and where some of the leaks would later occur.The Sibiryakov arrived on 14 June and went to the same position as the first vessel, close to Nord Stream, and remained there until the next day. The movements were tracked by a former British naval intelligence officer, who worked on interception of the Russian Baltic Fleet until he retired in 2018. The anonymous officer says he used open-source information and radio communications to carry out his research.He says the pattern of radio communications in June indicated they were in an \"operational phase\" at some points.The tugboat, the SB-123, sailed out to the area on the evening of 21 September. The broadcasters say they intercepted communications that suggest it was operating close to the pipelines and the areas of the explosion from late that evening until around 14:00 on 22 September.The tugboat is also mentioned in the story about the SS-750 submarine-rescue ship, which followed up  of suspected Russian involvement in the area.This video can not be playedUnderwater drone footage of the damage to the Nord Stream pipelineSatellite imagery examined by the broadcasters is said to support the claims about the unusual routes, and other reports in Germany had claimed it was in the area on 21-22 September.  The Sibiryakov is believed to be capable of underwater surveillance and mapping as well as launching a small underwater vehicle. It can be used to support and rescue submarines and has the ability to carry out operations on the seabed, according to experts interviewed by the broadcasters.The Nordic broadcasters do not say there is conclusive proof of what the vessels were up to or that Russia was behind the blast. But the documentary raises questions about the unusual nature of the activity.  Last month the series revealed that Russian vessels appeared to be mapping out wind farms in the North Sea, including off the UK coast.Russia has consistently denied any involvement in the blasts.In the immediate aftermath, some in the West pointed the finger at Russia, while Moscow blamed Western countries, including the UK.More recently, there were reports that intelligence pointed towards pro-Ukrainian operatives, although not the Ukrainian government itself.The Russian ships accused of North Sea sabotageA journey to the site of the Nord Stream explosionsBehind the spies\u2019 attempts to stop the war in Ukraine"

        "text": "A dramatic statement from the Russian presidential administration claimed that Ukraine had used two drones to attack the Kremlin - at the heart of Moscow - overnight. Russian forces apparently used radar equipment to disable the drones. There were no casualties, and the president was unhurt, it said. But the Kremlin did call it . . They appear to show at least one drone flying towards the Kremlin, followed by an explosion. Another appears to show smoke rising from a Kremlin structure, and a fire. The BBC has been unable to verify that it was a drone and it is unclear what really happened. But if what the Kremlin is saying is true, and this was a genuine attempt on the president's life, then it would be a highly embarrassing incident for the Kremlin. By all accounts, Mr Putin appears to be one of the most closely-guarded leaders in the world. At his events in Moscow attended by BBC journalists, extremely tight security has been in place, including extensive checks and long convoys of vehicles, with airspace closed and traffic halted.  Questions will now be asked about how well-protected the Russian leader is - and about the effectiveness of Russian air defences.In recent months, anti-aircraft systems have been spotted on Moscow rooftops in the vicinity of key buildings, including the defence ministry. They have been placed there precisely for this reason - because the Kremlin is concerned that Ukraine, or those sympathetic to Ukraine, may attempt to carry out aerial attacks on high-value targets. If that's what this incident was, then those measures failed. This video can not be playedWATCH: Russian video circulates after Kremlin attack claimsThis is the latest in a string of attacks and explosions that have hit Russian territory in recent weeks and months.The last few days have seen a spike in such incidents. On Wednesday morning, a fuel depot caught fire in Russia's Krasnodar Region, reportedly caused by a drone attack. Two freight trains were derailed in Bryansk Region, near the border with Ukraine, on Monday and Tuesday, in separate but identical incidents. The local governor said improvised explosive devices were to blame. Over the weekend, Russia-installed officials in occupied Crimea claimed Ukrainian drones were responsible for an attack on a fuel storage facility. The frequency of such attacks is causing nervousness amongst ordinary Russians. Russian media report that police in Moscow have been inundated with calls from the public reporting drone sightings in the capital. Ukraine has vehemently denied attacking the Kremlin or targeting President Putin. But whether the Russian account of what happened is accurate or not, the question now is whether Moscow will respond - and if so, how.Some Russian officials have already called for tough action. An assassination attempt against the president, if that's what this was, is an extremely serious matter. Russian generals have warned many times of harsh responses to strikes on Russian territory. But does Russia have the capacity to carry out any meaningful retaliatory strikes? It remains to be seen whether this incident will lead to any significant escalation on the battlefield.

In a statement, it said the Bayraktar TB2 UAV [unmanned aerial vehicle] had lost control around at 20:00 (17:00 GMT) in the Kyiv region, during a scheduled flight.It added that it had taken a decision to shoot it down \"since the uncontrolled presence of UAVs in the sky of the capital could lead to undesirable consequences\".

        "text": "Job creation in the US remained robust last month, despite turmoil in the banking sector and the impact of higher borrowing costs.Employers added 253,000 jobs, which was better than many analysts had expected.The unemployment rate fell to 3.4%, returning to a multi-decade low. The gains were a reminder of the resilience of the US labour market, which has held up in the face of aggressive efforts by the US central bank to cool the economy.The Federal Reserve has raised its benchmark interest rate from near zero to between 5% and 5.25% in little over a year, an abrupt shift aimed at curbing prices that were soaring last year at the fastest pace in decades.These increases have sharply increased the cost of buying a home or car, as well as making it more expensive to borrow to expand a business or take on other debt. In theory, that should reduce demand, leading the economy to slow and easing the pressures pushing up prices.But while job gains have moderated since last year, they continue to outpace the numbers that economists estimate are needed to keep up with population growth. In its Friday report, the Labor Department said hiring had been weaker than previously estimated in February and March.But last month, job creation picked up again, while wages were up 4.4% from a year ago. \"Today's report clearly suggests weakening labour markets - most obviously in the downward revisions of prior months data - but from a very strong starting point,\" said Ronald Temple, chief market strategist at Lazard.Many economists expect the US economy to fall into recession later this year, noting big slowdowns in key sectors such as housing.Recent weeks have seen a flurry of job cut announcements by big companies such as Facebook-owner Meta, Amazon, entertainment giant Disney, banks and other firms.The rate rises also contributed to turmoil in the banking sector, which has been rocked by the most serious string of failures since the 2008 financial crisis. But the head of the US central bank, Jerome Powell, said this week that the continuing strength of the labour market made him hopeful that this time would be \"different\" - and the US could avoid a downturn that would throw millions of people out of work. \"That would be against history,\" he acknowledged. \"I fully appreciate that.\"Software engineer Brian Zovko was laid off from his job in the car industry in February. He said he was surprised because his company had been posting strong profits. But more recently bosses had raised the prospect of cost cuts, noting that they were concerned about the impact of higher borrowing costs and a slowdown in the economy. The 27-year-old, who lives in Texas, says he has been relying on savings and trying to spend cautiously. He said he sensed that the market has cooled over the past few months - but he remained hopeful he would find a new job shortly.\"I'm mildly optimistic that I should be able to get back on track,\" he said.

        "name": "Ukraine war: Bakhmut defender remembered by comrades",
        "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-65313367",
        "text": "Staff sergeant Pavel Kuzin took his position at the machine gun - the only soldier still able to fight. Everyone else in his troop lay dead or injured. Suffering from shell-shock and with one arm bandaged, the 37-year-old fired at the waves of Russian soldiers trying to storm his position. They didn't even try to take cover, but simply walked towards him across the open field. It was clear Pavel wouldn't be able to hold the position for long, but he needed to buy time for a rescue team to arrive. His final action in life was to ensure his wounded comrades got to safety.The Ukrainian military says Bakhmut is now the scene of many \"unprecedentedly bloody\" battles like this, where they now have to repel up to 50 attacks on their positions every day. Russia has concentrated massive forces in this area, and their brutal strategy of launching human wave attacks helps them to advance slowly - but at a very high cost.Pavel was in charge of a forward observation group that consisted of six Ukrainian soldiers. On 17 February, shortly after the start of their watch, they came under heavy fire. A tank began hammering their position. Unlike relentless mortar rounds, the tank's aiming was chillingly accurate. Shells were landing a few metres from their trenches. Two soldiers were wounded and Pavel told them to go into a dugout. A combat medic went down to tend to their injuries and prepare them for an evacuation. Moments later, the wooden shelter was directly hit by a shell.\"There was a bright flash,\" one of the wounded soldiers with a callsign Tsygan told the BBC. \"I was thrown onto the logs with such force that it nearly crushed me. I couldn't understand whether I was dead or alive. Someone was shouting, it seemed the sound was coming from 100m away.\"  It was Pavel's voice who was checking on them. The other soldier was half-buried under dirt and logs. He was dead. Tsygan could barely move and Pavel had to drag him up over the splintered logs that blocked the way. It was painfully slow to move Tsygan just a few metres away into a nearby trench. When the shelling paused briefly, Pavel went back trying to find others.  Two minesweepers arrived to clear the logs and find the bodies. But yet another shell hit the dug out, killing one of the men and injuring the other. The tank kept firing. At that moment, Russian troops started storming their position. Pavel called for a support group to evacuate the wounded and rushed back to his Browning machine gun to stop the Russian infantry.  The 206th Battalion in which Pavel served had fought in the southern Kherson and north-eastern Kharkiv regions. But the battles over Bakhmut were very different from what they had seen before.  \"The intensity of fighting to break through our positions was shocking,\" says Mykola Hlabets, platoon commander. \"Sometimes, [Russian soldiers] would get as close as 20 metres from us, crawling and moving under a treeline or across an open field. This is where we had our first gunfights at such proximity.\" \"They would just stand and walk towards our positions without any cover. We wiped out one group after another, but they kept coming.\"  Hlabets described them as a suicide squad. Others call them cannon fodder. A number of videos have been shared on telegram channels recently where newly mobilized Russian soldiers appealed to President Vladimir Putin and the authorities to stop what they called \"illegal orders\" to send them \"to be slaughtered\". Last month mobilised soldiers from Belgorod posted a video saying that they were sent for an assault mission without proper training. After suffering heavy losses, they said they refused to carry out their orders.Often these poorly trained soldiers are reportedly forced to keep pushing forward. The assault group Storm of the 5th Brigade of the Russian army said in a video appeal that they couldn't leave their position because of zagryad otryad, or blocking troops - detachments that open fire at their own men who try to retreat.  These wave attacks are similar to World War One tactics, when troops charged the enemy and engaged in close combat. And despite their lack of training and experience, sending newly recruited soldiers to such assaults are bringing some results for Russia, albeit at a very high cost.Ukrainians expose their positions when they open fire to stop those attacks. That allows Russian artillery to identify the target and destroy it, as happened with Pavel's post.  Also, soldiers at forward positions run out of ammunition while trying to repel numerous wave attacks. They then become an easy target. That was the risk Pavel knew he faced as he rushed to his Browning machine gun. But as long as he kept firing, his wounded brothers-in-arms had a chance to be rescued.  Tsygan was bleeding in the trench where Pavel had left him. Shrapnel had smashed his pelvis. Another piece had gone through his thigh, and a third had hit his abdomen, \"turning the internal organs upside down\", he said. He was barely conscious.  \"I didn't see much, it was all white,\" he said. \"I lay on the snowy ground for two hours and I didn't feel cold or anything.\" Next to him was another wounded soldier. The rescue team on an armoured personnel carrier hastily picked them up as shelling resumed. They didn't even have time to close the hatch, Tsygan says.  By that time, Pavel's machine gun had fallen silent. He died from a head wound: a piece of shrapnel had pierced his helmet.  Commanders of the 206th battalion decided to send a group to retrieve the bodies of Pavel and the other soldiers.  The next day in the evening, three groups of two soldiers each set off to bring the bodies back. \"The plan looked good on paper, but things quickly went wrong,\" junior sergeant Vasyl Palamarchuk, who was in the lead group, remembers. They got lost and nearly ran into Russian positions in the dark. When they got close to the dugout, Russians spotted them and opened fire from a tank.  Russian tanks and artillery had continuously shelled that post in those days, but the Ukrainian big guns had largely stayed quiet. The reason was a massive shortage of shells. \"Once we counted that the Russians had fired up to 60 shells a day, whereas we could allow only two,\" Palamarchuk explains. \"They destroyed trees and everything else and you had no place to hide.\"  Ukraine is struggling to find ammunition for its Soviet-era artillery. Getting shells for weapons donated by Ukraine's western partners has its own limits. As the secretary general of the Nato military alliance, Jens Stoltenberg, said recently: \"The current rate of Ukraine's ammunition expenditure is many times higher than our current rate of production.\" Palamarchuk's group eventually picked up Pavel's body just a few hours before Russian troops seized the area. Heavy snow turned into a freezing rain. After numerous breaks on the way back, crawling through craters left by shells, they finally arrived. The whole operation over just a kilometre's distance lasted for six hours. It was past midnight but the entire battalion gathered at the evacuation point to pay their respects to Pavel, who is survived by his daughter and wife.  \"It was a huge loss for our unit,\" Palamarchuk says. \"He saved two people but died himself.\"Meet the hacker armies on Ukraine's cyber front line'I looked at my foot and saw I was missing toes'The Russian ships accused of North Sea sabotage"

        "name": "The guitarist who saved hundreds of people on a sinking cruise liner",
        "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-60841291",
        "text": "When the luxury liner Oceanos started taking on water in rough seas during a voyage around the coast of South Africa in 1991, musician Moss Hills and his colleagues suddenly found themselves responsible for everyone on board.  It was during dinner that Moss Hills began to realise just how severe the storm was. The ship's waiters, normally completely adept at carrying drinks and food without spilling anything, were struggling. Moss, a guitarist from Zimbabwe working on board the cruise liner alongside his wife Tracy, a bass player, had never seen the waiters dropping trays before.   Earlier that day, gale-force winds and heavy rains had delayed sailing for the final leg of the cruise towards Durban several times. But with no sign of conditions improving, the captain eventually decided to lift anchor and the Oceanos, with 581 guests and crew on board, sailed off into 40-knot winds and 9m-high (30ft) waves. Moss and Tracy, both in their 30s, would usually host parties up on the pool deck as the ship sailed away from port. But that day the party had been moved indoors, and Moss braced his body while he played his guitar, trying to keep his balance as the ship pitched and rolled.\"The storm just got worse and worse,\" Moss says. At dinner, Tracy - who her husband describes as unflappable - decided to go to their cabin to organise an emergency bag, just in case.\"Off she went,\" Moss says, \"and suddenly - boom - all the lights went out.\" When none of the ship's officers appeared to issue instructions, Moss, who was not easily frightened, began to feel uneasy.\"You're on a ship in the middle of the ocean, in the dark of night, in a terrible storm,\" he says, \"I felt this tightening in my stomach.\"When small, dim emergency lights came on, Moss went up to the lounge to check on the musical instruments on stage. Microphone and cymbal stands were strewn about. Then he suddenly realised he couldn't hear the constant, throbbing, background noise of the engines. The ship had lost power and was slowing down. Soon the 153m (502ft) Oceanos was drifting sideways onto the crashing waves.The ship, says Moss, was getting hammered.Anxious guests began pouring into the lounge. Pot plants, ashtrays, and chairs were sliding around, and people had to move from their seats to sit on the floor as the ship lurched wildly from one side to the other, port to starboard.About an hour passed, and the mood in the lounge grew tense. Moss grabbed an acoustic guitar and began singing with some of the other entertainers to try to keep people calm. But as time stretched on, Moss noticed that the ship was heeling - no longer coming back to a level position when it was being thrown about in the storm. \"Something bad is happening,\" Moss said to Tracy, \"I'm going to try and find out what's going on.\"Hear Moss tell his story in a new series of  on 6 April 2022 at 0900 on BBC Radio 4 - or listen to the . More from Life Changing:Hanging on to the handrails, Moss and another entertainer, Julian, a magician from Yorkshire, made their way through the darkness below deck. They could hear excited voices speaking many different languages. Officers were running around, some were carrying bags, some had life jackets on, and some were wet. \"Everyone was pretty wild-eyed and panicked-looking,\" Moss says. \"We were trying to ask, 'What's happening?' but it was like we didn't exist.\"Julian and Moss continued down to the engine room - the lowest part of the ship.\"We were way below the waterline, in the dark, on our own, and there was no-one there,\" Moss says. \"That would never, ever happen, even when you're docked.\"The thick, metal doors which acted as a safety barrier by preventing water moving from one compartment of a ship to another in the event of flooding, were tightly closed.\"But it sounded like there was a large body of water sloshing about behind those watertight doors,\" Moss says.The Oceanos was sinking. Back up in the lounge, there had still not been any announcements about what was going on. Moss found the cruise director who said the captain had told her they were going to have to abandon the ship. \"Then we found out that one lifeboat had already gone with a lot of the crew and senior officers on it,\" he says.Moss and the others had no idea how to evacuate a cruise ship, nor how to launch the lifeboats which hung high above the deck along each of the ship's sides, but there was nobody more qualified around to do it.One by one, they began lowering the starboard side lifeboats down to the deck. They didn't know how to keep them steady as people got on, so Moss improvised by standing with one leg on the deck of the ship and the other on a lifeboat. But each time the ship rolled to starboard, Moss would have to jump back onto the Oceanos before the lifeboat swung away, opening up a gap of a couple of metres, and then swung back, smashing with such force against the ship's hull that bits of it came splintering off.Each heaving lifeboat, now with as many as 90 people in it, many screaming in fear, would then be lowered down to the sea on cables. But Moss had no idea how to start the engines or even where the keys were.\"We'd let them go, off into the night, and they would just drift away into the pounding waves,\" he says. \"The people in the lifeboats had a torturous time - they were getting deluged in spray, it was cold and completely dark, but we just had to carry on until all of the starboard side lifeboats were launched.\"By now the Oceanos was taking in more and more water and heeling markedly to its starboard side. Launching the remaining lifeboats on the port side safely was near impossible.Instead of being lowered down to the water once loaded up with people, the lifeboats would cling to the side of the ship until the next big wave rolled in, tipping the ship enough to let them dangle freely.\"And then gravity would suddenly drop the lifeboat three or four metres (13 ft) in one go, almost tipping people out into the open water, it was horrific,\" Moss says.Eventually, he realised it was too dangerous to continue.  \"In the effort to try and rescue people we were possibly going to kill them,\" Moss says.And time was running out.Unable to launch any more lifeboats, but with hundreds of people still in need of rescue, Moss and others made their way up to the ship's bridge - where they assumed they would find the captain and the remaining senior officers - to ask what to do next.\"We looked inside, but there was no one there,\" Moss says. \"That's when we realised - it's just us.\"Orangey-red lights blinked in the darkness, but Moss had no idea what most of the equipment was for, never mind how it worked. They took turns trying to use the radio to send an SOS.  \"I was calling, 'Mayday! Mayday! Mayday!' and just waiting for somebody to answer,\" Moss says.A big, deep, rich voice eventually replied. \"Yes, what is your Mayday?\"Relieved, Moss explained that he was on the cruise ship Oceanos and that it was sinking.\"OK. How long have you got left to float?\"\"I don't know - we've got the starboard railings in the water, we're rolling around, we've taken on a huge amount of water,\" Moss said. \"We still have at least 200 people on board.\"\"OK. What is your position?\"\"We're probably about halfway between the port of East London and Durban.\"\"No, no, no, what are your coordinates?\"Moss had no idea what their coordinates were.\"What rank are you?\"\"Well, I'm not a rank - I'm a guitarist.\"A moment's silence.\"What are you doing on the bridge?\"\"Well, there's nobody else here.\"\"Who's on the bridge with you?\"\"So I said, 'It's me, my wife - the bass player, we've got a magician here\u2026'\"Moss was put in contact with two small ships that were close to the Oceanos. They told Moss to find the captain and get him onto the bridge. But Moss had no idea where he was.\"I knew he wouldn't be down below because we were sinking,\" he says. \"I was making regular checks to see where the water level was, and one deck below us was flooded.\"Eventually, Moss found the captain, right at the back of the ship, smoking in the darkness. Moss explained that they needed his help - urgently.\"He was just looking at me, wide-eyed and vacant, saying, 'It's not necessary, it's not necessary,'\" Moss says.\"I think he was in deep, deep shock.\"The two ships close to the Oceanos had only one lifeboat each, so there was little they could do to help. They shared the sinking vessel's coordinates with the South African authorities who began to organise an air rescue mission. As the storm continued to batter the ship, Moss and Tracy sat together in the near darkness, praying that help would arrive before it was too late. \"I think the ship is going to go down and it's very likely we're going to go down with it,\" Moss said to his wife.He and Tracy had a 15-year-old daughter, Amber, who'd been on board the Oceanos for the holidays and disembarked just days earlier. Amber was now back at boarding school in South Africa.\"She can't lose both parents,\" Moss remembers saying. \"Whatever we do, we've got to make sure at least one of us gets off.\"More than three hours passed before the first rescue helicopter arrived and hovered above the ship. Two navy divers were winched down to the Oceanos' deck. They said they needed help to get everyone off before the ship sank, and Moss was given a five-minute crash course on how to run a helicopter airlift.\"Remember, the harness needs to be quite tight under people's underarms,\" the navy diver told him. \"Make sure you get it right because otherwise they'll tip upside down and fall out - you'll kill them on the deck. Do two at a time or else we're going to run out of time. OK? Go.\"One navy diver went to organise the helicopter rescue at the rear of the ship and Tracy and Moss were to organise a second at the front. But as the ship sank ever lower beneath the waves, people began jumping off the steeply pitching deck in panic and a rigid inflatable had to be launched into the churning sea to rescue them. Dangling in mid-air from the helicopter cable, people who Moss was trying to save were being blown against parts of the ship by the strong winds as they were winched into the sky. There was no way of knowing how badly hurt they were and Moss momentarily lost his nerve. But with so many people still on board, he realised he had no choice but to keep going.In total, five helicopters joined the rescue mission, shuttling back and forth, carrying 12 people at a time to safety as dawn broke and the darkness lifted. Drained and exhausted, Moss and Tracy were among the last to be strapped into harnesses.\"As we were hovering above the ship it really hit me,\" Moss says, \"I could see the Oceanos was in a critical situation. We could see waves breaking over the bow where we had been rescuing people.\"When the helicopter carrying Moss touched down on the grass, cruise passengers ran towards him singing and cheering, and reaching out to hug him.\"I started to choke up and sob,\" Moss says, \"and then I collapsed.\"On 4 August 1991, about 45 minutes after the last person on board had been airlifted to safety, the Oceanos slipped away below the water. Everyone who had been put into lifeboats was rescued by passing ships and remarkably no lives were lost. Moss and Tracy, who now live in Liverpool, continued working as cruise ship entertainers for many years. Even now, three decades later, Tracy prefers not to talk about the sinking or dwell on how close they all came to losing their lives. But Moss, who's been asked about the Oceanos many, many times, finds it cathartic to talk about. He looks back on what happened with great relief.\"I'm not invincible,\" Moss says, \"but if I can get through that, I can get through anything.\"Listen to Moss Hills on  - producer Thomas Harding AssinderDo you have an extraordinary story to tell?

        "name": "Charity research finds that only 1% of disability hate crimes end with a charge",
        "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/disability-63171959",
        "text": "Of the thousands of disability hate crimes reported to the police last year, just 1% resulted in criminal charges, two charities have revealed.Leonard Cheshire and United Response submitted Freedom of Information requests to 43 police forces in England and Wales and 36 responded.It found that out of more than 11,000 reports, 99% of cases went no further.The National Police Chiefs' Council said it wanted \"to understand the reasons\" behind the low number.A hate crime is an offence which targets a victim's protected characteristics, including their race, religion, sexual orientation or disability.PhD student, Cassie Lovelock from London, told the  she has experienced physical and verbal abuse because of her disability many times.She has hereditary neuropathy with a liability for pressure palsies (HNPP), a rare condition with similar symptoms to MS, and often uses a wheelchair.On one occasion, while waiting for her boyfriend outside a shop, two drunk men grabbed her wheelchair and pushed her down the road while making sexual comments.Despite screaming for help, she claims passers-by ignored her. She eventually escaped by rolling her wheelchair into the road. , Cassie talks more about her experiences of disability hate crime and the team look at the support available.And a month into Prime Minister Liz Truss's premiership there's still no confirmation about who the new Minister of State for Disabled People will be\u2026or is there?On another occasion, Cassie was pushed out of her wheelchair by a woman who wanted to use the wheelchair space on a London bus for her pushchair.\"It was very humiliating,\" Cassie says. The bus driver witnessed the incident, helped Cassie and refused to let the other woman travel.Cassie says the incidents she has endured - including being shouted at on the street and accused of faking her disability - have all been \"intrinsically tied\" to her disability.But, she admits, she hasn't always reported her experiences immediately because she wasn't sure they would be considered hate crimes.Ali Gunn, policy lead for United Response, which was involved in the research, says Cassie's experience is common.\"A lot of the time victims don't even know they've been a victim of a disability hate crime\" and, as a result, the number of reported incidents could be the \"tip of the iceberg\".She says a disability hate crime is classed as \"any criminal offence that is motivated by a person's disability or perceived disability\".Of those hate crimes that were reported but went no further, Ali says: \"We found that around 50% of the no-charge outcomes were a result of either the victim withdrawing support, evidential difficulties despite there being a named suspect, or that the police were unable to find a suspect.\"She says its \"really important for the victim to capture as much information as possible - what they hear, what they see, or what's happening and the date, the time, the location\".But she adds that the whole community should play its part. \"If you witness a crime you might feel uncomfortable or nervous to go up at the time, but afterwards please support the victim. Give your phone number, give any information that you were able to record at that point in time about what happened.\" The two charities - Leonard Cheshire and United Response - which conducted the research have called for police forces to appoint Disability Liaison Officers.\"They would be able to support a disabled victim from the point of reporting all the way through,\" Ali says, hopefully resulting in a higher charge rate.This week, the Home Office also released its statistics on hate crimes. It reported that 14,242 disability hate crimes had been recorded in the year ending March 2022 - an increase of 43% on the previous year. That figure has doubled since 2017/2018 with stalking and harassment offences the most commonly recorded disability hate crimes.A Home Office spokesperson described hate crime as a \"scourge on communities\" and said that \"while the rise is likely to be largely driven by improvements in police recording, we cannot be complacent.\"They added: \"[We] expect the police to fully investigate these hateful attacks and make sure the cowards who commit them feel the full force of the law.\"After thinking about the incident with the men, Cassie did report it to the police. She received a call from an officer and a case number, but says she never heard from them again, putting Cassie's case in the 99% that result in no charge. The force was unable to corroborate this information. Cassie is getting on with her PhD, but says the \"terrifying\" experiences have stayed with her and she has changed where she shops and which public transport she uses as a result.\"Even now, I get this anxiety - what if something happens?\" she says. .Hate crimes recorded by police rise by 26%United ResponseLeonard Cheshire"

        "text": "On Friday 2 April 1982, Argentina invaded the British overseas territory of the Falkland Islands. It had claimed sovereignty over the islands for many years. The country's ruling military junta did not believe that Britain would attempt to regain the islands by force.The ruling military junta was wrong. Britain, under Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, assembled warships, refitted merchant ships and sent a task force 8,000 miles (12,900 km) across the globe to the South Atlantic.Over the next 10 weeks, 649 Argentine military personnel, 255 British military personnel, and three Falkland Islanders were killed.Forty years on, Tamsin McLeod, an islander who grew up in the shadow of the conflict and now lives in London, tells the BBC what her homeland means to her - and how the island families coped with their peaceful lives being thrust into the arena of war.\"Our nickname is 'Kelper' because of all the seaweed and kelp surrounding the islands, so I'm a Kelper or Falklander first and British second, and on the islands we are so, so eternally grateful for what the British did. I probably wouldn't be here today if that task force had not been sent. \"My parents didn't really talk about it to me much as I grew up.\"It was something that happened, where you have the Liberation Day and the parades and the receptions, and you attend them and everything. And it's very personal. \"But the older I've become the more my parents have opened up about it. My parents would say in passing, 'oh, yeah, your aunt and uncle were locked in the Goose Green town hall for 30 days'.\" During the war more than 100 islanders were held at gunpoint and imprisoned in the community hall at Goose Green. They had been summoned to a meeting there by Argentine officials. They were kept at the hall, in appalling conditions, for nearly a month.In just two months of hostilities in the Falklands, 891 men died, 132 aircraft were lost, and 11 ships were sunk.\"It was always there. It's always in the background. It's the legacy of the conflict - especially with the landmines. It was completely normal to be surrounded by bits of land you couldn't go on, fenced off because there were landmines and if you step on one you could die. \"So going on a walk, it was like, 'oh, yeah, here's wreckage from a helicopter or something from the war'.\"When the invasion happened, my mum was completing her O-levels. Imagine these being interrupted for three months, because you're being occupied and you're being told you have to learn everything in Spanish. \"All of a sudden, you have to drive on the opposite side of the road, you've got a curfew. \"My mum really, really vividly remembers Argentine soldiers turning up at her doorstep because my granddad was the local butcher at the time, and they were like, 'you need to kill mutton and feed us'. \"And my granddad - he was born in England, he vaguely remembers the Second World War, and he did his national service before moving to the islands. And so he's like, 'I'm not putting my family at risk'. So he shipped his whole family out to Horseshoe Bay, which is another farming settlement in the middle of nowhere. \"And that's my mum's main experience of the war - her dad being genuinely fearful.\" Margaret Thatcher addressed the House of Commons on 3 April:\"My dad is slightly older. He turned 18 in April during the conflict, he and his brother were helping feed and cook for the British soldiers. They gave their car, their motorbike, the jeep. People stayed on their floor. They were trying to do as much as they could. \"My dad was a young man at that time and there were people his age dying, soldiers dying.\"You couldn't really escape it. But then in a positive way, you appreciate how lucky you are, how privileged you are. To call yourself a Falkland Islander, to be six generations to grow up here, to have a childhood surrounded by penguins and beaches, to have insanely good fresh air.\"\"The way I grew up, it was 'appreciate what you've got, because we could have really not had this'.\"When I came to the UK, people knew nothing about the Falklands, genuinely nothing. Especially people my age. \"Occasionally some mention penguins - and sometimes you meet a friend's parents in their 40s or 50s and they remember the conflict.\"It's like, 'I remember hearing about it on the radio or seeing it on the television. Wasn't there a war in the 80s? Wasn't Margaret Thatcher involved?'\"That's all they knew.\"\"I grew up there, it's my home. So it was completely normal. I didn't know anything different until I moved away and then went, 'oh, hang on a second, there's a whole wide world here'.\"There's still such a strong, strong feeling. My parents are still really close with lots of veterans. They're genuinely family friends.\"My godmother lost her son on the Sir Galahad. She came to the Falklands to see where he lost his life. And it's terrible, terrible circumstances. I don't think a mother should ever have to do that. And she stayed with my family and returned to the island several times since that original visit. \"And because of that relationship, she became a really important part of my life.\"On 8 June, while preparing to unload soldiers from the Welsh Guards in Port Pleasant, RFA Sir Galahad was attacked by the Argentine Air Force, each carrying three Mk 82 500lb (227kg) bombs. Sir Galahad was hit by two or three bombs, which exploded and started fires. The explosions and subsequent fire caused the deaths of 48 crew and soldiers.\"People should care about the war. People lost their lives. \"We are very resilient. We fight for what we believe in and we really want to continue to fight to be British.\"The island has moved on from the war. We have made the most of the sacrifices lost. We still remember the past and we appreciate everything that's happened. But we're looking to the future now.\"We do not have a positive relationship with Argentina at all. It's not civil at all. \"We are not just statistics and geography - we have heritage, we have history, we have lived experiences that are very valuable to us. \"We're becoming the gateway to Antarctica on that entire side of the world, which is amazing. We're the scientific hub of the South Atlantic. We have more than 60 different nationalities, including a growing population from Zimbabwe due to the de-miners coming and removing the landmines, so we are really cosmopolitan. And we're really proud of that. \"I probably will go back. It's home. It's where my family are. I love going home and visiting them and seeing friends. It's a lot slower. \"That soil is my home. So I carry a piece of it with me wherever I go. My necklace has Falklands sand in it and I promise you, it does not come off.

        "name": "UK farmers call for weedkiller ban over Parkinson\u2019s fears",
        "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-60836892",
        "text": "Some British farmers are calling for a ban on the UK production of toxic weedkiller Paraquat, saying studies suggest it could be a factor in the onset of Parkinson's Disease. It comes as hundreds of US farm workers pursue a legal case against its manufacturer, alleging it knew the risk and failed to warn them.  Andy Pollard was once a farm manager who could leap into his tractor cab. But now his limbs are rigid and his body contorts with spasms. He has advanced Parkinson's Disease, and can no longer control his own movements. He spent decades spraying herbicides on his land and, unaware of any danger, didn't use protective equipment. \"Paraquat was a really good thing to use - or so we thought,\" his wife Sue says. \"Andy would be driving around the fields and the spray would be going everywhere.\"She had thought it was a coincidence that the only people she knew with Parkinson's were farm workers, then read about the potential connection with the chemical.\"Why hasn't it been regulated and stopped?\" she asks. \"We've got a lot of people in the same situation.\"Paraquat was first manufactured in the UK in the early 1960s and is sold globally - 377 companies have registered it for sale.It is one of the world's most popular and effective herbicides, millions of farmers have used it to kill weeds. But it is also one of the most dangerous and has caused thousands of poisoning deaths. Its manufacturer Syngenta says claims of a link between Paraquat and Parkinson's are not supported by scientific evidence, stating it has undergone more than 1,200 safety studies.Andy regularly visits a Dorset farm run by charity Countrymen UK, founded by Julie Plumley after her father John was diagnosed with Parkinson's.The 30-acre working farm sells beef and lamb. In the yard, instead of tractors is a fleet of mobility scooters. \"The farmers come here not because they're ill,\" Julie explains, \"but because they want to get on with living.\"Parkinson's Disease is believed to be the world's fastest-growing neurological condition. It affects neurons in a specific area of the brain called the substantia nigra. It is degenerative, gradually leading to tremors and stiffness in the limbs. Global studies show rural, agricultural areas often have higher rates of the disease.Julie explains her childhood farm was owned by the local council, so her father had to meet certain conditions. \"He had to use chemicals, because if you got too many dock leaves or thistles, they could take money away from you. Paraquat was the pesticide all the farmers used.\"He would carry a backpack filled with the chemical and spend hours hand-spraying the fields. \"He would have his sleeves rolled up, his arms bare, the liquid dripping down.\"John developed the disease in his 40s and always believed there was a connection to the chemicals. His suspicion deepened when his neighbour Ken Barnes was diagnosed around the same time - he was also in his 40s and had also been using Paraquat for years. Ken now visits Julie's farm. He has a twinkle in his eye, but his clarity of speech has gone. \"It's a horrible disease,\" says his wife Sue. \"It's taken his life away.\"She says its manufacture in the UK and export should be stopped. \"I wouldn't want my son, who's got farming qualifications, ending up like his father.\"Paraquat has not been authorised for use in the EU since a court ruling in 2007. That is still the case in the UK after Brexit but it is still made - under the brand name Gramoxone - at Syngenta's plant in Huddersfield. It is exported to countries such as the US, Japan and Australia, with a fifth of exports going to the developing world.In the US, nearly 900 farmers and field workers have joined forces to sue the manufacturer, claiming not only is there a link between Paraquat and Parkinson's, but that Syngenta has deliberately hidden the health risks from the authorities. Syngenta rejects the claims made in the remaining multidistrict litigation case, which is due to come to court later this year.The company's most recent financial statement shows that the company has already paid $187.5m into a settlement fund. But it said the company believes that all of these claims are without merit and the payment is simply to keep the claims from going any further.Toxicologist Prof Jon Heylings worked for Syngenta and its predecessor companies for more than 20 years. After retiring, he turned whistleblower, and has given evidence as an expert witness in the US legal action. He said farmers who used it without protective equipment, damaging their skin, should be worried. \"If they went out the next day and actually used it again, and the next day, you could absorb more Paraquat through the skin, into the blood and then into the brain,\" he says.\"The issue is really does it actually cause Parkinson's when it gets into the brain? That's one of the key issues around the whole exposure. And if this chemical does cause Parkinson's, who is responsible?\" There is no scientific consensus and many conflicting studies on any possible association between Paraquat and Parkinson's.In the UK, research charity Cure Parkinson's said exposure was \"a well-recognised environmental risk factor\" but Parkinson's UK said studies show \"a small increased risk\" at most.In the US, a 17-year-long study found Paraquat contributed to Parkinson's onset and progression. And research by the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences - part of the US Department of Health - found people who used Paraquat developed Parkinson's two-and-a-half times more often than non-users.But the US regulator, the Environmental Protection Agency, says an updated study couldn't replicate those results and no clear link was found.But there are scientists who believe Syngenta is putting profit before product safety and public health.Prof Heylings has a Syngenta regulatory strategy document from 2003 written while Paraquat was still being used by UK farmers. Its author acknowledges a growing number of studies \"citing a correlation between incidence of Parkinson's Disease and herbicide use, including Paraquat\".He explains: \"Syngenta are trying to influence researchers who are working on Paraquat and also influence the direction of the research because the last thing Syngenta wants is a big blow up on Parkinson's. So the strategy was to downplay anything to do with the potential neurotoxicity of Paraquat that could lead to Parkinson's.\" It said: \"In our view, Jon Heylings is technically not qualified to comment on Paraquat and Parkinson's Disease. He is certainly not aware of Syngenta's research on the issue, which was mostly conducted from 2008 onwards, after he left the company. We spent tens of millions of dollars investigating Paraquat and Parkinson's disease - and this figure doesn't include the monetary value of internal expert time.\"In a statement, Syngenta said it had invested hundreds of millions of dollars over the product lifetime to ensure its safety.\"Paraquat has been the subject of more than 1,200 safety studies submitted to, and reviewed by, regulatory authorities around the world. Recent thorough reviews performed by the most advanced and science-based regulatory authorities including the United States and Australia continue to support the view that Paraquat is safe.\"Photos by See the full story on Countryfile on BBC1 at 17:30 BST on 3 April and afterwards on the iPlayer."

        "text": "The first generation who came to post-war Britain from the Indian subcontinent arrived with as little as \u00a33 in their pockets - all the money they could bring in under strict currency controls. Their descendants, in their millions, are part of the make-up of contemporary Britain, but many of their stories are still to be told - and they reveal so much about the process of migration. Mohammed Ajeeb arrived in Britain in 1957 from Pakistan with a battered suitcase. His first home was in Nottingham with 28 other men from Mirpur, in Pakistani-administered Kashmir. He'd had a clerical job in Pakistan but could only find work in a factory. \"I cried at night in my bed,\" he confesses. \"I wanted to go back but I didn't want to be seen as a failure. I thought, 'I'm a determined young man, I want to succeed by hook or crook in this country,' and that carried me.\" Over the years, he fought many battles for equal pay and against racism - but he stayed and went on to become the mayor of Bradford. The 1948 British Nationality Act meant people who came from the former colonies or the empire automatically became British citizens. Britain needed workers to rebuild the country after World War Two. Many who came in the early years from the Indian subcontinent were single, young men. They mostly worked the difficult shifts in the factories, foundries, and textile mills in places like Birmingham, Bradford, and West London. These men thought they were coming for only a few years: they never imagined generations of their family would one day live here. Gnawing loneliness, and missing family, was part of life for these pioneers, the so-called \u00a33 generation. Many wrote to their family on blue aerogram letters. Gunwant Grewal came over from Ludhiana, Punjab in 1965. Life wasn't what she had imagined. She had been a teacher in India, but could only find factory work when she arrived. She lived in a room in Southall, west London, with her husband and daughter in a shared house, a far cry from her spacious home in India. She desperately missed her father who she wrote to regularly.  \"My tears were on my letter as I was writing. My father said, 'Why was your letter damp?' and I said, 'Oh I was having a cup of tea,' when really it was tears. But slowly, slowly it got better.\" One time walking past a bus stop, she saw an elderly Sikh man who reminded her of her father. She spontaneously hugged him. A phone call to hear a loved one's voice was out of the question. Ravi Patel arrived in 1967 with \u00a31, having spent the rest on the journey over to Britain. He recalls that phoning India cost \u00a31.40 per minute, a vast sum then. So Ravi called his family in Ahmedabad, Gujarat, twice a year: once on Diwali and once on his father's birthday. It remained that way until the early 2000s, when communications were revolutionised by companies like Lebara, which was started by three British-Sri Lankan entrepreneurs and offered cheap telephone calling cards. You could now phone the Indian subcontinent for as cheaply as one penny a minute. Decades after Ravi left India, he could now speak to his best friend whenever he wanted.When I started interviewing these pioneers nearly a decade ago, their experiences were not widely documented, but in recent years there has been a growing interest in the stories of people who came from the former empire and made their once colonial ruler home. And the struggles of that generation for equality and against racism are now better known.Each generation has a different attachment to the place left and the place where they now live - but these private, and sometimes delicate, tussles between parents and children are rarely recorded. I have been reporting on the ups and downs of , who came in 1968 as a young bride from Dhaka, East Pakistan, now Bangladesh. Farah was born a year later. Runi's generation often bore and raised their children alone, without the support of their own mothers or any wider family. For the next generation, it was different. In late 2001, Farah was in Liverpool when she called her mother in London to tell her she was about to give birth. Runi says, \"I started to shiver and scream because I'm her mother and I should be near.\" She jumped into the car and drove to Liverpool. She arrived to be told her grandchild had been born. \"That was the happiest moment of my life,\" Runi smiles, \"I am eternal now.\"Waiting in the hospital corridor to see them jogged a memory. She remembered giving birth to Farah and writing a letter to her mother in then East Pakistan, saying she now realised what being a mum meant. Runi recalled lying in the hospital bed with her newborn, in pain, and how she missed her mother who was so far away. She was hungry and wanted to be comforted by her mother's food. So when, decades later, she walked into Farah's room and met her grandson, she remembered that hunger and ache for her own mother. She asked Farah what she wanted to eat. Chicken biryani, she replied. Runi searched Liverpool's halal shops and made that dish for her daughter.Three Pounds in My Pocket Series 5 starts on Friday 8 April at 11:00 BST on . You can hear the previous series Farah, after giving birth to her son, had her own revelation. \"Within seconds of becoming a mum, I had a completely different appreciation of what my mum must have gone through. She didn't have any real extended family around, compared to how supported I felt.\"Five years later, in 2006, Farah had another child and decided to return to London, to be near her mother. She had left the family home in 1988 wanting to get away from the burden of her parents' expectations, with a yearning to live her own life, her way. In deciding to come back to be near her parents, she wanted to give her children something she never had - grandparents. Hers had lived in Bangladesh and she barely saw them. Hearing Farah, I realised that there must be many thousands from the second generation, born in Britain, who grew up orphaned from their grandparents. This relationship between our children and their grandparents - the pioneers - has such a precious meaning for us, as it was something we never had.For Farah, life had come full circle. She wanted her children to be immersed in Bengali food, culture and language - things that were so much a part of her parents' home. It was the same home Farah had wanted to escape in the late 1980s. \"When you're young, you want to fit in, and when you're older, you're just confident - fitting in matters less than the things that made you who you are.\"Testimonies like these are an important part of the story of migration and the story of Britain. What began as an empire ended up with former subjects of the Raj settling as citizens, with generations now living here. Each individual making a choice about what to discard from the place left behind and what to hold on to in Britain.Runi's husband died last year. Her voice breaks as she tells me, \"It feels like you build a house and you start with one brick. I built the whole big house over the years with him. We fought, we argued. But we wanted to build that house, and we did.\"He is buried near their home in London. As a young man, he wanted to rest in Bangladesh's earth, in the family plot there. But later, he realised his home was where his children and grandchildren were. His centre of gravity had shifted. There had been many difficult and lonely times, but now three generations were successfully established in Britain. Runi tells me she has reserved a plot next to his. \"I feel that this is a big tree, solidly rooted into a land, and it cannot be pulled out.\"'How I became a secret daytime DJ'"

        "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-62786001",
        "text": "An outcast from birth, Milton Washington is the child of a Korean woman and a black US soldier, who became a \"slickyboy\", or child thief, and dreamed of making it to America. At the age of eight, he seized his chance. When a beautiful car pulled up one day outside St Vincent's orphanage in South Korea, Milton Washington made a split-second decision that would change the course of his life.A black American couple stepped out. The man was in military uniform, the woman had an Afro and wore a beautiful flowing dress, and when Milton realised that they were going to adopt his friend Joseph - who was black and Korean just like him - he ran to the couple's car, jumped inside and locked all the doors. Crying and screaming for his life, he wasn't getting out unless the man and woman took him home with them too. The couple - Captain and Mrs Washington - agreed to take both Joseph and Milton home, but only to see which of them fitted in best with their family. They would give it a few days, they said, and then make their choice.That night, lying in bed in an unfamiliar bedroom, in an unfamiliar house at the Dongducheon American military base, little Milton made his second big decision of the day - and ran away. \"I didn't want to get taken back to the orphanage - maybe they wouldn't choose me,\" he says.\"I was just trying to get to America.\"Before his life in the orphanage, Milton was the only black child in a small village near the border with North Korea. Milton's father, an American soldier, was long gone, but his mother, who worked hard days in the rice fields, loved him and protected him fiercely against the prejudice they encountered. The children in Milton's South Korean village would sing a song about red apples, bananas, a train - and a monkey. \"I remember the part of the song they sang to me the loudest. The part about the black monkey's butt being red. That set the tone,\" he says. It was just an innocent playground song on the face of it - it wasn't racist, or at least, not designed to be. But they turned it into something hurtful: a way to single him out for the colour of his skin. As the son of a black man, he says, he fell \"outside of the limits\" of what it meant to be Korean in the '60s and '70s. And because his father was not Korean, he had no right to a birth certificate. Milton knew that his father was from the US - in his mind a land of flying cars, where the cities were made of gold, with ice-cream mountains. \"I dreamed of going to America because it was full of black people - these magical creatures,\" Milton says, \"and of being accepted.\"Milton's America was a fantasy land that couldn't have been more different from his reality. He and his mother lived in a mud and stone hut, slept on the floor, and washed their clothes in the river. One morning, village elders arrived at the door and told Milton's mother they would no longer accept \"the shame that you're bringing upon this village because of that boy\". Although Milton's mother argued their case, she and Milton left their home and moved to a nearby town attached to an American military base. There were cars there, electricity, and money, all of which were new to Milton - salt had been the currency in their village. Milton also saw black American soldiers for the first time, and felt a step closer to finding his father.Milton Washington spoke to  on BBC World ServiceIn the alleys of the red-light district below their tiny apartment, homeless boys begged, picked pockets, and fought with other gangs. The American soldiers called them \"slickyboys\" - slang for little thieves. And when six-year-old Milton shared a packet of Oreos with the boys - given to him by his mum's American boyfriend - he became a slickyboy too. Milton finally felt like he belonged. \"All the black soldiers would give me money - dollar bills, not just change,\" he says. \"It completely changed my life.\"Milton's mother had become a sex worker in a club in town and went out at night to work. Milton was left alone in their apartment - under strict instruction not to leave, instructions he routinely ignored. One night Milton's mum didn't return from work as expected - the club had been raided by the police and she and all the other women who worked there were sent to jail for two weeks. Free of his mother's rules, Milton and his friends ran wild, stealing drinks from bars and having adventures all over town. When his mum returned, she made sure Milton was never left alone again. Each time she got wind of a police raid, she would drop Milton at an orphanage for a couple of weeks so that he was safe.Milton remembers being racially abused by the other, mostly Korean, kids at these orphanages, as he had been in the village growing up. But this time, he didn't let it get to him. \"I would almost laugh it off,\" he says. \"'Yeah, I may be these racial slurs that you're talking about - but you're the orphan. I have a mother, she says she's going to be back in two weeks.' And she was always back in two weeks.\" For a while, this routine continued. Then one morning, Milton and his mum took a taxi to a different orphanage, where many of the children looked like Milton. It was an orphanage for children born to American servicemen and Korean mothers, called the St Vincent's home for Amerasian children.Milton's mum assured him she'd be back the following day and promised him a present - he asked for a train set. But when she returned there was no train set, just a hug that he didn't know meant goodbye. \"She told me, 'I need you to be strong,'\" he says. \"That was the last time I saw her.\" It wasn't long after Milton first arrived at St Vincent's orphanage that Captain and Mrs Washington took him to their home on a military base - from where he decided to run away.He didn't get far. He was still small and the compound fences were high, and a search party found him, hours later, sound asleep in a children's playground. But the incident shook the Washingtons, who decided that both Milton and Joseph could stay with them permanently. The boys were adopted in 1977 and eventually moved to America - becoming part of a noisy, loving family of six children, who rode bikes, played sports, and went to school - all the normal childhood things Milton had longed for.But he worried about what had become of his mother and would cry himself to sleep. He was haunted by dreams of wading through paddy fields looking for her. She had always been his \"island of refuge in a very tough world\", he says.Now in his 50s - he's not sure of his exact age - Milton works as a photographer in New York and is writing a memoir called \"Slickyboy\". He's always remained curious about his biological family, and in recent years began to look for connections via DNA websites. In April 2019, he got a hit. It was a family member on his mother's side, who wanted to speak to him immediately. \"Hello, I'm calling from Seattle,\" the voice - with a strong Korean accent - said.\"This is Milton-ah (little Milton),\" he said, using the name his birth mother had often called him. \"I am your sister, Tong, do you remember me?\" Milton did remember meeting Tong - she was one of his older sisters, and they had met a handful of times in Korea when Milton was a little boy. Tong had lived with their grandparents, from whom Milton's mother was estranged.Speaking to his half-sister, Milton says, was \"an incredible moment\".\"I was just really excited [to be] connected with my past, and to have my memories validated by her.\"Milton had not expected his mother to survive, but Tong told him she'd lived a long life, and had died just a few years previously. His mother and sisters had come to the US in 1998, and though they knew that Milton was living there too, Milton's mum had felt she had no right to contact him. But she had left a keepsake for Milton with Tong - a gold and jade necklace to remember her by. \"It's a beautiful piece,\" he says. \"It's a way to carry my mother with me.\" Milton keeps searching for answers about his father. He believes his dad likely came from Louisiana, but has little more information.\"I want to know what kind of man he is. He's the only missing link,\" Milton says. Despite the sadness he still sometimes feels, Milton is certain his mum made the right decision giving him up all those years ago. \"She knew that if I had a shot at an American life, I would do well at it. I love her for that act,\" he says. \"There is a hole in my heart that's always going to be there. But the benefits of my current life versus what it could have been - there's no argument there.\""

        "name": "'Claims I had sexsomnia destroyed my rape case'",
        "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-63116989",
        "text": "Jade McCrossen-Nethercott's rape case was dropped by the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) because of claims she had an episode of a rare sleep condition called \"sexsomnia\". As a result, the CPS no longer believed they could secure a conviction. But Jade challenged the decision and spent months reinvestigating.The CPS now admit they were wrong not to take it to trial and have apologised unreservedly to her. But what went wrong? The BBC followed Jade's case as events unfolded.It was a Sunday evening in the spring of 2017 when Jade woke up on a sofa in south London to discover she was half-naked, with her necklace lying broken on the floor. The 24-year-old, originally from St Ives in Cornwall, had the intense feeling she had been penetrated and thought she had been raped while she slept. Three years later - and just days before the man charged with raping her was due to stand trial - lawyers from the CPS called her to an urgent meeting at a police station.Her case was being dropped. The CPS lawyer explained that two sleep experts had given their opinions on her case. They said it was possible Jade had had an episode of sexsomnia and could have appeared to have been awake and consenting. Sexsomnia is a medically-recognised sleep disorder. People with the condition perform sexual acts in their sleep.This video can not be playedJade was allowed to record the CPS meeting where she was told there would not be a trialA person is deemed not to have consented to sex if they are asleep, according to the law in England and Wales. However, it also states that a person is not guilty of rape if they had \"reasonable belief\" in consent. \"It came completely out of the blue, and it was baffling,\" says Jade, who had never heard of sexsomnia until then.\"I've had two long-term relationships spanning 13 years, and I've never had anything like this.\"\u200b\u200bThe decision by the CPS meant they would close the case and the defendant would be formally acquitted.The first time Jade had been asked about her sleep, was in the police station when she went to give a formal statement.In response to a question from a police officer, she explained that she had always been a deep sleeper and had sleepwalked a couple of times as a teenager. It was a passing comment, forgotten about in the whole gruelling process until her case was dropped.  It had been Jade's best friend Bel who had dialled 999 and started the whole police process. She remembers the sound of Jade's voice on the other end of the line. \"It was like nothing I've ever heard before. She was hysterical and sobbing, and she said 'I think I've been raped.' When your best friend says that to you, it's just earth-shattering.\"The two had been out the evening before at a bar in south London. They had got ready together, drinking prosecco as they did their makeup and headed out arm-in-arm. It was a fun evening, drinking and chatting. When closing time came, Bel ordered a taxi home. Jade decided to go back to a friend's flat with a few people for a last drink.At around 02:00, with people still chatting around her in the living room, she curled up under a blanket in the corner of the sofa, fully-clothed, and fell asleep.At 05:00 she says she woke up to find her trousers and pants were off and her bra was undone. She says she saw a man on the other side of the sofa she was lying on.\"I confronted him saying, 'What's happened? What have you done?' And he said something a bit odd I guess, but he did say 'I thought you were awake.'\"And he just bolted out basically, and left the door open. And I got my phone and started calling Bel\u2026\"Two male police officers arrived and took Jade straight for forensic tests. Vaginal swabs detected semen which would later be matched to the man on the sofa.The suspect offered no comment when initially questioned by police. The CPS made the decision to charge him with rape. He pleaded not guilty. A date was set for trial.But it never went ahead.Jade was determined to prove the CPS were wrong to drop her case, but she had limited time to appeal. She requested all the evidence - including police interviews, toxicology results, witness statements and the sleep experts' reports - and pored over them. She was shocked by what she read - and in particular the weight given to the sleep experts' theories. When unexpected sleepwalking claims turn a rape case on its head, Jade fights back. Filmed over three years, this is the remarkable story of one woman's battle for justice. Will she win?Neither expert had met her in person, but their opinions had been significant enough to close her case. The first expert, who had been instructed by the defence, concluded there was a \"strong possibility\" that Jade had an attack of sexsomnia, saying \"her behaviour would have been of someone actively engaging in sexual activity with eyes open and showing pleasure\". The CPS then hired their own expert in response. He concluded that \"a history of sleepwalking, even once at the age of 16 years, and ongoing sleep talking or any family history, is entirely adequate to establish a predisposition to sexsomnia\".Jade was speechless. \"I don't see how this can be one isolated incident [of sexsomnia], that just so happens to be the time that somebody I would never have consented to have sex with had sex with me,\" she says. Jade decided to pay for her own expert opinion and approached Dr Irshaad Ebrahim at the London Sleep Centre. He also has experience of giving expert opinions in rape cases.Jade's case was the first he had seen where a complainant victim was purported to have sexsomnia. In all the other rape cases he had encountered, it was the defendant claiming to have had an attack of sexsomnia. The BBC carried out extensive research and could not find any other UK rape case where the defence had argued the complainant had sexsomnia. Dr Ebrahim explained there was limited scientific research and no precise way of diagnosing sexsomnia. But he said people he sees with the disorder are typically male and tend to have a history of the sexual behaviour in their sleep.Jade then underwent a sleep test - a polysomnography, which monitors brainwaves, breathing and movement during sleep.This video can not be playedPolice bodycam footage when officers first spoke to JadeThe test indicated that she snores and has mild sleep apnea, a common condition where breathing stops and starts during sleep. Both were, according to Dr Ebrahim, potential trigger factors for sexsomnia, so he could not rule out that she may have had an isolated episode.Jade wanted to know if he could give her a clear idea of what the chances were that sexsomnia had been to blame for what happened. \"That is the billion dollar question,\" said Dr Ebrahim. \"Wanting a definitive, black and white answer - yes it was or no it wasn't - is not going to happen.\"Jade still believed she didn't have sexsomnia - but was frustrated the sleep experts couldn't rule it out. She turned to a lawyer to find out more about how courts treat the disorder as a defence. Barrister Allison Summers KC has defended in rape cases where the man accused has claimed to have sexsomnia.She told Jade that sleep experts are almost never able to say definitively whether someone has the condition - but saying \"it's possible\" could be enough for a jury to reach a not guilty verdict.  \"Do I think, as a result of that, that some guilty people get off or are acquitted? Yes, I do. But I generally come back to the point that I would rather that be the case, than we're convicting people of serious offences that are genuinely not guilty,\" she said.\"The only thing I can say is that you hope the criminal trial process will enable those genuine cases to be pulled out from those less genuine.\"Sexsomnia and other sleepwalking defences should always be robustly challenged in court, according to the CPS guidelines. But Jade's case never made it to court. Armed with her research, she submitted her appeal, known as a victim's right to review.A chief crown prosecutor, independent of the CPS department which made the original decision to close the case, reviewed all the evidence again.He concluded the case should have gone to trial - and that the sleep experts' opinions, and the defendant's account, should have been challenged in court.A jury would have been \"more likely than not\" to convict the defendant, he said - one of the tests a case must meet for the CPS to take it to trial.\"I cannot begin to imagine what you have been through and how you feel. I noted during my review the devastating effect of this case on you,\" he wrote to Jade. \"I apologise unreservedly for this on behalf of the Crown Prosecution Service although I appreciate that is likely to be of little consolation to you.\"If you have been affected by any of the issues raised in this article, For Jade, the acknowledgement that her case should have been put to a jury was bittersweet - because the CPS cannot reopen the case.The defendant was found officially not guilty - and so double jeopardy laws mean he cannot be tried without compelling new evidence. \"There is no hope of any justice for what happened to me,\" says Jade - but she hopes the CPS will learn lessons to prevent others from going through similar ordeals.\"It's just being let down by a system that's there to protect - and they've openly said they messed up,\" she says.In the year to September 2021, just 1.3% of rape cases recorded by police in England and Wales resulted in a suspect being prosecuted, according to Home Office figures.The CPS say they are \"committed to improving every aspect of how life-changing crimes like rape are dealt with and are working closely with the police to transform how they are handled.\"Jade is now suing the CPS for damages."

        "text": "This video can not be playedWATCH: Mona Ali Al-Karim says she and her daughters beg for money to pay for hospital treatmentDisplaced families in Syrian camps are begging for donations on TikTok while the company takes up to 70% of the proceeds, a BBC investigation found.Children are livestreaming on the social media app for hours, pleading for digital gifts with a cash value.The BBC saw streams earning up to $1,000 (\u00a3900) an hour, but found the people in the camps received only a tiny fraction of that.TikTok said it would take prompt action against \"exploitative begging\".The company said this type of content was not allowed on its platform, and it said its commission from digital gifts was significantly less than 70%. But it declined to confirm the exact amount.Earlier this year, TikTok users saw their feeds fill with livestreams of families in Syrian camps, drawing support from some viewers and concerns about scams from others.In the camps in north-west Syria, the BBC found that the trend was being facilitated by so-called \"TikTok middlemen\", who provided families with the phones and equipment to go live.The middlemen said they worked with agencies affiliated to TikTok in China and the Middle East, who gave the families access to TikTok accounts. These agencies are part of TikTok's global strategy to recruit livestreamers and encourage users to spend more time on the app.Since the TikTok algorithm suggests content based on the geographic origin of a user's phone number, the middlemen said they prefer to use British SIM cards. They say people from the UK are the most generous gifters. Mona Ali Al-Karim and her six daughters are among the families who go live on TikTok every day, sitting on the floor of their tent for hours, repeating the few English phrases they know: \"Please like, please share, please gift.\"Mona's husband was killed in an airstrike and she is using the livestreams to raise money for an operation for her daughter Sharifa, who is blind.The gifts they're asking for are virtual, but they cost the viewers real money and can be withdrawn from the app as cash. Livestream viewers send the gifts - ranging from digital roses, costing a few cents, to virtual lions costing around $500 - to reward or tip creators for content.For five months, the BBC followed 30 TikTok accounts broadcasting live from Syrian camps for displaced people and built a computer program to scrape information from them, showing that viewers were often donating digital gifts worth up to $1,000 an hour to each account.Families in the camps said they were receiving only a tiny fraction of these sums, however.With TikTok declining to say how much it takes from gifts, the BBC ran an experiment to track where the money goes.A reporter in Syria contacted one of the TikTok-affiliated agencies saying he was living in the camps. He obtained an account and went live, while BBC staff in London sent TikTok gifts worth $106 from another account.At the end of the livestream, the balance of the Syrian test account was $33. TikTok had taken 69% of the value of the gifts.TikTok influencer and ex-professional rugby player Keith Mason donated \u00a3300 ($330) during one family's livestream and encouraged his nearly one million followers to do the same.When told by the BBC that most of these funds were taken by the social media company, he said it was \"ridiculous\" and \"unfair\" to families in Syria. \"You've got to have some transparency. To me, that's very greedy. It's greed,\" he said.The $33 remaining from the BBC's $106 gift was reduced by a further 10% when it was withdrawn from the local money transfer shop. TikTok middlemen would take 35% of the remainder, leaving a family with just $19.Hamid, one of the TikTok middlemen in the camps, told the BBC he had sold his livestock to pay for a mobile phone, SIM card and wi-fi connection to work with families on TikTok.He now broadcasts with 12 different families, for several hours a day.Hamid said he uses TikTok to help families make a living. He pays them most of the profits, minus his running costs, he said.Like the other middlemen, Hamid said he was supported by \"live agencies\" in China, who work directly with TikTok.\"They help us if we have any problems with the app. They unlock blocked accounts. We give them the name of the page, the profile picture, and they open the account,\" Hamid said.This video can not be playedHamid helps families go on TikTok live. Watch how the BBC investigated TikTok's commission from digital giftsAgencies like these, known as \"livestreaming guilds\" and based all around the world, are contracted by TikTok to help content creators produce more appealing livestreams. TikTok pays them a commission according to the duration of livestreams and the value of gifts received, the agencies told the BBC. The emphasis on duration means TikTokers, including children in the Syrian camps, go live for hours at a time.Marwa Fatafta, from digital rights organisation Access Now, says these livestreams run contrary to TikTok's own policies to \"prevent the harm, endangerment or exploitation\" of minors on the platform.BBC News investigates a new trend on TikTok - hundreds of families in camps for displaced people in Syria, begging for gifts on TikTok livestreams.\"TikTok clearly states that users are not allowed to explicitly solicit gifts, so this is a clear violation of their own terms of services, as well as the rights of these people,\" she said.She acknowledges that people have the right to share their stories online \"to try to seek support and sympathy\", but she says these livestreams \"lack dignity, and are humiliating\".TikTok's rules say you must have 1,000 followers before you can go live, you must not directly solicit for gifts and must \"prevent the harm, endangerment or exploitation\" of minors on the platform.But when the BBC used the in-app system to report 30 accounts featuring children begging, TikTok said there had been no violation of its policies in any of the cases.After the BBC contacted TikTok directly for comment, the company banned all of the accounts.It said in a statement: \"We are deeply concerned by the information and allegations brought to us by the BBC, and have taken prompt and rigorous action. \"This type of content is not allowed on our platform, and we are further strengthening our global policies around exploitative begging.\"TikTok, the world's fastest-growing social media app, has made more than $6.2bn in gross revenue from in-app spending since its launch in 2017, according to analytics company Sensor Tower.The BBC approached several charities working in Syria to support families in the camps as an alternative to making money on TikTok Live.A local charity Takaful Alsham said it would provide basic supplies to the families for the next three months, helping the children find schools and covering their educational expenses.But for many in the camps, there are few options to make money other than begging online. Hundreds of families continue to go live every day, and most of the money donated is still going to TikTok."

        "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-62821117",
        "text": "Imagine if your face had been digitally edited into a porn video without your consent and then shared on the internet. One woman reveals the horror of it happening to her. Scrolling through her Twitter feed one evening, Kate Isaacs stumbled across a disturbing video among her notifications.\"This panic just washed over me,\" Kate says, speaking publicly for the first time about what happened. \"Someone had taken my face, put it on to a porn video, and made it look like it was me.\"Kate had been deepfaked. Someone had used artificial intelligence to digitally manipulate her face onto someone else's - in this case a porn actress.The deepfake video on Twitter - with Kate, who campaigns against non-consensual porn, tagged - had been made using footage from TV interviews she had given while campaigning. It appeared to show her having sex.\"My heart sank. I couldn't think clearly,\" she says. \"I remember just feeling like this video was going to go everywhere - it was horrendous.\"In the past, high-profile celebrities and politicians were the most common targets of deepfakes - the videos weren't always porn, some were made for comedic value. But over the years that's changed - according to cybersecurity company Deeptrace, 96% of all deepfakes are non-consensual porn. Like revenge porn, deepfake pornography is what's known as image-based sexual abuse - an umbrella term which encompasses the taking, making and/or sharing of intimate images without consent.It is already an offence in Scotland to share images or videos that show another person in an intimate situation without their consent. But in other parts of the UK, it's only an offence if it can be proved that such actions were intended to cause the victim distress - a loophole which means video creators often don't face legal consequences.Government plans for a long-awaited UK-wide Online Safety Bill have been under endless revision and repeatedly shelved. The new laws would give the regulator, Ofcom, the power to take action against any website deemed to be enabling harm to UK users, no matter where they are based in the world. Earlier this month, however,  she and her team were now \"working flat out\" to ensure the bill was delivered.Kate, 30, founded the #NotYourPorn campaign in 2019. A year later, her activism contributed to the adult entertainment website, Pornhub, having to  - the majority of its content.Kate therefore assumed that whoever was behind the deepfake of her had been annoyed by her campaigning. She had \"taken away their porn\". But she had no idea who that person was, or who might have seen the video. And while she could see that her face had been overlaid onto footage of a porn actor, the video was convincing enough that she worried others might not spot the deception.\"It was a violation - my identity was used in a way I didn't consent to.\"Underneath the video, people began leaving streams of abusive comments, saying they were going to follow Kate home, rape her, film the attack, and publish the footage on the internet. \"You start thinking about your family,\" she says, holding back tears. \"How would they feel if they saw this content?\"The threat intensified when both Kate's home and work addresses were published below the video - a practice known as doxing. \"I became completely paranoid - 'Who knows my address? Is it someone I know that's done this?'\"I was thinking, 'I'm really in trouble here, this isn't just some people on the internet mouthing off, there's actually a real danger.'\"From her experience supporting others in similar situations, Kate knew exactly what to do if someone becomes a victim - but in that moment she froze.\"I didn't follow any of my own advice,\" she says. \"Kate the campaigner was very strong and didn't show any vulnerability - and then there was me, Kate, who was really scared.\"A colleague reported the video, vicious comments and doxing to Twitter, and they were all taken down from the platform. But once any deepfake has been published and shared online it's difficult to remove it from circulation entirely.\"I just wanted that video off the internet,\" Kate says, \"but there was nothing I could do about it.\"There's a marketplace for deepfakes in online forums. People post requests for videos to be made of their wives, neighbours and co-workers and - unfathomable as it might seem - even their mothers, daughters and cousins.Content creators respond with step-by-step instructions - what source material they'll need, advice on which filming angles work best, and price tags for the work. A deepfake content creator based in south-east England, Gorkem, spoke to the BBC anonymously. He began creating celebrity deepfakes for his own gratification - he says they allow people to \"realise their fantasies in ways that really wasn't [sic] possible before\". Later, Gorkem moved on to deepfaking women he was attracted to, including colleagues at his day job who he barely knew.Harmless images are being turned into hardcore porn and used to harass women. Jess Davies explores the emotional and psychological toll being \"deepfaked\" has on unsuspecting victims.\"One was married, the other in a relationship,\" he says. \"Walking into work after having deepfaked these women - it did feel odd, but I just controlled my nerves. I can act like nothing's wrong - no-one would suspect.\"Realising he could make money from what he refers to as his \"hobby\", Gorkem started taking commissions for custom deepfakes. Gathering footage from women's social media profiles provides him with plenty of source material. He says he even recently deepfaked a woman using a Zoom call recording. \"With a good amount of video, looking straight at the camera, that's good data for me. Then the algorithm can just extrapolate from that and make a good reconstruction of the face on the destination video.\"He accepts \"some women\" could be psychologically harmed by being deepfaked, but seems indifferent about the potential impact of the way he is objectifying them. \"They can just say, 'It's not me - this has been faked.' They should just recognise that and get on with their day.\"From a moral standpoint I don't think there's anything that would stop me,\" he says. \"If I'm going to make money from a commission I would do it, it's a no brainer.\" The standard of deepfakes can vary wildly, and depends both on the expertise of the person who made the video and the sophistication of the technology used. But the man behind the largest deepfake porn website admits it's no longer easy to know for certain whether you're looking at manipulated images or not. His site attracts about 13 million visitors a month and hosts roughly 20,000 videos at any one time. He is based in the US and rarely speaks to the media - but he agreed to talk to the BBC anonymously. Deepfaking \"ordinary\" women is a red line for him, he says, but in his view,  hosting pornographic deepfake videos of celebrities, social media influencers and politicians, is justifiable. \"They're accustomed to negative media, their content is available in the mainstream. They're different to normal citizens,\" he says. \"The way I see it, they are able to deal with it in a different way - they can just brush it off. I don't really feel consent is required - it's a fantasy, it's not real.\"Does he think what he's doing is wrong? Part of him is \"in denial about the impact on women\", he admits - and notably, he reveals that his spouse doesn't know what he does for a living.\"I haven't told my wife. I'm afraid of how it might affect her.\"Until relatively recently, deepfake software wasn't easily available, and the average person wouldn't have had the skills to make them. But now, anyone over the age of 12 can legally download dozens of apps and make convincing deepfakes in a few clicks. For Kate that's worrying and \"really scary\".\"It's not the dark web, it's in the app stores - right in front of our faces.\" She also fears the hoped-for Online Safety Bill won't keep up with technology. Three years ago, when the bill was first drafted, deepfake creation was seen as a professional skill in which someone would need to be trained - not merely download an app. \"We're years down the line and the contents of [the bill] are out of date - there's so much missing,\" she says.  But for creator Gorkem, criminalising deepfaking would change things. \"If I could be traced online I would stop there and probably find another hobby,\" he says.Being deepfaked and doxed had an impact on Kate's health and her ability to trust other people. She believes those behind the attacks weren't only trying to intimidate and humiliate her, but also to silence her. For a time, she stepped back from campaigning, questioning whether she could carry on speaking out about misogyny. But now, she is all the more fired-up. She realised she cared too much to walk away.\"I'm not letting them win.\"Deepfakes can be used to control women, and tech firms - including those who make apps that enable face-swapping - should be encouraged to put safeguards in place, she says.\"Any app should be able to detect sexual content.\" \"If companies have not put money, resources and time into ensuring their app isn't being used as a place to create sexual abuse content, they are being deliberately irresponsible. They are culpable.\"Source: #NotYourPorn Campaign"

        "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/world-63727404",
        "text": "Digital travel scams are a growing \"systemic and global\" problem, according to the World Tourism Organization, a branch of the UN. Dozens of Brazilian women have been finding this out the hard way, after paying for luxury holidays from a man whose Instagram account sparkles with opulent hotels and exotic locations.Last December Maria (not her real name) decided to have a break from the heat of the Australian summer, and to take her family on a skiing holiday to Europe.It was her first trip since the pandemic and she wanted it to be special. So she paid $20,000 to a travel agent, Rafael Bessa, a fellow Brazilian who had been recommended by a friend, and made the long flight north.  To begin with, everything was perfect, but as Maria checked out of the third hotel the manager told her the room had not been paid for. Two further shocks came in quick succession. When Maria contacted Rafael Bessa to ask for help, she noticed he was unable to talk to the hotel manager in French, despite his claim to have attended an exclusive boarding school in the Alps. Then, when the family boarded a train to their next destination, there was a problem with the tickets: he had provided two tickets with the same purchase number, meaning that only one was valid. At the next hotel it was a similar story: Maria had to settle the bill, even though she had paid in full already. Initially she had assumed Rafael Bessa was simply incompetent. \"Then I said, 'No, this is not a mistake, this is on purpose. This is in bad faith.'\"Altogether, Maria says she lost $30,000 on the holiday - $15,000 of the money she had paid in advance, plus an extra $15,000 for just one of the hotels. Maria says that as well as telling her he'd paid for the room, Rafael Bessa said he'd got her a free upgrade - but he hadn't, and the hotel charged the staggering full price for the super de luxe room.  Rafael Bessa's promises of reimbursement came to nothing, Maria says. Although he sent her various \"proofs\" of money transfers, the cash never actually arrived in her account. Then, when she posted about her experiences on social media, she says his lawyer got in touch, offering to reimburse $20,000 as long as she signed a non-disclosure agreement. She refused. The BBC asked Rafael Bessa to comment on Maria's allegations. He replied that there had been an unspecified \"problem\" with the price of one of the hotels, and that the room at this price had not been included in the package. He also sent copies of the train bookings - which, as Maria said, both bore the same purchase number. Another Brazilian woman, Ana Jalenna, booked an Alpine skiing trip and also an Italian summer holiday with Rafael Bessa, after he had organised a \"fantastic\" family holiday for her in Brazil.She paid part of the bill in cash, and the plan was that he would put the rest on her credit card. Some time later, she was surprised to see a payment to British Airways appear on her card account and called him to ask about it. It was the payment for her Italian hotel, he told her. Finding this hard to believe, she emailed the hotel and was told no payment had been made.Ana decided to ask Rafael Bessa for proof that he had at least made the bookings at the ski resort. He gave her two reservation numbers, but the hotel told her they were invalid. \"I lost the money, the dream, the trip. I lost everything,\" she says.She later spoke to other dissatisfied clients of Rafael Bessa's, and noticed a pattern.\"The first trip was fantastic and everything is OK,\" she says. \"And then he does a longer trip, a better trip with expensive hotels, and he does this to people.\"Rafael Bessa insisted to the BBC that he booked the Italian hotel. He said Ana cancelled the skiing trip, and he paid her back the money.But Ana said she didn't cancel it - and wasn't reimbursed.Social media is tempting people to sample the luxury holiday lifestyle, but what happens when it all goes wrong? This is the story of one Brazilian travel agent with a trail of unhappy clients around the world.Maria and Ana were angry and scarred by their experience, but neither suffered financial hardship as a result.For Adriane Trofin, a Brazilian working mother of two who lives in London, the failure of her dream family holiday to Greece this year was more traumatic.She first came across Rafael Bessa on Facebook, captivated by his posts from beautiful locations, and struck up an online friendship. She explained that she couldn't afford that kind of holiday herself, but he replied that there were trips for every budget, and she ended up booking a dream holiday to Greece for 14 people in total - members of her family and a number of friends. They had paid Rafael Bessa in advance for the stay at a four-star Club Med resort, but the cars that should have met them at Athens airport didn't arrive.Adriane messaged Rafael Bessa for help. He reassured her that everything had been booked, and gave her three telephone numbers for the car company, but she couldn't get through on any of them.The group was stranded for hours. Eventually, the airport operations manager for Club Med, David Doepfer, came to their assistance. He quickly established that there was no Club Med booking in Adriane's name. Rafael Bessa had once reserved rooms, he learned, but had not paid for them before the expiry date.David called the travel agent and asked him to book a different hotel in Athens for the group, which he agreed to do. But David says that when he called the new hotel to check Rafael Bessa had stuck to his word he was told the rooms had not been paid for.This video can not be playedAdriane Trofin says her marriage is still badly shakenIn the end Adriane's husband paid for the entire group to stay in another hotel, at a cost of $8,500. \"I spent that week, those seven days, discussing with Rafael day and night on the phone, trying to make him send at least a part of the money. He started to mock me,\" Adriane says. He also harassed other members of the group, she says, convincing some of them that the problem was Adriane's fault and that she owed him money.\"I was in hell. I had never faced a worse situation in my life, I never had anything worse in my life than those seven days in Greece.\"My marriage is still badly shaken by that. For me, it's a lot of money, you see? But it's no longer just about the money.\"She says the experience left her \"emotionally destroyed\".Despite having assured Adriane, as she waited at the airport, that everything would be fine, Rafael Bessa told the BBC he had cancelled the hotel booking because Adriane had failed to pay everything she owed him.But Adriane showed the BBC evidence of money transfers made before the trip covering the full cost of the hotel. She had agreed with Rafael Bessa to pay for three plane tickets in instalments, and was up to date with these payments - which Mr Bessa confirmed in screengrabs of messages he sent to the BBC.The BBC has spoken to 10 other clients of Rafael Bessa. Together with Maria, Ana and Adriane they say they paid him $90,000 for services that were not provided.We also spoke to Brazilian lawyer Victor Penido Machado, who is bringing a case against Rafael Bessa on behalf of nearly 50 clients. They paid a total of $183,000 for hotel bookings and other services that were not delivered, he says.A similar pattern is repeated again and again, the lawyer says. Clients arrive at their destinations, find a hotel has not been paid for, and are unable to get Rafael Bessa to pay them back. Approached by the BBC, Mr Bessa denied the allegations made by his former clients, saying he was \"shocked\".\"I'm really surprised by the amount of errors, 90% of your facts are false,\" he wrote.The UN's World Tourism Organization (UNWTO) says social media is increasingly being used by travel agents to persuade customers to buy a dream holiday - one that they too can look forward to posting on social media.\"Because they are being displayed on social media, tourists may have the perception that these services are more reliable than if they would find them on any regular website,\" says UNWTO legal counsel, Alicia Gomez.At the same time, digital travel scams are on the rise all over the world, Ms Gomez says.\"This has become a global and systemic problem. Many national consumers and authorities are reporting an increase in online scams, and the number may be even higher as the shame and the guilt of tourists that fall for them discourage reporting.\"The UNWTO has developed a code for the protection of tourists, which it says clarifies the responsibilities of social media companies, governments and consumers and describes how governments and private companies can best work together.Seven countries have signed up to the code so far, making it part of their national legislation, while others, including Brazil, are in the process of doing so.Meta, owner of Instagram and Facebook, told the BBC: \"We don't allow fraudulent activity on our platforms and work closely with law enforcement to support investigations and keep scammers out. \"We continue to invest in new technologies and spent approximately $5bn last year alone on safety and security.\" "

        "text": "The cost of dying for those already facing financial pressure is the subject of a new photo exhibition. Terminally-ill patients allowed award-winning photographer Margaret Mitchell to chronicle their final weeks alive.The subjects and their loved ones also recorded their struggles as they navigated money worries and illness. The free exhibition, which has just opened at the University of Glasgow, is the culmination of a four-year study into end-of-life financial pressures. The aim was to allow participants to tell their own story in words and images.Stacey, 39,  lived with a rare hereditary genetic condition called Li-Fraumeni syndrome, which makes a person susceptible to developing cancer. She lived with her partner and her mother in a one-bedroom high-rise flat in Glasgow. Taxi fares for medical treatment were a burden. \"I'm in the health centre for blood Monday, that's \u00a320. Then to get injections Tuesday - \u00a325. Then to see my surgeon on Thursday at the hospital - \u00a320,\" she described. \u202fStacey's partner Joost took unpaid leave from his job to care for Stacey and said they struggled financially. He told BBC Scotland: \"In the last month at home, it was three people in one house and that was crowded. \"Stacey's mum had to sleep in the living room on a couch and we had the bed.\"Stacey died recently.A love for fashion and dress-making allowed Liz to create a haven where she felt comfortable. She knew her own flat was not perfect. Her photographs document the black mould in her bedroom and a leaky ceiling. She knew people might see it as \"cluttered\" but it was home to her.Following a diagnosis of terminal lung cancer, Liz struggled to get support. She was estranged from her family and lived alone. She had a partner but they did not live together as she faced her own health issues. She visited charity, vintage clothes shops and the Mitchell library, partly for warmth but also for conversation. Her religious faith also provided solace. \"I've survived with using the radio. When I can't get to church, I listen to this,\" she explained in handwritten notes. In her final days, faced with reductions in her care package due to staff shortages, she accepted a hospice bed. For army veteran Max, remaining at home for the end of his life was a priority. He had experienced homelessness and struggled with institutions. He wanted to be in his local community with friends and his dog, Lily.\"I prefer being at home. No one wants to be in a hospital. I want to do my own thing,\" he said.His home was unfit for his needs, with four sets of stairs and a bath he could not climb into. He was moved into a hospice by concerned carers but before long Max made \"a great escape\", according to his friends.\"He did a runner from the hospice basically to get back to his dog,\" they recalled. With their help and support from his care team, Max was able to stay at home with Lily until the last week of his life.Having grown up in the city, 64-year-old Margaret attributed her cancer diagnosis to pollution. She had lived on a busy road and worked above a bus station for years.She said: \"We went to school in the peasouper. You were all holding onto each other, it was so thick. You couldn't see anything\".Margaret left home aged 16 and worked throughout her life. Following her diagnosis, her main concern was making sure her teenage daughter was financially taken care of when she was gone.With the help of a hospice social worker, Margaret tried to check which benefits she would be eligible for.  She was upset when she discovered she would not be able to access her pension.\"I've never claimed unemployment benefits, ever. Talking about national insurance stamps, I'm fully booked up. I'm going to lose my old-age pension which I never, ever received\".When 53-year-old Andy arrived at the hospice, he was concerned about naming his estranged family in his admission forms in case they were left burdened with his funeral costs.His diagnosis of throat cancer made it hard for him to communicate. He was very sick and \"simply wanted to die\".Hospice staff were able to help Andy reunite with his family - his daughter and a granddaughter he never knew he had.The photos that Andy contributed to the exhibition show bags of food his daughter brought him in the hospice.Photographer Margaret Mitchell noticed a jar with sticky notes by his bedside. Andy explained that he was writing notes to leave to his granddaughter when he was gone.The Cost of Dying exhibition is the culmination of a four-year University of Glasgow study supported by Marie Curie, called Through their Glasgow hospice, Marie Curie recruited participants to share their stories in the exhibition.The charity's head of research and innovation Dr Emma Carduff said: \"Financial hardship should never be a barrier to accessing compassionate end of life care and a dignified end of life experience. \"The majority of stories and images included in this exhibition feature people supported by Marie Curie and highlight the systemic issues faced by those who live in poverty.\"This exhibition, which is the first of its kind, aims to bring these issues to the fore, challenge assumptions and promote action.\"By 2040, it is estimated that up to 10,000 more people than now, will be dying with end-of-life support needs in Scotland. Researcher Dr Naomi Richards said: \"We worked very intimately and closely with our research participants to try to get a  sense of their lives - things that give them meaning and the struggles they are having because they are experiencing financial hardship and deprivation.\"Participants told of struggles with income as they were unable to work. Common themes were costs of travel for medical care, utility bills as they spent more time at home and worries about funeral costs.  \"The participants were all given cameras and were asked to document through photographs the things that were important to them and the struggles they were having,\" she said. Professional photographer Margaret Mitchell was also asked to create a body of work reflecting their stories and emotions. \"It was a really challenging project but at the same time that's really rewarding because you feel like you're going to perhaps make a form of legacy for them,\" she said. \"When people come along to see it, hopefully it's a way of entering peoples lives and trying to understand the situations that they're in at this time and also some of the issues that are being raised by that.\" The Cost of Dying exhibition runs from 25 April to 5 May, open to visitors from 09:00 to 17:00 and on Saturday from 10:00 to 16:00 at the Advanced Research Centre (ARC) at The University of Glasgow"

What we weren't expecting was to see quite so many tributes to his cat. For this year's theme, the A-list guests were asked to wear outfits which paid homage to the German fashion designer, Lagerfeld served as the creative director of Chanel from 1983 until his death - and many Met Gala attendees chose to wear classic outfits from the French fashion house in his honour.But others preferred to reference the German designer's beloved cat Choupette, who was as synonymous with Lagerfeld's signature look as his sunglasses and white-haired ponytail.Choupette herself sadly did not attend the event, which is the biggest night in the fashion calendar, but sent her apologies \"Many people invited me to walk the red carpet of the Met Gala in tribute to Daddy [Lagerfeld], but we preferred to stay peacefully and cosy at home,\" said the cat.\"We pay tribute to my Daddy every day since his parting and we are very moved to see one more day dedicated to him.\"Here are 17 of the most eye-catching outfits from this year's Met Gala.When your stage name is Doja Cat, and you're asked to pay tribute to a man who loved his cat, your red carpet look really takes care of itself.The US rapper did not disappoint, wearing a gown which featured cat ears, while sporting facial prosthetics to give herself more cat-like features. Her glittering silver dress was designed by Oscar de la Renta and featured a dramatic ruffled train, which she accessorised with some equally dazzling jewellery.We've all experienced one of those awkward moments where you turn up at work and find you're wearing an identical outfit to one of your colleagues. So we sympathise with Irish actor Barry Keoghan and Nigerian singer Burna Boy, who wore strikingly similar chequered blue Burberry outfits to the Met Gala.To be fair, both of them looked brilliant, and we applaud male stars who shun the standard black tuxedo on a red carpet in favour of a splash of colour.The rapper turned up covered in sparkling silver body paint and Swarovski crystals and wearing a matching metallic thong, in one of the most ambitious and unusual outfits of the night.Upon closer inspection, fans spotted that his bejewelled eye mask also featured beaded whiskers - another likely reference to Lagerfeld's cat. To hammer home the point, when Lil Nas X was interviewed by reporters on the red carpet,  and waving his claws.While Ortega wore a bright pink Valentino dress to last year's Met Gala, this time around she went with a distinctly spookier and more gothic vibe.Her dark ensemble fitted the Lagerfeld aesthetic, but also reflected Ortega's starring role in Wednesday, Netflix's hugely successful Addams family spin-off. that playing the character had influenced her personal style. \"I do think that Wednesday changed my taste a lot,\" she said. \"I have a hard time getting her off of me, at least clothing-wise.\"OK, back to the cats.Actor Jared Leto can always be relied upon to deliver some of the craziest looks at the Met Gala - but he really outdid himself this year. The Oscar winner turned up literally dressed as a cat. That's it. There really isn't much more we can say. We're lucky he decided to remove his giant cat head while posing for photographs - or we may never have even known it was him. The hottest rising star in music was making her Met Gala debut this year, so she understandably wanted to remember every moment. Perhaps unaware of the invention of the smartphone, the 23-year-old instead brought her own jewel-encrusted camera to take photos (and complement her custom Balmain outfit). the New York rapper was personally invited to the Met Gala by Anna Wintour, who asked her to attend as a guest of Vogue.The singer and actress looked frankly stunning in her mismatched black-and-white Thom Browne coat, which she later took off to reveal a shuttlecock-shaped sheer dress.\"My first Met Gala was in 2011, and I went with Karl [Lagerfeld]. So this is sort of full circle for us to be honouring him,\" Mon\u00e1e accessorised with a white leather quilted cat bag - yet another reference to Choupette.The outfit which perhaps most explicitly referenced Lagerfeld was worn by actor Jeremy Pope.The Hollywood star lit up the Metropolitan Museum of Art's grand staircase in a huge embroidered Balmain cape emblazoned with the recognisable face of the designer.The 30ft cape featured a hand-drawn illustration of Lagerfeld and  by 70 seamstresses, with more than 5,000m of silk chiffon.Despite being famous for hits such as Lazy, singer David Byrne was possibly the only guest who turned up looking ready to do some exercise.The Scottish-born star brought his bicycle with him - but wisely decided to walk it up the red carpet, which we imagine was a relief to the Met's health and safety team. Byrne wore an all-white outfit - which must have got muddy when he presumably had to cycle home - with some brightly-coloured trainers. You may recognise the monochromatic suit, as it's the same one Byrne wore when he performed the theme song to Everything Everywhere All At Once at the Oscars in March.We've all been there. You attempt to change your bedsheets by yourself, lose track of which corner is which, and end up in a right old tangle.Actress Glenn Close arrived at the Met Gala looking as if she was still trying to figure it all out, so decided to bring her entire bedspread with her.Her flowing gown was, in fact, a custom Erdem dress. \"Like any great fashion designer, he has a passion to create something beautiful and distinctive,\" the actress said of the designer.The Australian actresses both paid tribute to Lagerfeld with their choice of gowns and shared their memories of the designer.Kidman wore a pale pink dress adorned with 3,000 silver crystals created by Lagerfeld for a Chanel No. 5 commercial she starred in.\"I'm very grateful to wear it,\"  \"He was so much a part of my life, as were his whole team. He was the one really sort of shepherded me\u2026 in terms of my love of fashion.\"Robbie, meanwhile, explained she was the last Chanel ambassador to be handpicked by Lagerfeld. She said it was an \"honour\" to wear a 1993 black Chanel gown which Cindy Crawford first wore on a runway.The US theatre producer may not be a household name, but he has consistently served up interesting looks at the Met Gala.This year, Shiaparelli's designer Daniel Roseberry transformed Roth into a human fan for the evening.  Roth explained the outfit was an homage to the signature accessory that Lagerfeld often carried around with him.\"The fan is a form that transforms, has function as well as decoration, and it has inherent movement,\" Roth explained. \"It calls to be to be animated and energised, as an extension of your own body.\"The singer wore a black lace gown, embellished with a floral design by Irish designer Simone Rocha.\"I was inspired by Billie herself, her talent, her world and her powerful femininity,\" Rocha said of creating Eilish's custom look. \"I wanted to celebrate her femininity through fragility and strength.\"The star was accompanied by her brother and musical collaborator Finneas, who went for a more casual outfit, wearing a textured brown trench coat tied at the waist.The British actress wore a strapless white custom Valentino Haute Couture gown, but everyone's attention was firmly on her head.Firstly, because Pugh wore a headpiece that looked like it would come in handy clearing cobwebs from a ceiling.But also because Pugh's appearance confirmed recent rumours she had shaved her hair off for a role in a forthcoming film.\"I've actually had it for about three weeks now,\" she told reporters of her shaved head. \"I thought, what is a better way than to release it at The Met?\"The British singer walked the red carpet with her partner, film director Taika Waititi, wearing a reported $90,000 (\u00a372,000) worth of Buccellati jewellery.It included a pearl bracelet and long diamond extensions which hung off the end of her nails.Waititi wore a gun metal blazer by Prabal Gurung which he wore shirtless and paired with smart white trousers.Kendall Jenner wore a sparkly leotard with long sleeves which efficiently doubled as a train. The whole outfit, including the sparkly towering black boots, was designed by Marc Jacobs.But there was also a reference to Lagerfeld in her outfit - Jenner's high white collar was a nod to those worn by the late fashion designer.Tennis star Serena Williams arrived at the Met Gala with her husband, Alexis Ohanian, and  with her second child.Williams showcased her baby bump in along-sleeved dress with a V-neckline, paired with pearl necklaces. Williams said she was \"so excited when Anna Wintour invited the three of us to the Met Gala\".Hers was not the only pregnancy revealed on the red carpet - model Karlie Kloss also announced she is expecting her second child with husband Joshua Kushner.\"I got a plus one, don't tell anybody,\" Kloss joked in an interview with Vogue on the red carpet. \"You know what, this is also the first time I'm sharing my news, so it's very special.\" Cockroach invades Met Ball... plus more unmissable moments.

        "text": "After spending 10 years as a Buddhist nun in Myanmar, Coral Sunone realised that she needed some fashion help when she returned to the outside world.But with money tight, getting assistance from a professional stylist was simply out of the question. Or was it?Coral, who is based in Malaysia, heard of a website called TimeRepublik, which describes itself as \"a timebank for the internet era\".Time banking is in essence a more sophisticated form of bartering. You don't pay someone in money for a job that they do for you. Instead you give that person time credits that they can then use to get a service without financial payment from someone else.Via the TimeRepublik website, Coral was able to connect with Cherish Cullison, a New York-based professional wardrobe stylist and costume designer.Over Zoom, Cherish was able to help Coral find the modern clothing that best suited her.\"She styled me very well,\" says Coral. \"No money can pay for such a transaction, it is priceless, it is based on trust.\"The two have stayed in touch after they first met on TimeRepublik a few years ago. This has included Coral returning the favour of assistance, and giving Cherish some meditation lessons.Cherish says it is good that \"the expectation of money is out of the way\". \"Instead you really get to the core of things and you discover something, I think, that's greater and sort of priceless.\"TimeRepublik is the brainchild of Swiss co-founders Gabriele Donati and Karim Varini. They launched the first version in Switzerland back in 2012, but international expansion has come in the past couple of years.The website is free to use for members of the public. Users offering a service earn a \"TimeCoin\" credit. This amounts to 15 minutes no matter what job you provide, be it cutting the lawn of a neighbour, or maths tuition via a video call.You simply advertise what you are offering and how long it would take in TimeCoins. \"We wanted to distance ourselves from financial transactions and find something that could create relationships between people,\" says Mr Donati. \"Because we truly believe that only through our relationships, you can gain the trust of another person.\"TimeRepublik is today based in both Lugano, Switzerland and New York, and says it has more than 100,000 users around the world. It makes money by selling the service to companies who then offer it to their staff via their internal websites. The concept of time banking has been around . Mr Donati says that he wanted to bring it to a younger, and more digitally-savvy audience. is a series exploring how technological innovation is set to shape the new emerging economic landscape.Another organisation helping to take time banking online is charity Timebanking UK. This offers assistance and software to help communities and organisations across the UK set up their own time-banking schemes.The platforms allow users to post offers and requests, log hours and leave feedback.Timebanking UK's chief executive Sarah Bird highlights the built-in safeguarding features, such as users being able to flag any problems. \"So if something goes wrong with the local time bank, we can just jump in there and see if we can fix things,\" she says.Ms Bird also explains that while time banking does not replace professional services or government programmes, it can underpin them, and engage people who would not usually do traditional volunteering.She adds that the Department for Work and Pensions allows jobseekers to  towards their time spent looking for paid employment.\"Time banking might be the first step that someone will take from long-term unemployment before they go on to maybe volunteer or on a training course, because it's a method of making that person feel more confident about themselves,\" says Ms Bird.Timebanking UK has also set up similar schemes overseas, in countries including China, Russia, India, South Korea and Thailand.At Cardiff-based Tempo Time Credits, its time-sharing model is a bit different. Instead of participants earning credits that they can redeem from someone else doing a job for them, they get credits that they can redeem at affiliated businesses, such as local gyms, cinemas, food shops and tourist attractions.Rachel Gegeshidze, chief executive of Tempo Time Credits, says its online-based system is a way of attracting and rewarding volunteers. It is used by local authorities across the UK to help develop projects aimed at key community improvements, such as addressing loneliness or tackling poverty.\"It really supports people to do new things and try new experiences... but also, we have programmes to engage tenants in their communities and to improve health and wellbeing,\" she says.The charity's  showed that there were 10,731 active participants and about 1,100 involved organisations. The study also found that 84% of people taking part felt more positive about their future.Back at TimeRepublik, it says it doesn't wish to be seen as a replacement for cash economies, and that instead it was \"built to coexist\" with them.Cherish Cullison says that from her experience \"everyone has been very happy about the exchanges and I've met some really interesting people\"."

        "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/business-65328579",
        "text": "On the windy roof of a Burger King in Malm\u00f6, southern Sweden, Maggad Khalidy points to a large metal box attached to a jungle of pipes and wires.From the outside, it's far from an eye-catching innovation, but Mr Khalidy, who owns the fast food franchise that runs this restaurant, says it has saved the branch the equivalent of around $16,000 (\u00a313,000) a year in heating bills.The box contains a new form of heat exchange equipment called Lepido, developed by a Malm\u00f6 start-up called Enjay. It spotted a gap in the market for recovering energy from kitchen fumes, and using it to heat other areas inside restaurant buildings - helping to cut bills for conventional heating, and reduce emissions in the process.\"We were a bit sceptical in the beginning,\" says Mr Khalidy, whose Burger King franchise in the Malm\u00f6 suburb Bulltofta was selected for Enjay's initial pilot project in 2016. \"But we see the savings, and the return on investment is quite fast as well.\"Enjay is one of a handful of companies that can offer profitable energy recovery from kitchen exhaust.Lepido became commercially available in 2018 and has since been installed in around 25 Burger King franchises across Sweden, Norway and Denmark, as well as school and hotel kitchens across the Nordics and the Benelux region.Enjay's co-founder Nils Lekeberg says that an average-sized restaurant using Lepido can cut its heating bills by up to 90% a year, and reduce its annual carbon footprint by 30 tonnes. In the wake of , Enjay says it is now experiencing a surge in requests from restaurateurs from other parts of Europe, Canada and the US, despite doing little marketing outside the Nordics.Trials have recently started in several UK locations including a Burger King in Welwyn Garden City, Hertfordshire, and branches of the Caribbean restaurant chain Turtle Bay in Salford Quays near Manchester, and Brindleyplace in Birmingham.Matt Manfield, facilities manager for Turtle Bay in the UK, says he was \"blown away\" by the concept, after seeing the results of Enjay's trials in Sweden. \"We were looking at ways in which we could reduce our costs and become more sustainable, and this was at the forefront of what we'd found.\"Heat exchange systems that transfer warmth from one part of a building to another are already common in many industries, but recovering energy from industrial kitchens is challenging, explains Arne Speerfork, a professor specialising in thermodynamics at Hamburg University of Technology.The hot air in kitchens is full of grease and soot particles which \"stick on the surface\" of traditional heat exchange technologies and make it difficult to recover heat.As a result, the hot air produced during cooking processes is usually simply vented straight out of restaurant buildings. Enjay's technology is larger than conventional heat exchangers and is designed so that the grease and soot particles flow past the metal coils inside that transfer energy, instead of sticking to them, says Mr Speerfork.The hot air can then be pumped out over pipes carrying cold water, which then warms up and can be used to heat other parts of a building.\"It can for sure be effective,\" says Mr Speerfork, although he suggests the price of the product is likely to be a challenge for smaller independent restaurant owners.The average cost of buying and installing a Lepido heat exchanger is around $30,000 (\u00a324,000). However, Enjay's Nils Lekeberg argues most businesses should make that money back within a year or two.In Malm\u00f6 city centre, 56-year-old Orestis Georgiadis is heating pork on a rotisserie to make Greek gyros (meat in pita bread, similar to a kebab), at the family restaurant he's been running for 13 years.He is very interested in installing new energy-saving technologies to help cut costs and limit his restaurant's carbon emissions, but says there's \"no way\" he could afford technology like Enjay's without a loan from the bank or support from the Swedish state.As well as heating up his rotisserie, he needs energy to keep his pizza ovens on all day, power an industrial-sized dishwasher, and  store food supplies in his eight freezers and fridges. Paying his heating and electricity bills has been a struggle over the past year, especially since food prices in Sweden are also .Mr Georgiadis has resorted to turning off the heating in the venue's dining room to save money, which left his restaurant \"almost dead\" after 8pm during the winter months. He says things are picking up again due to milder spring temperatures, but he's not convinced he will be able to keep his restaurant open if his outgoings remain so high. \"If we will have these prices for one year, then I don't think I will survive it.\"Mr Speerfork argues that heat recovery from kitchen fumes could become a more competitive and \"solid market\" in future if high energy prices persist. \"The higher the energy prices become, the more interesting it is to invest even in technologies which are more expensive, for heat recovery,\" he says. Currently, Enjay's main competition is a small four-person British company called Dext, based in Barrowford in Lancashire. It has collaborated with Nando's and Sheffield Hallam University to develop a product called a Dirty Air Heat Exchanger, which has a similar function to capture \"wasted\" warmth from kitchen air vents.This has now been installed in 14 of the chain's restaurants and Nando's says it is planning to roll it out to more sites around the UK and Ireland.\"I think the more choice the customer has, the better,\" says Dext's commercial director Neil Bracewell. \"It's going to be a huge market, and heat recovery systems will become the norm. I'm amazed they aren't already. It seems such an obvious solution for an industry that produces so much heat.\"There is also plenty of scope for expanding the use of these types of technologies into other sectors where heat exchange has traditionally been challenging due to polluted air streams, says Mr Speerfork.Lepido's heat exchanger has already been installed in an industrial laundry in the Netherlands, and at Europe's largest pancake factory in Laholm in southern Sweden.\"I think you can feel that people are on a high,\" says Mr Lekeberg.He says in the first three months of this year Enjay had five times the number of enquiries that it had in the same period in 2022, a clear sign that businesses are trying to plan ahead to improve their energy efficiency as high prices continue.\"We have people calling in actively having found our product or seen something in terms of communication [where] they found the information themselves, rather than us pushing it on people,\" says Mr Lekeberg. \"That's a huge difference for a company.\""

        "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-65489803",
        "text": "North Carolina Republican lawmakers have passed a law that would ban abortion after 12 weeks of pregnancy.Republicans hold supermajorities in both chambers of the statehouse, meaning they can override a veto threat from the state's Democratic governor. The move comes as conservatives move to strip away abortion rights after the Supreme Court ended the nationwide right to abortion in June.Near-total abortion bans have been passed by 14 states after the ruling. Currently, abortion is banned in North Carolina after 20 weeks of gestation. The Care for Women, Children and Families Act was passed by the state Senate 29 - 20 along party lines on Thursday, one day after the state House of Representatives passed it along similar party lines. Protesters shouting \"abortion rights now\" were cleared from the Senate chamber by police as the vote was held. The legislation now goes to Governor Roy Cooper, who has vowed to veto \"this extreme ban\". \"This bill has nothing to do with making women safer, and everything to do with banning their reproductive freedom,\" the governor on Thursday.Republicans gained their veto-proof supermajority of both chambers last month after a Democrat who had previously vowed to protect abortion switched her party affiliation to Republican. Congresswoman Tricia Cotham voted in favour of the bill after promising last year to \"continue my strong record of defending the right to choose\".Despite the Republican supermajority, Gov Cooper on Thursday tweeted: \"We only need one Republican in either the House or Senate to help sustain the veto of this dangerous abortion ban\". He appealed to voters to hold lawmakers that campaigned on protecting abortion access accountable.  Speaking to CNN, he said he would work to over the next week to try and gather support to uphold the veto.The new ban contains exceptions in the case of rape and incest through 20 weeks of pregnancy, or in the event of a \"life-limiting anomaly\" through 24 weeks.It also allows doctors to perform an abortion if the pregnancy threatens the life of the mother, and permits medical providers to refuse an abortion \"on moral, ethical, or religious grounds\".It also requires a doctor to examine a woman in person before prescribing abortion-inducing medications and bans people from mailing the drugs to a pregnant person. North Carolina has been a form of safe haven to women in southern states, which have mostly moved to ban the procedure. In the two months after the Supreme Court's ruling, abortion rose by 37% in North Carolina - more than any other state -  according to the Society of Family Planning, a non-profit that advocates for abortion rights and research.The anti-abortion group Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America has praised the North Carolina bill, saying it will \"lessen abortion tourism in the state\".Meanwhile, the Food and Drug Administration's approval of the commonly used abortion pill mifepristone is being challenged in the lower courts.

        "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-65493066",
        "text": "Critics have welcomed Ed Sheeran's subdued new album - (Subtract), which sees him reflect on a challenging year.The album was released on Friday, hours after Sheeran Subtract, which strikes a darker and more introspective tone, was described by the Guardian as \"a noticeably different prospect to previous albums\".Last year,  and  while pregnant.The release of - (Subtract) marks the conclusion of Sheeran's series of albums named after mathematical symbols, following + (Plus), x (Multiply), \u00f7 (Divide) and = (Equals).The singer had long intended for Subtract to be more acoustic and stripped-back than his usual musical style, to reflect its title. However, during the songwriting process, Sheeran abandoned many of the songs he had crafted for the album over many years, in favour of new songs which directly referenced the challenges he faced in his personal life in 2022.\"Most dominant is the feeling that he has had a pretty awful time recently,\"  in a four-star review of the record.\"Sticking for the most part to the acoustic folk-pop he first made his name with, Sheeran really does seem to be working through his emotional tumult in musical form.\"He added: \"There is another quality that shines through here and it makes Sheeran's least poetic moments work in spite of themselves: unpretentiousness. You never doubt that he means what he sings about.\"Subtract sees Sheeran collaborate with The National's Aaron Dessner, the musician who helped shaped Taylor Swift's acclaimed lockdown albums Folklore and Evermore.Like Swift did on those records, Sheeran adopts a muted style on Subtract, with radio hits generally replaced by a more subdued and downtempo sound.\"Under the subtle guidance of Dessner, Sheeran mostly manages to restrain his populist instincts and let songs unfold at a measured pace,\"  awarding the album five stars.\"The result is a fluid, emotional, anxious and atmospheric album of therapeutic self-healing, in which the raw immediacy of Sheeran's feelings takes priority, shaking and warping material in subtle, twisty and deeply personal directions. In the process, Subtract has become something less strategic than originally planned and more interesting for it.\"He added: \"Even at his most downbeat, Sheeran clearly finds music a balm for suffering souls, with the result that an album born of grief and depression is not remotely hard going.\"The album's launch follows the release on Disney+ of The Sum of it All, a docuseries which followed Sheeran as he recorded the album while navigating challenges in his personal life. On Subtract, Sheeran directly references , a music entrepreneur who helped launch his career, as well as , both of which occurred in early 2022.Weeks later, Sheeran faced a court case, , after he was accused of copying elements of his monster 2017 hit Shape of You. Earlier this year, he faced another copyright trial, after Marvin Gaye's estate accused him of plagiarising the soul musician's classic hit Let's Get It On when composing his 2014 single Thinking Out Loud.But on Thursday, a US court ruled Sheeran had not copied Gaye's song. Speaking outside court, the singer said: \"If the jury had decided this matter the other way we might as well say goodbye to the creative freedom of songwriters.\"Friday's release of Subtract had been long-scheduled, but the timing of the court case meant the album came out just hours after the ruling.Its downbeat nature means the album is lighter on potential chart hits than Sheeran's previous albums, but it does feature his single Eyes Closed, which reached number one in April. Dessner's discernible influence on Subtract in his four-star review.\"Dessner decks out the songs in tastefully muted shades, a sound familiar from Folklore's softer moments: understated string arrangements; twinkling, spectral synthesisers; gentle breezes of feedback and reverb-drenched electric guitars, the sound of fingers scraping along the strings as loud as the notes,\" he said.\"It's atmospheric and beautifully done, although it can get monotonous: the full drum kit and distorted guitar that kick in on Curtains are curiously jolting.\"He concluded: \"Subtract is easily his best album. But it's also the first Ed Sheeran album since his debut for which you can't confidently predict eye-watering commercial success.\"However,  awarding the album three stars.\"Most of Subtract is doggedly one-paced, an often drawback of Dessner's mellow production stylings,\" he wrote.\"If it becomes a little samey in places, it could be argued that this is an authentic representation of the mental health issues Sheeran was working through at the time.\"For the most part, Subtract feels like a warm but cautious hug from a sensitive friend - Dessner gives Sheeran space to say what's on his mind without trying to crowd him.\"There was another three-star review  who said: \"It's certainly a departure, of sorts, for the better. \"Lyrically, the album does fall short, but then Sheeran has spent over a decade trading in vague yet universal issues. Heartbroken? Crushing on someone? Drinking with mates? He has you covered. Now he's trying his best to open up.\"\"For the most part, Subtract is testament to the old adage that less is, often, much more.\" Subtract enjoyed \"a sense of coherence that was missing from 2021's Equals\", but only awarded it three stars overall.\"His voice is particularly prominent, with singing filling almost all the acoustic space,\" he wrote. \"The effect is congruent with the disappearance of instrumental intros in the grabby era of streaming, but it's also that of a person wanting to get something off their chest.\"Ed Sheeran co-writer's relief at copyright victoryEd Sheeran wins Thinking Out Loud copyright caseEd Sheeran says wife developed tumour in pregnancy"

It features a knitted tungsten wire mesh that's folded tightly for launch but which will spring out once in orbit to form a large umbrella-like shape.It's through this 3m-wide antenna/reflector that the satellite will image the ground.SSTL and OSS hope their CarbSar pathfinder will put them in a strong position to win future contracts to supply operational spacecraft to the UK government for both civil and military applications.The government is keen to see what the knitted satellites can achieve. Part of the funding has come from the National Security Strategic Investment Fund, which backs promising technologies that might be used for national security and defence. SSTL will build the bulk of CarbSar, including all the internal systems that drive the satellite, and the electronics that make the radar work.OSS will provide its deployable antenna/reflector, a prototype of which is already going through testing at the company's Harwell headquarters.The firm calls the structure a \"wrapped rib\" design. The gold-plated tungsten mesh is attached to a series of carbon-composite rods that can be wound radially against a central hub. The idea is that once released, the strain energy in these rods, or ribs, will naturally want to jump back into their straightened configuration, pulling the mesh into position in the process.Think of the builder's tape measure and how it always wants to snap longways when unrolled. OSS has a big rig at its factory where it practices stowing and deploying the antenna, time and time again. \"You need it to be as simple as possible because the more parts you have the more chance there is for something to go wrong,\" explains company CEO Sean Sutcliffe.\"It's also got to work every time, so you need to make sure it has enough strain energy to know that it's definitely going to come out fully - that it won't stall half way through. But then you also don't want the system to have so much energy that it tears itself apart or damages the satellite,\" he told BBC News.The mesh itself is remarkable - as is the process of manufacturing it.The yarn is almost invisible. Reels of it feed the industrial knitting machine in the factory which is operated by a former fashion lecturer from Denmark.Precision is everything. When the mesh is pulled tight it must conform to exacting standards.\"We've got a laser scanner and we scan the mesh before stowing and after deployment to check it hasn't deviated from the parabolic shape. We're seeking less than a millimetre's deviation,\" said OSS business development director Michael Lawrence.The UK has talked for some years about having a network of radar satellites.The Ministry of Defence has been promised money to procure them.But the sensing technology is very useful also in civil emergency situations, such as monitoring the extent of flooding or finding evidence of landslips and subsidence. Radar guarantees an image every time the satellite passes overhead because its vision is unobstructed by whatever the weather might be doing at the time.SSTL launched a radar satellite of its own in 2018 but it is hoping the CarbSar model will have added appeal. For one thing, it should have much higher resolution, seeing objects less than a metre across."

        "name": "Can Morocco solve Europe\u2019s energy crisis?",
        "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/business-65415529",
        "text": "Morocco has big ambitions to export electricity produced by solar and wind farms to Europe, but should it be prioritising such renewable energy for its home market?\"The resources we have here could be one of the big, big answers to European demand,\" says Moroccan energy entrepreneur Moundir Zniber.Mr Zniber is a passionate man who senses opportunity out of crisis.\"I think Morocco represents the best opportunity to get the European continent away from the dependency it has today on Russian gas,\" he says.Mr Zniber has spent the past 15 years building his company, Gaia Energy, into one of the leaders of a renewable energy revolution in his home country.\"Morocco has truly one of the best solar and wind resources in the world combined,\" he says. \"We don't have oil, we don't have natural gas, but we have a potential that is just amazing.\"The war in Ukraine has catalysed Europe's politicians to increase their efforts to tackle climate change with new sources of clean energy. Morocco hopes to be part of the solution.It is on Europe's doorstep, and has ambitious plans to generate 52% of its electricity from renewable sources by 2030. The hope is that lots of this electricity will be exported via undersea cables to Europe.But at present, the country still has to build many more solar and wind farms. Currently the north African nation of 39 million people depends on imports for and most of that is from fossil fuels.In 2021, some 80.5% of Morocco's electricity production  By contrast, only 12.4% came from wind power, and 4.4% came from solar.However, Morocco is already making some tangible progress to boost its renewable energy generation, thanks to projects such as the huge Noor-Ouarzazate Solar Complex. With the first phase opening back in 2016, this is now the world's largest Such facilities use mirrors to reflect and concentrate sunlight onto central tower \"receivers\". These contain fluid that is heated by the light, creating steam that spins turbines to generate electricity.At Noor-Ouarzazate the mirrors are now spread over 3,000 hectares (11.6 sq miles). The facility was developed by Saudi Arabian firm ACWA Power, with funding also coming from the World Bank and European Investment Bank.Mr Zniber says that private Moroccan firms like his are now planning to export solar and wind-generated electricity to Europe, and green hydrogen - hydrogen that has been created by renewable energy.He adds that Gaia Energy is developing wind and solar schemes that could meet up to 4% of Germany and Italy's electricity needs. \"And in terms of green hydrogen we have six projects our company is developing that could answer 25% of the needs of the EU.\"Meanwhile, British energy start-up Xlinks has plans to build an undersea electricity cable from Morocco to the UK. Its hope is that Moroccan solar and wind power can provide 8% of the UK's electricity requirements by 2030.Increasing the size of Morocco's solar and wind power generation could help bolster economic growth in the country, according to the World Bank. It has provided millions of dollars of funding for the sectors.The benefits include a decoupling from the \"very heavy volatility of the prices of fossil fuels\", according to the World Bank's lead economist for the region, Moez Cherif. In a country with an unemployment rate of 11.2%, Mr Cherif adds that it could create as many as 28,000 much needed new jobs each year. He also says it would allow Morocco to \"position itself as an industrial hub for investments for exports of green industrial products\" such as car manufacturing using renewable energy.Yet the World Bank estimates that it will cost $52bn (\u00a341.6bn) for Morocco to hit its 2030 renewables target, with most of that money having to come from the private sector. The Moroccan government agrees with that.The administration is acutely aware of the potential benefits, and is trying to accelerate the renewable vision first laid out by King Mohammed VI in 2009.Morocco's Minister of Energy Transition and Sustainable Development Leila Benali says some of the slow growth in renewables in the country in recent years has been caused by global factors.\"The world is just coming out from a historic pandemic, total dislocation of supply chains and value chains - also affecting renewable energy, including the way we trade solar panels and wind turbines.\"However, she acknowledges there are also internal hurdles to overcome. Those include \"speeding up and streamlining bureaucracy\", including making sure companies get things such as \"access to land permits relatively fast to ensure that investors get access to the opportunities that they want\".Mrs Benali adds that the government's energy strategy is based on the three pillars of ramping up renewables, increasing efficiency, and more integration into international energy markets. When asked if it makes sense to export green electricity before all of Morocco's own needs are met through renewables, Mrs Benali says that the \"priority\" is for Moroccans to have access to the \"lowest-cost\" green energy.She adds that there is also a need to take advantage of the \"historic opportunity\" to integrate with Europe's energy market, and that such opportunities could be an incentive for the much needed private investment. The World Bank's Moez Cherif believes that Morocco should both increase exports of renewable power, and add more for domestic consumption. \"Ideally you should do both,\" he says.More from the At last November's  in Sharm el-Sheikh, Morocco signed a memorandum of understanding with France, Germany, Portugal and Spain to make it easier to sell power across borders.However, climate change activist Hajar Khalmichi, from the Mediterranean Youth Climate Network, says she wants to see Morocco fulfil all its domestic energy needs from renewables before thinking of exporting any electricity.She also thinks that the ambition of 52% of electricity coming from renewables doesn't go far enough, and that there hasn't been enough discussion about where the rest will come from as Morocco tries to lower its dependency on its gas, oil and coal power stations.Ms Khalmichi adds that she is also concerned that the country is exploring for natural gas off its coastline.The Moroccan government counters that it has similar challenges to other countries that are going big on renewables, and that it needs gas to deal with the fact that the wind doesn't always blow and the sun doesn't always shine.Mr Cherif says \"there may be a role, a transition role for natural gas [in Morocco]\" as the move from fossil fuels to renewables will be a gradual one over the course of decades.Moundir Zniber adds that Morocco needs \"a mix\" of energy sources. \"Renewables are part of the solution on the electric side.\""

        "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/business-65251892",
        "text": "It's my first time drumming along with a robot.I'm sitting across a table from an adorable humanoid robot called the iCub. We each have our own stick and box, and are meant to strike the box with the stick in sync with a light pattern. But of course I'm also watching the robot - and I'm aware that it's watching me.This drumming experiment has been designed to test how the presence of a robot doing the same task affects a human's behaviour.It's one of many experiments of human-robot interaction being carried out by the research group CONTACT (Cognitive Architecture for Collaborative Technologies) at the Italian Institute of Technology in Genoa.Though I'm aware of the lights and the other people in the room, my gaze keeps being drawn to the iCub's heavy white eyelids.For one thing, there's a noticeable noise when the robot blinks every few seconds. And, because this childlike robot has expressive, oversized eyes, its gaze is compelling. This matters because with blinking, as with other aspects of eye gaze, there's more than strictly meets the eye.\"While it is often assumed that blinking is just a reflexive physiological function associated with protective functions and ocular lubrication, it also serves an important role in reciprocal interaction,\" comments Helena Kiilavuori, a psychology researcher at the University of Tampere in Finland.Human blinking conveys attention and emotion. As a means of non-verbal communication, it expresses a number of things we aren't consciously aware of, such as who should take a turn in a conversation.Thus, it's just one of many social signals humans exchange constantly without being aware of them, yet while deriving a great deal of information and comfort from them.So social roboticists have been studying both the physical and psychological properties of human blinking to understand why it might be useful to match it in robots.\"Due to the many important functions of blinking in human behaviour, it could be assumed that having robots blinking their eyes could significantly enhance their perceived human-likeness. This could, in turn, facilitate human-robot interaction,\" says Ms Kiilavuori.Put another way, \"When the robot's blinking well,\u202fpeople feel for your character,\" says David Hanson, who leads Hanson Robotics.Indeed, CONTACT research with 13-year-olds and adults in Italy shows that both groups simply . An unblinking robot can give a person the unpleasant impression of being stared at, points out Alessandra Sciutti, who leads the CONTACT unit.Humans also perceive robots that blink more . And intelligence matters in situations where humans depend on robots to provide information, such as in train stations.Despite the benefits of natural-looking blinking, integrating it into robots (apart from avatars and robots with screen displays for faces) is technically challenging.\"Blinks are one of the subtlest of human movements, so designing mechanisms that can mimic these movements require advanced technology, such as high-precision motors,\" Ms Kiilavuori explains. The roboticists at Engineered Arts, for example, use expensive, aerospace-grade motors as well as designing their own control electronics.  Specifically, says Mr Hanson of Hanson Robotics, \"The speed of the motors moving skin material when blinking is really challenging and making the shape of the eye look natural while blinking is happening is also challenging. As well as reducing friction between artificial eyelids and the eye surface itself.\"Another issue here is a trade-off between the speed and sound of motorised blinking. Francesco Rea, a senior technician at the CONTACT unit, says that in the iCub robot a quieter motor could dampen the sound of a blink. But the slower movement then makes the robot look sleepy or catlike. Very slow blinks also risk a loss of visual information, as the iCub's camera is located behind the eyes. \"In vision, missing two frames is not that big an issue,\" says Mr Rea. \"Missing ten frames starts to be an issue.\"Ms Kiilavuori adds, \"Another challenge is the correct timing and duration of blinks.\" The different functions that blinking performs - such as how a person changes blinking speed while telling a lie - involve different eyelid dynamics as well as different emotional states.\"Any deviation from the natural and appropriate blinking times and duration, in a given context, can make the robot appear odd and disturbing,\" she says.The CONTACT team use a software program that partially randomises the intervals between single and double blinking. After all, blinking fixedly wouldn't look very natural either. Over at Disney Research, roboticists have joined forces with character animators to develop a research prototype for realistic robotic gaze. The aim is to design an expressive system of eye gaze that is easy for animators to control in order to convey subtle emotion.With elements like motion curves of eyelids, \"we can kind of isolate these individual behaviours, which makes it much easier to really concentrate on getting small aspects and small details correct,\" says James Kennedy, a research scientist at Disney Research.They've  of robotic sensing and control of eye gaze. This includes software for processing images taken by a camera in the robot's chest, and generating control signals for movements like opening and closing the eyelids. Mr Kennedy says that the research remains more experimental, and isn't yet being applied in Disney's theme parks. \"The goal here was to really select a single social cue that we were interested in and push it as far as we could in making lifelike believable motion and behaviour\u202fthat we felt would provide a platform for engagement with people.\" The technology would need to be refined in order, for instance, for the eye gaze system to remain believable in .Another general challenge would be getting humanoid robots to begin syncing their blinking patterns to those of humans, as humans do in conversation. These types of challenges remain compelling to some roboticists. And, contrary to exaggerated pop culture depictions of androids that are indistinguishable from humans, blinking is one tiny example of the many complexities that still keep robotic interactions from seeming completely natural.  When trying to replicate a mechanism as tiny and sometimes underappreciated as blinking, \"actually you reveal how complex this mechanism is, and then how much subtle movement there is,\" notes Mr Kennedy. \"And that's where we have this really great opportunity for exploration and invention.\"\u202f "

The Royal Family is no exception, with scones being served every summer at Buckingham Palace., British baker, author and food columnist, has created a scone recipe fit for a king with her Coronation Crown Scones, melding the tastes of King Charles with this classic treat. Talking about developing the dish, Collison said, \"It is truly a great honour to have been tasked with creating a recipe for the upcoming Coronation. I wanted to choose something quintessentially British, that can easily be shared with friends and neighbours \u2013 and something everyone can make using ingredients they might already have in the cupboard!\"The recipe makes 10 scones, so there will be plenty to share (although we don't expect they'll last long), and you can adapt it to suit your tastes should they not match those of the King.\"I've infused my scone dough with Darjeeling tea and honey: supposedly how King Charles takes his afternoon cup of tea, and have used scissors to shape the top of the dough into a crown, so they will really stand out in your Afternoon Tea spread,\" explained Collison. \"You can leave out the tea entirely if it isn't to your taste, and just try out the fun decoration. Make sure you chill the dough for at least an hour, or you'll find the points will droop in the oven (still delicious, but not as regal!).\"---These scones are perfect for celebrating, as they are each shaped into crowns! Garnish with gold leaf or lustre spray if you're feeling luxurious. They are flavoured with King Charles's favourite tea: Darjeeling sweetened with honey.Makes 10 scones160ml milk1 Darjeeling teabag (or 1 tsp loose-leaf tea)15g honey300g self-raising flour75g butter, cold and cubed25g caster sugar1 egg, beatenclotted cream and strawberry jam, to servePlace the teabag (or loose-leaf tea) into a small saucepan and pour over the milk. Heat gently, until the mixture is steaming, then turn off the heat and leave the tea to steep for 30 minutes. Remove the teabag or strain the milk into a small jug, then add the honey and mix well.Preheat the oven to 180C/160C fan and line a baking tray with baking parchment.Place the flour into a large bowl and add the cubes of butter. Rub the butter into the flour using your fingertips until it is well combined and roughly resembles breadcrumbs \u2013 it is okay to be able to see a few small pieces of butter as this will create a flaky texture.\u00a0Stir in the sugar.Gradually pour the infused milk and honey mixture into the centre of the well, stirring using a round bladed knife. A soft, rough dough should form. You may need to add a little more milk to mop up any excess flour. Tip the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead briefly to smooth out the dough and bring it together into a ball.Gently roll the dough out to a thickness of around 3cm and use a 6cm round cutter to punch out circles. Reroll the remaining dough, taking care not to handle the dough too much, and punch out more scones \u2013 you should get 10 in total.Use a pair of scissors to snip small triangles in the top of the dough from the outside in, and press them upwards to form a crown-like ring around the scone. You need to push the scissors slightly into the scone to create a point that stands proud.Chill the scones for 1 hour to firm up (if you skip this, they won't hold their shape). Arrange the scones on a baking tray, then brush the tops and crown points with a little egg wash.Bake for 12-15 minutes, or until risen and golden brown.

        "text": "Saul 'Canelo Alvarez sent thousands of fans in his home city into a frenzy at a spectacular weigh-in at Teatro Degollado in Guadalajara. The Mexican defends his undisputed super-middleweight crown against Briton John Ryder on Saturday.The champion weighed in at exactly the 12st (168lb) limit, with Ryder marginally under at 11.99st (167lb). \"I'm glad to be here with my people,\" 32-year-old Alvarez said. \"I love everybody, I love my fans.\"Ryder, 34, is a huge underdog against a four-weight world champion widely considered the face of boxing. The Londoner said: \"I feel good. It's nice to get all this out of the way. Get back, rehydrated, replenish and get ready to go tomorrow night.\" An official weigh-in - not open to the public or media - was hosted behind closed doors at a nearby hotel earlier on Friday.  Later that afternoon, a ceremonial weigh-in purely for show was, quite fittingly, held at the striking theatre.With a capacity of just 800, only a select number - mainly local schoolchildren - were invited inside the lavish building, with its red and gold walls, classical artwork and murals of Greek mythology gods. \"I'm glad the kids can be motivated by me and look up to me. That's amazing for me. I feel proud of it,\" Alvarez said.  Before both men took to the scales, there was the watering of a tree which will later be planted in Guadalajara, the presentation of a golden olive wreath shaped crown which will be given to the winner and a mariachi band who played some crowd favourites.Less than a dozen Ryder fans, one wearing a gorilla mark in homage to the fighter's nickname, were drowned out by the boisterous Mexican fans. Alvarez wore his trademark silk designer pyjamas and his daughter flew the Mexican flag in the front row as the theatre erupted.The attendance outside, however, was a magnificent sight. Several thousand fans lined up on the plaza. Separated from Alvarez by railings and a huge police presence, they chanted 'Vamos [let's go], Canelo'.Photographers, broadcasters and some fans surrounded the champion's car as he attempted to make a getaway.\"It's madness. My neck has gone from the police escorts taking us through the streets of Guadalajara,\" promoter Eddie Hearn said.\"There's people hanging to get a glimpse of their hero. I've never seen anything like it. The city is going to erupt tomorrow night. \"This is going to be one of the greatest atmospheres you've ever seen in the history of boxing.\"Ryder, who won the WBO interim title against Briton Zach Parker in November, is the mandatory challenger for Alvarez's belt. \"I know he's a good fighter, someone who's wanted this opportunity for a long time,\" Alvarez said. \"He's a dangerous fighter - a southpaw. But I've been in this position many times. I'm ready.\"Despite his accomplishments in the sport, there are some suggestions Alvarez may no longer be in his prime. He moved up to light-heavyweight and was outclassed by champion Dimitry Bivol in May 2022.Despite having won a world title at light-heavyweight, it is not Alvarez's natural fighting weight, and Ryder does not feel his opponent is past his best.\"Not at all,\" he said. \"Bivol is an exceptional talent. I found the step up to 175lb from Canelo a bit odd. Bivol was bigger, younger, fresher.\"In September Alvarez beat rival Gennady Golovkin on points in their trilogy bout, but many expected him to win by stoppage. Following the bout, Alvarez had surgery on his left hand. \"The Golovkin fight was underwhelming - he didn't get the knockout everyone was expecting. But he still beat him convincingly,\" Ryder said. \"But we don't know how Canelo is going to come out, what's left in the tank and if there are any long-lasting issues with his recent wrist surgery.\""

        "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-65493008",
        "text": "The leader of Russia's Wagner mercenary group says he will withdraw his troops from the Ukrainian city of Bakhmut on 10 May because of ammunition shortages.Yevgeny Prigozhin's statement came after he posted a video of him walking among his dead fighters' bodies, blaming top Russian defence officials.\"Tens of thousands\" had been killed and injured there, Prigozhin said.Russia has been trying to capture the eastern city for months, despite its questionable strategic value.Wagner troops have been heavily involved.Earlier this week, US National Security Council spokesman John Kirby - citing newly declassified intelligence - said that  Half of the dead were from the Wagner group.In his statement on Friday, Prigozhin, 61, pinned his decision to withdraw from Bakhmut squarely on the defence ministry, using expletives.\"Shoigu! Gerasimov! Where is the... ammunition?... They came here as volunteers and die for you to fatten yourselves in your mahogany offices.\"Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu and Chief of the General Staff Valery Gerasimov have often been the focus for Prigozhin's anger, amid reports of fierce infighting among different power groups in Russian President Vladimir Putin's entourage.In the statement, Prigozhin said his Wagner's casualties were \"growing in geometrical progression every day\" because of the lack of ammunition.But he stressed that his fighters would stay on their positions until 9 May, when Russia marks Victory Day in World War Two, and would only withdraw from Bakhmut the following day. In the video released earlier, Prigozhin - seen standing in front of his men - said he would \"transfer positions in the settlement of Bakhmut to units of the defence ministry and withdraw the remains of Wagner to logistics camps to lick our wounds\".\"My lads will not suffer useless and unjustified losses in Bakhmut without ammunition,\" he added.One of the videos released by Prigozhin on Friday appears to have been filmed about 2km (1.2 miles) from the centre of Bakhmut. The BBC has matched ground features, including bushes and pylons, with satellite imagery of the location.Prigozhin is a publicity seeker, and his influence has seemingly waned in recent months. He has previously made threats he has not followed through with - subsequently dismissing them as jokes and military humour. Only last week he told a Russian pro-war blogger that Wagner fighters in Bakhmut were down to their last days of supplies of bullets, and needed thousands of rounds of ammunition. The Kremlin has not commented on Prigozhin's latest statements.Meanwhile, Ukraine's military said it was not seeing any decline in the intensity of fighting near Bakhmut.\"For months, Prigozhin has been trying to make outrageous statements in order to draw attention to himself,\" Serhiy Cherevatyi, a spokesman for Ukraine's Eastern Command, has told BBC Ukrainian.  And Ukraine's deputy Defence Minister Hanna Malyar said Russia was desperately trying to seize Bakhmut by 9 May.Prigozhin has emerged as a key player in Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine launched in February 2022, in charge of a private army of mercenaries leading the Russian onslaught.He recruited thousands of convicted criminals from jail for his group - no matter how grave their crimes - as long as they agreed to fight for Wagner in Ukraine.Prigozhin hails from St Petersburg, Russian President Vladimir Putin's home city. The two most likely first met at one of Prigozhin's restaurants in the city. Years later, Prigozhin's catering company Concord was contracted to supply food to the Kremlin, earning him the nickname \"Putin's chef\". The battle for Bakhmut has dragged on for months. Wagner troops and regular Russian forces have fought on the same side, against the Ukrainian military.Ukraine decided to defend the city at all costs in an apparent attempt to focus Russian military resources on one place of relatively little significance.In February, Prigozhin posted another image of his dead troops and blamed army chiefs for their deaths. Although the military denied deliberately starving his Wagner group of shells, at the time they did respond by increasing supplies to the front line.US-based military analyst Rob Lee argues that Wagner's latest complaint of shortages likely reflects Russia's defence ministry rationing ammunition ahead of Ukraine's long anticipated counter-offensive. The ministry has to defend the whole front, but Prigozhin's sole concern lies in taking Bakhmut, he wrote on Twitter. If Wagner did manage to take the city Prigozhin could claim the political credit, Mr Lee added. The mercenary chief has himself predicted that Ukraine's counter-offensive will begin by 15 May, as tanks and artillery will be able to advance in dry weather, after the last spring rain.In a separate move, Prigozhin appears to have hired an army general who was recently dismissed as logistics chief.Col-Gen Mikhail Mizintsev was dubbed the \"butcher of Mariupol\" for his role in last year's bombardment of Ukraine's southern port city, captured by Russian forces a year ago.Prigozhin has pointed out that the general had done his best to help supply mercenaries with ammunition and had co-operated with the group's efforts to recruit convicted prisoners to its ranks.Col-Gen Mizintsev was only put in charge of army logistics last September, shortly after Prigozhin was filmed inside a Russian prison telling inmates they would be freed from jail if they served with his men in Ukraine.This video can not be playedWatch: Leaked video footage of Russia's Wagner group recruiting prisonersWhat is Russia's Wagner Group of mercenaries?Russia troop deaths hit 20,000 in five months - USWagner raises flag in Bakhmut as Ukraine fights on"

        "text": "Qatar's human rights record is under scrutiny as the World Cup takes place in Doha. A lot has been written about the treatment of migrant workers who built the stadiums and hotels, but much less about the foreign maids who work for Qatar's ruling classes. On paper their rights have been strengthened in recent years - but the new rules aren't always followed.I make contact with Gladys (not her real name) late at night, after her employers from the Qatari elite have gone to bed.In a brief online conversation she tells me she works from 8am to 11pm every day. She cleans, helps prepare food and looks after the children. She eats what's left from the family's meals, and says she hasn't had a day off since she started 18 months ago.\"Madam is crazy,\" Gladys, a Filipina woman in her 40s, says about her employer. \"She shouts at me every day.\" Before Qatar won the competition to host the 2022 World Cup, foreign workers were unable to change jobs or leave the country without their employer's permission. It's still like this in most Gulf states.Under scrutiny, Qatar began to introduce reforms, but Amnesty International says these have failed to end a pattern of abuses faced by domestic workers.For example, Gladys's employer has held on to her passport, preventing her from leaving without his consent.But Gladys still feels lucky. At least she has been allowed to keep her phone, she says, unlike some other foreign maids. Also, she is not physically abused. In Qatar, this happens all too often, she says.There is another reason she wants to stay in her current job - she thinks it's unlikely at her age that she will get a better one. She earns 1,500 rials a month (just under \u00a3350) and is able to send it all home to support her family.Joanna Concepcion of Migrante International, a grassroots organisation supporting Filipino overseas workers, says that many keep quiet about bad working conditions because earning money for their families is their overriding priority.But when those in Gulf states do feel confident enough to talk freely, she says, they often mention serious abuse. One woman said her employer would push her head into a toilet basin and deny her food and water when he was angry.By contrast, a maid employed by the ruling royal Al Thani family, says she is treated well - but she has no day off, as all workers now should under the new rules. Smiley and animated, Althea (not her real name) video calls the BBC from the basement of a royal residence. She explains that her employers have given her an iPhone, clothes, jewellery and shoes of a kind she couldn't afford back home in the Philippines.As in Gladys's case, it's the difficulty of earning a living wage at home that has brought her here.As we speak, other Filipino domestic workers, who share a large room in Althea's living quarters, say Hi and join the call.They have their own bedrooms and a shared kitchen. This is important. The maids Althea sees on TikTok and Facebook begging for food, and pleading for someone to rescue them, are not as fortunate.\"I see those videos online all the time, which is why I feel so lucky,\" she says. \"For me, every day feels like a fairy tale.\"Nonetheless, it's hard work in these \"Cinderella palaces\" as she refers to them, with their high ceilings and chandeliers, antiques inlaid with gold, mother-of-pearl table tops, and freshly cut flowers. The day generally begins at 6.30am, when staff prepare breakfast for the family. Althea eats once the family has finished. After clearing away, they clean the rooms and set places for lunch. \"It is light work because there are many of us,\" Althea says.Maids rest in their flats between 3pm and 6pm, then prepare for dinner. Once dinner is over, Althea has finished work, and is free to leave the compound if she wants.The royal family doesn't hold on to her passport. But Althea does work every day, including weekends. She doesn't get the day off that Qatari law is now supposed to guarantee. It's a price she pays for providing her family with vital financial support.Mary Grace Morales, a recruiter in Manila who pairs Filipino staff with VIPs in the Gulf, says working for the palace is an \"enviable\" job.\"The family is generous,\" she says. And, in a comment reflecting the hardships the maids may have faced at home, she adds: \"The girls get fatter while they are in the palace. The family feeds them well.\"But the royals have some very specific requirements, she reveals. \"The girls sent to work for the Qatari royal family are between 24 and 35 and very pretty,\" Ms Morales says.She pauses to look at the screen where I stare back at her from the BBC headquarters in London.\"Prettier than you,\" she says, smiling.She later sends a WhatsApp to apologise, as her children overheard and said she had been rude. I assure her I was not offended - and don't mention that hiring people on the basis of their looks would be illegal in many countries.Joanna Concepcion, of Migrante International, says she hopes Althea's account of working as a royal maid is true, but adds: \"It's unlikely that we can know that for certain while she is still in Qatar and working for such a powerful family.\"Some royal staff have complained after leaving the country. In 2019 three British and American workers - a bodyguard, personal trainer and private tutor - sued the emir's sister, Sheikha al Mayassa bint Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani and her husband, in New York, alleging that they had been made to work long hours without overtime. The couple denied the allegations and settled without any admission of liability.\"Reporting and addressing cases of violence and harassment, lack of occupational safety and health, and lack of decent accommodation can be challenging,\" says International Labour Organization (ILO) regional director for Arab states, Ruba Jaradat.The ILO says it is working with Qatar to implement the new rules guaranteeing a minimum wage, a day off each week, sick leave and overtime payments, although this remains \"a challenge\".Althea, in her royal palace, says she is happy despite the long hours. When she goes to bed she will message one of her siblings or parents in the Philippines. She often feels homesick - a fairytale palace is not home.However, it remains a crucial source of income.\"I could never support my family without this job,\" she says.The BBC asked the Qatari royal family and the Qatari embassy in London to comment, but received no reply.How does Qatar treat foreign workers?'I am very afraid', says Qatari transgender womanFamilies seek answers over Qatar building deaths"

        "text": "As 2020 drew to a close, Carys Mainprize set herself a challenge for the approaching year: to spend the next 12 months living on two tonnes of carbon: an amount equivalent to around .It was not an easy challenge. Mainprize lives in the UK, where the average yearly consumption footprint per person is over four times her goal:  (CO2e), a measure that includes CO2, methane and other greenhouse gases.Mainprize, a communications officer at a climate non-profit, began researching the carbon footprints of everything she could. She wanted to see what it would take \u2013 and indeed if it was possible \u2013 to live in the UK on a personal carbon allowance that's  to avoid the worst impacts of climate change., but putting a very low-carbon life into practice can mean be tricky: it can mean changing several aspects of daily life, particularly for The top 1% of emitters globally each emit an average 101 tCO2e per year, while the bottom 50% emit just 1.4 tCO2 each. Source: Chancel (2022) (Credit: BBC)But experiments like Mainprize's could help to show the rest of us the way ahead on what a sustainable society could really look like \u2013 and the wider-scale changes we need to get there.So what would the world look like if those of us who currently emit far more did manage to reduce our emissions to a safer level?In some ways two tonnes is an arbitrary figure. After some research, Mainprize decided it would be a decently ambitious target to go for. In his book about carbon footprints, , researcher Mike Berners-Lee suggests readers might want to aim for a five tonne lifestyle for now, which he notes would already be \"a big step forward\" for most in the UK.In some higher-emitting countries even this may be difficult \u2013 in the US, Canada and Australia, for example,  sit at 16-17 tonnes of CO2e a year.A  found that by 2030 the global average emissions need to sit at just 2.3 tonnes of CO2 per year to keep global warming below 1.5C (the report didn't cover other greenhouse gases), down from 4.6 tonnes on average globally today.\"What we're showing is that there are currently some global income groups who are far in excess of [the target of 2.3 tonnes],\" says Tim Gore, head of the climate and circular economy programme at the Institute for European Environmental Policy, a sustainability thinktank, and author of the Oxfam report. \"Some, at least 50% of the global population, are currently below that level and will still be below that level by 2030.\"Research shows some personal choices can have a particularly big impact on cutting your carbon footprint. Source: Wynes & Nicholas (2017), (Credit: BBC) from the Hot and Cool Institute, a Berlin-based think tank, estimated that by 2040, per capita lifestyle emissions need to be 1.4 tonnes of CO2e and by 2050, just 0.7 tonnes CO2e.In 2019, when London-based activist Rosalind Readhead decided to try to , she based her challenge on this report. \"That report meant so much to me, because I finally had a scientific foundation on which to do a project such as the one tonne project,\" she says.Readhead rounded the 0.7 tonnes target to one tonne in part as an acknowledgement that it's difficult to live a low-carbon life with our current infrastructure.Such struggles highlight the systemic nature at the heart of the climate problem: it's very hard to live on little carbon if the products, society and infrastructure around you are all high-emitting. In fact, few argue people should be getting to these kinds of levels with individual action alone: much of the products, infrastructure, systems and political decisions which affect all our lives also need to change to reduce emissions.While trying to live on two tonnes of carbon, Mainprize found herself confronted with several examples of this. She lacked power over the insulation in her home, which she rents, and there was no requirement for her landlord to install this. She was also reliant on a car for work and found buying an electric car too expensive.\"It is clear that individuals in their variety of social roles can contribute significantly in emissions reduction,\" says Joyashree Roy, professor of economics at\u00a0Jadavpur University in Kolkata, India. But unless they are supported by the right infrastruture, technology and policy incentives, she says, this cannot achieve its full potential. For example, \"how can an individual walk in a city which does not provide safe, nice walkable paths?\"Still, there can be a false dichotomy in discussions about individual behavioural change versus systems change, says Lewis Akenji, managing director of the Hot or Cool Institute.\"[We need] both individual and systems change,\" says Akenji: government policy, societal preferences and consumer behaviour can all influence each other.According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), with the right policies, infrastructure and technology in place to enable changes to our lifestyles and behaviour, . The IPCC also says the world needs  to keep global warming below 1.5C.In richer countries, this means moving towards a far lower carbon lifestyle for most people. But the changes to get there aren't necessarily painful or even negative. For example, research has shown that .One major change would be to change how we move around. Akenji envisions a combination of public transport alongside micro-mobility systems (such as electric scooters and drones) which make it efficient and effective for people to reach it. Private cars, with their huge emissions and often empty seats, would largely be a thing of the past, he says, and car parks converted to green public spaces where people go to play, relax or do exercise.This high-quality public transport would be electrified and powered by renewable sources, says Gore. It would be complemented by  that get people active \u2013 benefiting wellbeing and health too.Moving to public transport, walking or biking can hugely cut personal carbon emissions, but can be tricky if the right infrastructure isn't yet in place around you (Credit: Alamy)This would entail huge changes to urban planning in many places around the world which are designed for private cars, notes Gore. It could also mean a comeback for local high streets and markets where people could shop on foot or by bicycle. There would also be , he adds, with longer distance travel provided instead by the expansion of high-speed rail and night train services.Housing, meanwhile, is among the lowest hanging fruit for cutting carbon, says Gore, so huge changes would be quickly seen in a drive towards a two-tonne-per-person world, starting with a huge scale-up of energy efficiency renovations in homes. \"We'd save every household money while lowering our emissions, and probably create a lot of jobs for people doing that renovation in the process, and add to the value of people's housing assets,\" says Gore. \"It's a no brainer.\" (IEA) has argued that well targeted public spending to support insulation and other kinds of energy efficiency could go a long way to cutting carbon. In her effort to live on one tonne of carbon a year, Readhead realised that turning on her gas boiler for just 45 minutes ate up her entire daily budget of carbon. When she later installed secondary glazing on her windows, however, she found she hardly had to put the heating on at all.Thinking of hot weather, meanwhile, all new homes would be also redesigned allow good level of comfort in warm places and , says Lucas Chancel, an economist at the Paris School of Economics.Another large-scale change in a two-tonne world would be to our diets \u2013 especially moving to plant-based diets, says Julia Steinberger, professor of ecological economics at the University of Lausanne in Switzerland. \"These are often cheaper as well. They require a bit of experimentation and a learning curve \u2013 cooking based on lentils, beans, tofu and other forms of plant protein, rather than meat or dairy \u2013 but are achievable by all.\" Meat and dairy products would be seen more as a luxury or a special occasion treat rather than something you would eat two or three times a day, says Gore.Moving to a more plant-based diet is one of the biggest ways to cut your personal carbon emissions, but some people find cutting out meat altogether tricky (Credit: Getty Images)A major 2019 report looking at the  aimed to set out the optimal diet for balancing both healthy people and the planet. It recommended meals should consist of around half a plate of fruit vegetables and plenty of legumes and nuts. Vegan and vegetarian diets can help meet these requirements, it said, but some meat and dairy can still be incorporated.Diet is also a particularly personal thing for people. In her two-tonne experiment, Mainprize, already a vegetarian, . In contrast, Readhead found herself struggling to completely abolish meat from her diet, especially through the colder winter months when she did eat the odd meal with lower carbon meats, such as chicken and venison.And then there are our other types of consumption. \"[A low-carbon world] is a world where overall we consume less of 'stuff',\" says Chancel. We might consume more cultural experiences (think festivals, theatre trips or dance classes), but \"in terms of stuff, whatever has a weight, whatever is produced with matter and with energy, we consume less of that\", he says.This is not some plan to get rid of all our electronics and clothes, but it is a world where their production is based on renewable electricity not fossil fuels, where better quality, longer lasting products rule and where we simply buy fewer of them. It also means a far higher focus on repairability and recycling, says Gore \u2013 rather than buying a new phone every year or so.At the 'Library of Things' in Sachsenhausen Library Centre, people can borrow objects they might otherwise need to buy (Credit: Alamy)The European Union has already adopted  which aims  within the legal guarantee and provide people with better options to repair products that are technically repairable, even if they are outside the guarantee. Measures like this can help to start to build a \"repair economy\" by requiring companies to make their products repairable and make manuals and spare parts available at an accessible price, says Gore.While people would still travel for holidays, meanwhile, they would generally become more local, more deliberate, and less consumptive, says Akenji. \"Quite often the things that we consider holidays are more just opportunities for consumption \u2013 and they do not necessarily improve our wellbeing,\" he says. \"What really improves our wellbeing is getting off the work mindset for a bit to recharge, engaging with communities and people that you love, or discovering other things you do not typically do not engage with.\"Work itself may also change in a low-carbon world. Work contracts could look different than todays, with an increasing focus on working from home and . Still, there would be plenty of work to do in a low-carbon world \u2013 one recent report estimated the shift to a green economy.But it wouldn't necessarily mean a lower standard or living or wellbeing for people in richer countries. Research has shown that \"A small amount of energy-emissions matters a lot [to wellbeing] at low levels, at higher levels it no longer does,\" notes Steinberger, who co-authored the research. In some areas of the world, of course, energy use and per capita emissions should rightly increase. The idea that higher emitting, richer countries should lower their emissions to allow for this is often referred to as the need to give them their fair \"\".Rosalind Readhead found herself seeking out 'carbon freebies' \u2013 low-carbon activities she loves to do \u2013 to help her live a low-carbon life (Credit: Rosalind Readhead)In her efforts to live on one tonne of carbon in today's world, Readhead found herself seeking out what she calls \"carbon freebies\": carbon-free activities that she loved to do.\u00a0\"You can meditate, be in nature, just stop doing things and absorb the world, smell flowers, go foraging, art, walking, cycling, gardening,\" she says. \"Listening or playing acoustic music, singing, dancing, all the things we did as kids: these are things that we had a great love of.\"She found that memories of a life before phones and computers started to come back to her. \"Just sitting around with friends chatting,\" she says. \"Just having a lark.\"And did Mainprize and Readhead meet their respective goals? In the end, Mainprize accidentally lost the spreadsheet she was using to track her carbon around month seven, but up until then thinks she was \"just under the monthly average of the total where I should be\". She notes, though, that there were some things she bought \u2013 like an electric blanket \u2013 that she couldn't find the carbon footprint of, so weren't included.Readhead also thinks she managed to reach her one tonne target \u2013 but says she couldn't have gone lower: \"I needed all that carbon.\"Akenji says he feels inspired by people like Readhead and Mainprize who are actually trying out and testing how to live sustainably.\"Although it might be hard for them to come within that threshold, what they're actually doing is informing us on the kind of changes that we need to make, in the future, to make it easier and the default to live a one-tonne life.\"-- "

        "text": "Lewis Hamilton said his Mercedes team \"desperately\" need car upgrades after a difficult Friday practice at the Miami Grand Prix.The seven-time champion was 0.928 seconds slower than Max Verstappen's Red Bull, which set an imposing pace.Hamilton said: \"It's a kick in the guts and it's a little bit difficult to take sometimes.\"Mercedes are due to introduce a major car development at the next race, the Emilia-Romagna Grand Prix on 19-21 May.\"We desperately need those upgrades,\" Hamilton said. \"We have to keep our head down for one more race and hopefully we will start a new path next race.\"Friday started positively for Mercedes, with  at the Hard Rock Stadium on a hot and sunny Florida day.But team principal Toto Wolff gave a hint of what might be to come when he said after the first session: \"The car has some goodness, it is just very tricky to unlock it. When the drivers have confidence, they can go quick. \"It is on a razor's edge. This morning we seemed to be in a sweet spot. I don't think we can extrapolate from this.\"And Wolff's comments turned prophetic in a second session in which Hamilton was seventh fastest and Russell down in 15th, 1.286secs off world champion Verstappen's pace.Hamilton said: \"Same as every weekend - we are a second down. [Miami] is a great place to be but we are not particularly quick and it's a struggle out there. P1 looked quite good but in P2 the true pace came out.\"I am going to stay hopeful that we can get the car in a better place. We had the extreme bouncing last year but it feels like we are racing the same car.\"Russell added: \"Similar thing to last year, when we were quickest on Friday and then knocked out in Q2 on Saturday.\"The car just changed even from the medium [tyre] run in P2. I felt strong, was on a good lap which would have put me in the top four and then put the soft tyres on and the car just wasn't working for me. \"I think we understand a little bit why that is and have time to improve things overnight. Fine margins.\"If we get things right, there is no reason we can't be ahead of Ferrari and Aston Martin.\"At the front, Verstappen set an imposing pace as he headed the Ferraris of Carlos Sainz and Charles Leclerc.The Dutchman was 0.385 seconds quicker than Sainz, with Leclerc just 0.083secs further adrift.Leclerc crashed late in the session during the race-simulation runs, causing a red-flag period and limiting teams' abilities to assess their cars on heavy fuel loads.Red Bull's Sergio Perez was fourth, 0.489secs off his team-mate.The Mexican, who is six points adrift of Verstappen in the championship and said on Thursday that he would have to be \"perfect\" to have a chance of challenging for the title this year, said he \"hadn't had the greatest of Fridays\".\"We have been trying a few things with the mechanical balance and we learned quite a bit,\" Perez said. \"My lap was also pretty bad. I locked up on the final corner so there is quite a bit to come. I am not driving really well today. So if I can improve my driving and get myself a bit more comfortable, it should be fine.\"Verstappen, by contrast, said he had had \"a positive day\".\"Initially it was getting used to the track a bit with the new Tarmac,\" he said. \"It was ramping up a lot through the day but I always felt good in the car and we had a good balance in it so I felt happy.\"Aston Martin's Fernando Alonso was fifth, ahead of McLaren's Lando Norris and Hamilton.Norris said he had had \"one of our best Fridays so far\" but he added that he felt he had done a good lap that had flattered his car's overall competitiveness.Aston Martin's Lance Stroll, Alpine's Esteban Ocon and Williams driver Alex Albon completed the top 10.Leclerc crashed with about eight minutes to go. The rear twitched through the long right-hander at Turn Seven; Leclerc caught the moment but could not stop the car nosing into the barriers.The front-right corner and front wing were damaged but the new floor introduced as an upgrade by Ferrari this weekend appeared unscathed.Drivers had only just begun their race runs at the time, their attempts to gather data already frustrated by heavy traffic on the temporary street circuit around the Miami Dolphins' Hard Rock Stadium.The session did resume after the accident, but the lost time meant all the drivers will go into Saturday with very limited information as to their race pace.And it meant the usual comparisons between the cars on full tanks - which can provide a more accurate analysis of true pace than the one-off headline lap times - were not applicable.In the first session, two drivers damaged their cars, Nico Hulkenberg crashing his Haas at Turn Three and Alpha Tauri's Nyck de Vries spinning and brushing the wall half way around the lap."

The British singer-songwriter had denied stealing elements of the song for his 2014 worldwide hit. Heirs of Gaye's co-writer argued that Sheeran, Warner Music Group and Sony Music Publishing owed them money for copyright infringement. Sheeran had said he would give up his music career if found guilty at the trial in New York.\"If that happens, I'm done, I'm stopping,\" he said when asked about the toll the trial at Manhattan federal court was taking on him. Sheeran stood up and hugged his team after jurors ruled that he \"independently\" created his song.Speaking outside court, Sheeran said he was \"obviously very happy\" with the ruling.\"It looks like I'm not going to have to retire from my day job after all,\" he said. \"But at the same time I am absolutely frustrated that baseless claims like this are allowed to go to court at all.\"If the jury had decided this matter the other way we might as well say goodbye to the creative freedom of songwriters.\"\"I am not and will never allow myself to be a piggy bank for anyone to shake,\" he added.A musicologist for Sheeran's defence told the court that the four-chord sequence in question was used in several songs before Gaye's hit came out in 1973.Kathryn Townsend Griffin, the daughter of Gaye's co-writer Ed Townsend, accused Sheeran of copyright infringement. She walked swiftly past reporters smoking what appeared to be a cigarillo, saying only: \"God is good all the time, all the time God is good.\"During the civil trial Sheeran sang and played parts of Thinking Out Loud on the guitar. He said he wrote the song at home in England with his friend Amy Wadge, and had been inspired by his grandparents and a new romantic relationship he had just begun. Sheeran's lawyer, Ilene Farkas, told the jurors that similarities in the chord progressions and rhythms of the two songs were \"the letters of the alphabet of music.\"\"These are basic musical building blocks that songwriters now and forever must be free to use, or all of us who love music will be poorer for it,\" she said.This video can not be playedHow similar are Ed Sheeran and Marvin Gaye's songs?During the trial, Keisha Rice, who represented the heirs of Townsend, said her clients were not claiming to own basic musical elements but rather \"the way in which these common elements were uniquely combined.\"\"Mr Sheeran is counting on you to be very, very overwhelmed by his commercial success,\" she said, urging jurors to use their \"common sense\" to decide whether the songs are similar.Last year  at the High Court in London over his 2017 Shape of You.

Tearing through the sky will be some 400 tonnes (880,000lbs) of metal, set aglow by its re-entry through the atmosphere. This raging inferno will crash into the ocean, across an area maybe thousands of kilometres in length, signalling the end of one of humanity's greatest projects \u2013 the International Space Station (ISS).The ISS has been orbiting the Earth since construction on it began in 1998. It has hosted  since its first crew arrived in November 2000. \"The space station has been a huge success,\" says Josef Aschbacher, the head of the European Space Agency (Esa), one of the more than a dozen partners in the programme. It has been a boon for international collaboration, not least between the US and Russia, who partnered shortly after the fall of the Soviet Union. \"It is really one of the big international victories,\" says Thomas Zurbuchen, Nasa's former head of science.After orbiting the earth 34,981 times, the  on 11 July 1979. It was expected to break up over the southern tip of Africa and fall into the Indian Ocean. But while the majority of the debris landed in the ocean, it also rained pieces down on sparsely populated parts of southwest Australia across an area . On 7 February 1991, the Soviet space station Salyut 7 made  after spending nine years in orbit. It had been , but high solar activity led to increased atmospheric drag on the space station and sped up its orbital decay.But much of its hardware is decades old, which could eventually see the station become dangerous or even uncontrollable in orbit \u2013 a fate that befell the Soviet Union's Salyut 7 space station in 1985, requiring two cosmonauts to\u00a0. \"We really don\u2019t want to go through that again,\" says Cathy Lewis, a space historian from the National Air and Space Museum in the US.\u00a0To prevent such a catastrophe in space from happening once more, the space station will be deorbited in 2031, bringing it through the atmosphere to safely splash down in the Pacific Ocean. This will be the largest re-entry in history and, in March,\u00a0\u00a0to\u00a0\u00a0of a \"space tug\" that might be needed to perform the task \u2013 a spacecraft that can push the station back into the atmosphere. Kathy Leuders, head of Nasa's human spaceflight programme, later revealed it was estimated the tug vehicle would\u00a0.Working out how exactly to deorbit the station is a mammoth undertaking. Many large objects have burned up in the Earth's atmosphere, most notably\u00a0\u00a0and\u00a0. The ISS represents a whole new problem, however, being more than three times the size of Mir. \"It is a significant challenge,\" says Jonathan McDowell, an astronomer at the Harvard\u2013Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics in the US. \"A 400-tonne object falling out of the sky is not great.\"Beginning as the single Russian-built Zarya module in 1998, the station today is enormous, boasting 16 modules, vast solar panels mounted on a metallic truss, and radiators to expel heat. At 109m (356ft) in length it is the size of a football field, the largest human structure ever assembled in space. \"It's like the pyramids of Giza,\" says Laura Forczyk, a space analyst at the US consulting firm Astralytical. A rotating crew of seven inhabit the station today.The lifetime of the ISS has been extended several times, but it's widely agreed that extending it beyond 2030 would be risky. Other alternatives, such as boosting it to a higher orbit, are inconceivable, according to Nasa, as they would require\u00a0\u00a0to push the station to a safe altitude. Instead, the plan outlined by Nasa\u00a0\u00a0last year is to push the entire station back into the atmosphere.Every 24 hours the International Space Station experiences 16 sunrises and sunsets as it orbits the Earth at around 17,100mph (27,570km/h) (Credit: Nasa/Getty Images)Events will begin in 2026, when the orbit of the ISS will be  under atmospheric drag, dropping from 400km (250 miles) to about 320km (200 miles) in mid-2030. At this point a final crew will be sent to the station, likely ensuring any remaining equipment or items of historical significance that have yet to be removed are done so, also reducing the weight of the station. \"That is still in discussion,\" says Aschbacher.Once the final crew has left, the station's altitude will drop further to 280km (175 miles), deemed the point of no return \u2013 where the station could no longer be boosted back above the drag caused by our planet's thickening atmosphere \u2013 a process that will take several months. Here, Russian Progress spacecraft are earmarked to then give the station a final push back into the planet's atmosphere.Recent problems , however, and the worsening political situation with Russia, has led to Nasa investigating its space tug alternative. \"Nasa is hedging its bets on Russian participation,\" says Wendy Whitman Cobb, a space policy expert from the US Air Force's School of Advanced Air and Space Studies. Russia has even suggested it may pull out of the ISS as early as 2025.Whatever spacecraft is used, after this final push, the station will reach an altitude of 120km (75 miles), where it will hit the Earth's thicker atmosphere at some 29,000km/h (18,000 mph), beginning re-entry in earnest. First, the solar panels will be torn from the structure. \"The headwind will be so much,\" says McDowell. Based on , this might be expected to occur at an altitude of about . Then at around 80km (50 miles) above the Earth's surface, the modules themselves start to be ripped apart from each other before they are set ablaze by the re-entry temperatures of thousands of degrees, causing them to melt and disintegrate. Several .The deorbit of Mir . The ISS, however, is nearly three times as massive as the 140 tonne (300,000lbs) Mir space station, and its re-entry is likely to be even more spectacular. \"Now you have 400 tonnes of flaming chunks flying through the upper atmosphere at orbital speeds,\" says McDowell.Presuming all goes to plan, however, this flaming debris should pose no risk to human life. ()Instead, any of it that survives re-entry will be targeted to fall in , an expanse of the Pacific Ocean between New Zealand and South America often used as a spacecraft graveyard. This area is deemed to be sufficiently far from human habitation to safely dump space equipment. Due to a quirk of ocean currents, it is also relatively devoid of nutrients so supports little marine life.Even so, the debris path of the ISS will be huge and unlike anything seen before, stretching several kilometres wide and possibly up to 6,000km (3,700 miles) long.As such, access to this portion of the Pacific Ocean will need to be restricted during re-entry to avoid any casualties. \"How they're going to manage that with airplanes and shipping remains to be seen,\" says McDowell. Yet for anyone that does witness it, the death of the ISS is likely to be some spectacle. \"If I were Nasa I would fly cameras and sensors and really detail the breakup,\" says McDowell. \"There's definitely science to be done.\" The entire re-entry from the initial breakup of the solar panels to the splashdown in Point Nemo should last just 40 minutes.While an impressive show, there are some who worry the deorbit of the ISS is a waste of materials. The ISS not only contains a lot of valuable equipment but also useful resources, such as the metal in its truss and its solar panels, that has been taken to space at great expense. \"It's a sunk cost,\" says John Klein, a space policy expert at George Washington University in the US. \"Let's reuse what we can.\"Satellites and many other unmanned spacecraft are brought out of orbit in a way that causes them to burn up in the atmosphere but some debris still hits the Earth (Credit: Nasa)In late 2022, a group of companies including CisLunar Industries and Astroscale in the US presented an  to do just that. That could include melting some of the metal in the truss of the station to be re-used to build new structures or vehicles in space, or even detaching entire modules and repurposing them for other space stations. \"We definitely think there's an opportunity here,\" says Gary Calnan, CisLunar's chief executive. \"We want to build a salvage yard in space.\"A Nasa spokesperson said the agency \"welcomes proposals for new and innovative ideas\" but at this time Nasa \"has not called for nor received proposals to repurpose major structural parts of the International Space Station\". Ron Lopez, president of Astroscale US, hopes the agency will reconsider. \"I hope that we have an opportunity to think through all of these options,\" he says.For the time being the plan remains to dispose of the entire ISS into the Pacific Ocean, a dramatic end to a decades-long display of human ingenuity and collaboration in space. If you happen to find yourself drifting across a seemingly uninhabited expanse of the Pacific in 2031, be wary. You might just spy a shower of molten hot debris raining down on Earth from space. \"It's going to be a media extravaganza,\" says McDowell. \"It'll be an irresistible fireworks display.\"-- "

        "text": "When directors are promoting their films, they usually talk about how happy they are to have put their own personal vision on screen. Not so Dexter Fletcher, when he was promoting Ghosted, an Apple TV+ action comedy starring Chris Evans and Ana de Armas. Discussing the film on Alex Zane's , Fletcher mentioned his plans for an opening sequence in which De Armas would drive through the mountains for three minutes. Executives at Apple Studios vetoed the sequence because, they said, if \"something doesn't happen in the first 30 seconds, the data shows that people will turn off\".-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 -\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 -\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Fletcher didn't mind. \"You can't make a film for streaming the same way you make a theatrical [ie, a film intended for a cinema release],\" he insisted. \"You can't. There's different metrics and there's a different approach. There has to be, even for the reason that people can turn off very quickly... What is a cinematic experience for me as a filmmaker... becomes, 'Ok, I've got to adjust to retain my audience'.\"So now we know. Streaming enables our viewing habits to be monitored more closely than ever before, so while traditionally made films still end up on Netflix, Prime Video, Apple TV+ and other streaming services, there is a whole new wave of films being precision engineered according to previously unavailable \"data\" and \"metrics\": shiny, big-budget updates of what were once termed \"direct-to-video\" movies.The most important statistical category, said Fletcher, is \"completion\", meaning the number of viewers who watch a film from start to finish. Apparently, Ghosted hit \"a really high number\" in that category, and so Apple Studios chalked it up as a triumph. But did the data improve the film in any other respect? A  condemned it as \"content dictated by algorithm at its absolute, industry-shaming worst, so carelessly and lifelessly cobbled together that we're inclined to believe it's the first film created entirely by AI\". And this review wasn't unusual. On Rotten Tomatoes, the website that tallies positive and negative reviews, Ghosted scored 28%, a figure that seems all the more pitiful considering the four previous films directed by Fletcher\u00a0\u2013 , Eddie the Eagle, Sunshine on Leith and Wild Bill\u00a0\u2013 all scored between 81 and 100%. Direct-to-streaming movies might keep us on the sofa and away from the remote control, but that doesn't mean they are any good.What it means, in fact, is that they are the screen equivalent of junk food: easy to consume after a hard day's work, but not exactly nourishing. As well as Ghosted, some notorious examples of such eyeball fodder are , a Prime Video rom-com with Jennifer Lopez and Josh Duhamel, and several violent Netflix capers, including Red Notice with Dwayne Johnson, Ryan Reynolds and Gal Gadot, and Murder Mystery and Murder Mystery 2 with Adam Sandler and Jennifer Aniston. In each case, the filmmakers followed the same recipe: take two or three attractive stars who may or may not have any chemistry, put them in a couple of sunny, scenic locations, whether or not those locations make sense in terms of plotting, sprinkle with stunts and explosions, keep the tone light and quippy, and top it all off with a simple, catchy title.None of these vapid, sub-Bond romps would have had audiences flocking to the cinema, but as Fletcher suggests, viewers have different requirements when they're clicking away at home on a Tuesday night. Ghosted and its fellow direct-to-streaming movies provide blandly undemanding escapism that the whole family can agree to sit through. However terribly reviewed they are, they have enough allure to get us asking, \"How bad can it be?\"Two hours later, we might well answer that question with the words: \"Very bad indeed.\" But that doesn't matter. By then we will have reached \"completion\", and in the world of streaming, that's all the data that counts.\u00a0"

        "text": "While some might associate workplace gossip with a toxic office culture, many studies show its benefits: confiding in colleagues can . And though a quick grumble about a bad manager may be harder when employees no longer share an office, our innate need to seek \u2013 and share \u2013 information about others persists in the pandemic era of hybrid work. In fact,  has become a crucial means of connection for many employees in virtual work arrangements.\u201cWe\u2019re the descendants of busybodies,\u201d says Frank McAndrew, professor of psychology at Knox College in Illinois, US. \u201cIt was in our ancestors\u2019 interests to know what everyone else was doing in order to be socially successful \u2013 to find out who they could and couldn\u2019t trust.\u201dHowever, the current reality of hybrid work has made the normal channels of office gossip \u2013 watercooler whispers and desk-side chats \u2013 more difficult. A new era of workplace surveillance and digital communication has raised the stakes around venting about a boss or other colleagues. More than ever, workers now run the risk of having their complaints suspicious, something most people would like to avoid amid the current rounds of layoffs.\u201cAs soon as technology is involved, the risk of gossiping is amplified,\u201d says McAndrew. \u201cMore bad things can happen more quickly.\u201dEven in light of these concerns, many employees will continue sharing information and opinions to socialize and stay up to date on office politics with their colleagues.Hybrid work has made the normal channels of office gossip \u2013 watercooler whispers and desk-side chats \u2013 more difficult.\u201cIt\u2019s the grapevine effect,\u201d explains Ronald Placone, associate teaching professor of business-management communication at Carnegie Mellon University\u2019s Tepper School of Business, in Pittsburgh, US. \u201cIn most organisations, the demand for information is greater than supply: if there\u2019s talk of impending layoffs but leadership remains silent, you can expect gossip to fill the void.\u201dBut with more employees practising flexible working arrangements, there are fewer opportunities to gossip \u2013 at least via traditional means. \u201cNot only are people less likely to be physically working together, but there is also less to observe when you\u2019re working remotely from your laptop,\u201d says Placone. \u201cWorkplace gossip would be prompted by sitting at the desk and seeing a colleague unexpectedly go into the boss\u2019s office: \u2018Are they in trouble?\u2019, \u2018Are they going for a promotion?\u2019. That source of gossip is largely gone.\u201dDespite this suppressed flow of information, many workers still feel the need to keep one another in the know. In doing so, they often turn to the same tools they use for their job. \u201cThe opportunities to gossip are often on Zoom and Slack,\u201d says Elena Martinescu, a research associate at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam. \u201cPeople may no longer work in the same space as each other, but they still have an ingrained need to share thoughts and observations, and seek information.\u201d\u00a0But the same workplace tools that employees use to gossip can also be tracked by employers. More bosses are also surveilling workers through dedicated software: according to consulting firm Gartner,  within the next two years. Sometimes branded , this technology can log keystrokes, capture screenshots or covertly activate employees\u2019 webcams.It means workplace gossip is not only more complicated in virtual-work settings \u2013 it\u2019s riskier. \u201cCompared to face-to-face conversations, in which tone of voice and non-verbal signals can emphasise sensitive information that shouldn\u2019t be shared, digital communications have fewer nuances,\u201d says McAndrew. \u201cA message can be easily forwarded, misinterpreted and seen by unintended audiences.\u201dAnd although a worker may not lose their job for speaking badly of their employer, a disparaging message history might have serious implications down the road. \u201cCompared to face-to-face gossip, there\u2019s a paper trail \u2013 making it easier for the employer to trace, and harder for the employee to deny,\u201d says McAndrew. \u201cI suspect that firing isn\u2019t out of the question, but it would have to be a very serious infraction.\u201dIn response, anonymous workplace forums, such as  and on , are flourishing as digital gathering spaces to dish about work. \u201cAlthough you may not have an annoying boss in the same space as you, you\u2019re still going to experience the same frustrations, anger and anxiety about your job,\u201d says Martinescu. \u201cGoing online, and broadcasting your annoyances via a pseudonym, could be the new way of gossiping about work.\u201dEven in largely hybrid and virtual office environments, many workers will continue to find a way to gossip. \u201cWe have an innate desire for information that won't go away,\u201d says McAndrew. \u201cAnd some people enjoy gossiping: they have a reputation for knowing what\u2019s going on at the company, while being discreet and responsible handling sensitive information \u2013 they\u2019re often quite popular.\u201d\u00a0"

        "text": "On an unassuming corner in Kingston upon Thames, an unassuming town on the River Thames, is a stone. It's no ordinary stone. Protected by a ring of blue iron rails designed to mimic a crown, with seven pillars representing the seven kings whose names are engraved at the base of the stone, this designated historical monument is, according to legend, England's very own .Kingston, as the town is known, is the administrative centre of the eponymous London borough. Its proximity to the famed , Henry VIII's most famous residence, and favourite filming location for many period dramas such as Bridgerton, makes it a popular transport hub for tourists, though many don't realise the extraordinary events that took place here.That's because Kingston upon Thames is no ordinary London borough. This ancient market town was named the first official Royal Borough of England and is one of the only three royal boroughs in London due to its strong noble heritage.The town's Coronation Stone is especially relevant right now, too. With King Charles III's upcoming crowning, there was  over whether Scotland should transport the Stone of Destiny, the ceremonial coronation stone that is used to crown all British monarchs, to Westminster Abbey this week due to a protest over Scotland being denied another referendum for independence. While , few people know England has its own Coronation Stone right here, in Kingston.Kingston's Coronation Stone is believed to have been used in the coronation of seven Anglo-Saxon kings (Credit: Amy McPherson)Kingston upon Thames' importance stretches back to the 10th Century when King Athelstan, the most notable Saxon king, was crowned here in 925 CE. Athelstan is regarded as the first King of England, having defeated the Vikings and Scotland alliance at York in the Battle of Brunanburh, unifying a map of the British Isles and marking Kingston as the place where a united England began.Kingston upon Thames was officially granted royal status in 1927. London's other royal boroughs are Kensington and Chelsea, granted in 1965 for its long-standing royal links; and Greenwich, which was granted in 2012 as part of Queen Elizabeth II's Diamond Jubilee.Athelstan's coronation is thought to have taken place at what is now the site of the current All Saints Church. The location was likely chosen due to its proximity to the border of the ancient kingdoms of Wessex and Mercia, which Athelstan also united as part of his reign. Although no written record of the stone existed until the 1790s, it's thought that as part of the ceremony Athelstan sat on the Coronation Stone while receiving his crown. A replica of this first crown is on display in the church, constructed from an illustration of the ceremony on 4 September 925.\"So, not only do we have the Coronation Stone, it is possible that it was the act of the first-ever documented coronation in England,\" said Julian McCarthy, a volunteer tour guide in Kingston upon Thames.Kingston remained the favoured site for royal coronations, seeing the crowning of Edred in 946 and Ethelred the Unready in 979, among others; and traditional stories tell that the kings all sat on the same Coronation Stone. Since no further records on the Coronation Stone exist, it is uncertain when and why the stone stopped being used. Yet, one tradition from Kingston has remained: the coronation \"\" (meaning \"order\" in Latin), compiled for Athelstan by Athelm (then Archbishop of Canterbury) is still used for coronations of British monarchs, including the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II in 1953, and will likely be used in the upcoming coronation of King Charles III.A replica of Athelstan's crown is on display in Kingston's All Saints Church (Credit: Amy McPherson)Walking around Kingston on  reveals the borough's historical royal patronage. Statues of past kings and queens adorn the ancient buildings at the Market Square, and although more than a millennium has passed since the coronations of the Saxon kings at Kingston, the stone remains on display outside the town's Guildhall as an important symbol of the town's past.Strolling over Kingston Bridge offers more stories from the past. Kingston Bridge was once the second place to cross the Thames after London Bridge, and many would have to come this way to access the other side of the river \u2013 including any rebels who wanted to overthrow the crown, as Sir Thomas Wyatt the Younger did during the  in 1554. The residents of Kingston attempted to break the original wooden bridge to stop the rebels from reaching the Tower of London. For this loyalty, Queen Mary Tudor gave Kingston a Royal Charter to hold additional market days.With these deeply rooted royal links, and with Kingston already being known as an unofficial royal borough since the Middle Ages, King George V formally named Kingston a royal borough in 1927. In 1965, Queen Elizabeth ll granted another Royal Charter confirming Kingston's title as \"Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames\".A mural depicts the crowning of kings as well as the River Thames, which played an important role in Kingston\u2019s history (Credit: Amy McPherson)\"We are extremely proud to be the oldest royal borough in the country, the place not only where the first Saxon kings were crowned, but home to the Coronation Stone, which is said to be the site of the coronation of seven Anglo-Saxon kings and the place where England began,\" said Councillor Nicola Nardelli, deputy mayor of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames, at a recent ceremony.To celebrate the Coronation, Kingston upon Thames is holding a  on 7 May at the ancient market place, beginning with the parade of King Athelstan's crown replica, followed by a community band showcasing Kingston's journey from the past to the present day.Nardelli added: \"With our strong connection to Britain's royal history, we are looking forward to coming together with our communities next month to celebrate the King's Coronation, where Kingston's community spirit will undoubtedly be at the heart of celebrations.\""

        "text": "It is now only days until the Coronation of King Charles III, and the outfit he will be wearing has finally been announced. The King will be dressed in , including a shimmering gold-sleeved coat called the Supertunica for the crowning. The robe was made for George V in 1911, and has been worn in every coronation since, including that of Elizabeth II. On top of the Supertunica will be a floor-length cloak named the Imperial Mantle, or Robe Royal, which was made for George IV in 1821.-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 -\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 -\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Given the lavish nature of such garments, it is perhaps unsurprising that it has been tradition for recent monarchs to reuse them, although they have usually had a new coronation sword belt and glove made. However, King Charles has decided to re-use the belt and glove made for his grandfather, George VI. It may seem a relatively small gesture, given the opulence of every other garment, yet in declining to have something unnecessarily made he is very publicly declaring that the commitment he showed to sustainability as Prince of Wales will continue when he is king.The then-Prince Charles is depicted in a 1980 portrait by Bryan Organ, which features in the NPG book Charles III: The Making of a King (Credit: National Portrait Gallery, London)The Coronation will not be the first time King Charles III has very publicly indicated the type of monarch he intends to be via his clothing choices. In Bryan Organ's , painted at the time of his engagement to Lady Diana Spencer, the then Prince of Wales is dressed in his polo clothes and sits with his legs crossed in a relatively relaxed pose. \"The idea of informality and being relaxed was quite deliberate. He was probably thinking this is the image he wants to project, it's not the typical image of an heir to the throne, but something showing him more as an independent person in his own right with his own interests,\" says Alison Smith, chief curator of the National Portrait Gallery, which has just published  to tie in with the Coronation. \u00a0\u00a0As an unusually well-educated King with an interest in history and the history of art, King Charles will no doubt be well aware how the clothing choices of his predecessors have been used to interpret their personalities and priorities as kings, and will know that his own choices have, and will, come under equal scrutiny.Henry VIII in his finery, portrayed in the iconic portrait by the workshop of Hans Holbein the Younger, sends a message of power (Credit: Alamy)It was Henry VIII who first realised the potential of fashion as a political tool. His father, Henry VII, had won the throne by defeating Richard III at the Battle of Bosworth, the culmination of the bitter Wars of the Roses, and as such Henry VIII was \"still very keen to stress the legitimacy of the Tudor's right to rule. If you're at the top you need to assert that visually, and he marked out particular textiles as being exclusively royal,\" historian Maria Hayward, an expert on Tudor and Stuart fashion, tells BBC Culture. These were cloth of gold, the colour purple and sable fur, although they would have been reserved for special occasions. \u00a0An added impetus was the break with Rome, following his divorce from Anne Boleyn, which left England in the religious minority. Dressed in his finery in the iconic portrait by Hans Holbein the Younger, destroyed by fire in 1698 but still widely known due to the multiple copies made and disseminated at the time, Henry VIII was determined to send out the message that he was a powerful king, entirely the equal to his European contemporaries.By the time of Charles I, \"there was a move away from cloth of gold except for very, very formal occasions,\" says Hayward. \"Satin is now the favoured fabric, invariably in those lovely pastel colours we associate with the Van Dyck portraits.\" However, this less ostentatious style certainly did not coincide with a more democratic approach to rule. And we all know how that ended up.George I, depicted here by Wilhelm Lafontaine, was a low-profile King (Credit: Royal Collection Trust / His Majesty King Charles III 2023)Following his father's execution, the future Charles II was forced into exile for many years. After the Restoration he was determined to stress the continuity of monarchy. In the coronation portrait by John Michael Wright, \"he is wearing his parliament robes over the silver tissue suit, which is the Order of the Garter suit, and that is intrinsically backward looking, almost as if the Commonwealth didn't happen,\" says Hayward. During his time in exile awarding the Order of the Garter had been Charles's only means of securing bonds of loyalty and he swiftly restored the honour after his return.\u00a0In private however, Charles II preferred a more low-key form of dress. \"He liked a degree of informality, and I think in part that must have come from is time in exile. It was helpful to be incognito. If people recognised him, and didn't acclaim him, it would have been a bit embarrassing. But it also suited his personality. He preferred to do business in an informal, private setting,\" says Hayward.When it comes to the Hanoverians, their contrasting, conflicting personalities are most certainly evidenced in their dress sense.George I \"was not interested in fashion at all,\" says Anna Reynolds, curator of , currently showing at the Queen's Gallery, Buckingham Palace. A portrait by Georg Wilhelm Lafontaine sees him looking decidedly un-regal in a plain wool coat.\u00a0 However, as he was an elderly German man who didn't speak much English, was only 52nd in line to the throne, and only king because he was the nearest Protestant candidate according to the Act of Settlement, it probably suited him to keep a low profile.George III devised the Windsor Uniform, worn by the King along with other Royals (Credit: Royal Collection Trust /His Majesty King Charles III 2023)\"He left all the pageantry and splendour to his son, the Prince of Wales, the future George II, who ran a sort of rival court at Leicester House,\" says Reynolds. Always richly dressed he was nicknamed \"dapper George,\" by one courtier.In addition to fashion, he was \"also almost obsessionally interested in uniforms, insignia and protocols of rank. He always wore the Order of the Garter for example,\" says Reynolds. The last monarch to lead his troops into battle, and proud of his image as a soldier king, George II was also responsible for introducing uniforms for the army and navy.The pendulum swung back once again with George III who, it was said, dressed so unassumingly he could mingle in the crowd without being noticed. Although Reynolds thinks that might be something of an exaggeration, she does think the stories are a part of this characterisation of him as a very down-to-earth king who in the prints of the time was depicted as Farmer George.George III was \"very frugal,\" says Reynolds, and \"not really interested in his appearance at all.\" Although she notes that he did \"understand the need to dress for the role whenever necessary, so he wears the Coronation robes with great swagger in Ramsay's portrait.\"\"He was always most at ease in uniforms of office,\" she says. So much so that he devised his own Windsor Uniform, influenced by the European trend for civilian uniforms which had been introduced by Louis XIV as a means of indicating a close connection with the monarch. Consisting of a dark blue coat with red collar and cuffs and pale breeches, \"it was his favourite style of dress for the last 30 years of his life,\" says Reynolds.Initially only worn by members of the Royal Family, it was gradually adopted by senior attendants in the royal household, and by the aristocracy. \"It became a demonstration of a close relationship with the king but also a public demonstration of support for him during his difficult periods, including when he was ill. At a thanksgiving service to celebrate his return to health many were wearing the uniform,\" says Reynolds.A version is still worn by members of the Royal Family for events at Windsor, and it has influenced the uniforms of visitor services staff at Windsor and in London.George lV, portrayed here in an 1821 portrait by Sir Thomas Lawrence, was an enthusiastic follower of fashion (Credit: Alamy)In marked contrast to his father, the future George IV was an enthusiastic follower of fashion who for a while had the famed English dandy, Beau Brummell, as his style guru. \"In portraits he's very much as the forefront of fashion,\" says Reynolds. He favoured well-cut quality fabrics, a style which became particularly associated with England and which, for the first time, actually influenced what was worn in France.His keen interest in fashion extended to the Tudor and Stuart inspired outfit he designed for his coronation, the most extravagant in British history. It included a coronation mantle made of red velvet, lined with ermine, and ornately embroidered which was so enormously heavy it took eight train bearers to carry it. Unfortunately for George IV he had to wear it during a heatwave in July. \"The whole ensemble almost caused him to faint and apparently he used 19 handkerchiefs during the homage alone,\" says Reynolds.Equally renowned for his flamboyant style was Edward VIII. He loved colour and pattern and wasn't afraid to make a bold statement, combining clashing patterns with great elan and wearing traditional British fabrics such as tweed in unconventional colours like cinnamon. Rejecting the buttoned-up formality of his childhood he was famed for a casual style he labelled \"dress soft\". At the same time, no one could wear a suit quite like him. \"I was in fact produced as a leader of fashion, with the clothiers as my showmen and the world as my audience,\" he famously proclaimed.George VI was a very different man, who of course never thought he was going to be King. After painting him in the robes of the Order of the Garter, Sir Gerald Kelly commented on the problem of \"persuading this modest man to strike a decorative pose\". \u00a0It seemed he was far more comfortable without the trappings of royalty. And perhaps his unostentatious, reassuring style was exactly what the country needed after the turmoil of the abdication and the threat of war with Germany. \u00a0George VI\u2019s personal style was reassuringly unshowy at a time of turmoil under the threat of war and following the abdication (Credit: Getty Images)King Charles combines his great uncle's love of fashion with his grandfather's commitment to duty. In the years since the Organ portrait, his style has been defined by beautifully cut, double-breasted suits and a certain way with accessories. \"It's his signature style, consistent across the years, always looking immaculately turned out,\" says Smith. In an understated, very British way, he clearly cares deeply about the way he looks. \"I mind about detail and colour and things like that,\" he told Vogue editor Edward Enninful in a 2020 .But he is also an activist royal, committed to sustainability and the protection of the environment, who has refused, sometimes controversially, to keep his views to himself. What he wears, and how he wears it, reveals his concerns in multiple ways.The humble blue cornflower can frequently be seen in his buttonhole, and it appears in a particularly  by Nadav Kander from 2013. Now endangered in its natural habitat, the flower draws attention to his environmental concerns.Clearly aware of the devastating carbon footprint of the fashion industry, Charles has taken \u00a0steps to influence the production methods of his own suppliers. He has remained loyal to certain makers for years, but around 30 years ago he began insisting that to earn his Royal Warrant they had to conform to specific environmental requirements. Although some protested, they all eventually concurred.Once items are in his wardrobe, he loathes the thought of ever throwing them away. \"I'd rather have them maintained, even patched if necessary, than to abandon them,\" he told Enninful. And he is certainly not the kind of man who feels the need to have something newly made for every special occasion. The Anderson and Sheppard Morning suit he wore for the Duke and Duchess of Sussex's wedding dates back to the mid-1980s. He has a tweed coat that he has worn in four separate decades. \u00a0And he puts his commitment to environment and sustainability into practical actions. As Prince of Wales, Charles founded the Campaign for Wool, promoting wool as an inherently natural, renewable and biodegradable fibre. At Dumfries House he started a training scheme in high-end fashion and sewing skills which developed into the , a range of luxury sustainable clothing for men and women created in partnership with Yoox Net-a-Porter and The Prince's Foundation.It remains to be seen whether as king he will have time to be so actively involved in such initiatives himself. Or if he, and his advisors, will feel it would be inappropriate to do so. However, by wearing quality clothing made in an environmentally friendly manner, preferring to have items repaired rather than discarded, and wearing the same items on repeat, King Charles will continue to be a highly visual ambassador for sustainable fashion and the environmental causes to which he has long been committed. \u00a0\u00a0"

        "text": "During her 9-to-5, Tolu Frimpong is a marketing manager based in south-east London. But in addition to her corporate role, she is a content creator and financial coach, earning income from freelance writing, brand partnerships, affiliate marketing and one-to-one financial coaching. She\u2019s on a mission to make \u00a325,000 ($31,423) each year from her side hustles \u2013 and she wants everyone to know.Through her YouTube channel, Frimpong, 35, openly shares her financial journey. She believes talking about side income could help others meet their financial goals. However, she has never publicly disclosed her corporate salary: even though she\u2019s transparent about her side-hustle earnings and \u00a336,000 debt elimination, she still believes discussing pay with full-time colleagues is taboo.\u201cIt was only maybe a few years ago I even realised that it wasn\u2019t illegal to mention how much you earned to colleagues,\u201d she says. \u201cI've always grown up just assuming that you're not allowed to discuss salaries with your colleagues \u2026 I've just never questioned it because no one ever discusses it.\u201dYet she feels entirely differently about discussing earnings around her secondary career. She says it\u2019s because she has creative freedom and control over her work, unlike in a corporate job where she has a fixed role, and must meet the company\u2019s expectations and operate within the parameters set by them.As the , especially among young workers, so has the trend of earnings transparency among some of them. It\u2019s not just Gen Z participating in this \u2013 people across different age groups now have the platforms to publicly disclose their income, and advocate for pay transparency as well. On TikTok, the hashtag \"pay transparency\" has amassed 511.1m views and \u201cside hustle income\u201d 7.6m views, respectively, as of this writing. Many of these people report disclosing their entrepreneurial incomes to inspire others to grow their own ventures, or encourage them to build long-term wealth.Yet there\u2019s a flip side \u2013 as open as these side hustlers are about their off-hours income, many still stay tight-lipped about how much they earn from their 9-to-5 jobs. What\u2019s driving the difference \u2013 and will it change?Tolu Frimpong, 35, is hoping to make a \u00a325,000 ($31,423) from her side-hustles this year, and shares her journey online (Credit: Courtesy of Tolu Frimpong)In Spain, remote-worker Sira Masetti, 34, a quality auditor at Amazon, maintains an online side hustle publishing websites about niche topics such as self-improvement and relationships. She started the venture as a hobby in the pandemic, and saw the potential of turning it into a lucrative income stream. She posts on Twitter about how she grows her websites and makes money from them through ad revenues, which average to \u00a33,500 ($4,365) per month.\u201cSide-hustles release the \u2018inner entrepreneur\u2019 in individuals \u2013 so talking about their earnings is one way to demonstrate their success,\u201d says Jennifer Nahrgang, a professor of management and entrepreneurship at the University of Iowa, US. \u201cIn short, individuals are proud of what they are accomplishing. Individuals view side hustles as new opportunities that they can share with others to entice others to join them in their success.\u201dMasetti\u2019s intention with being open about her side income is to inspire other people to build long-term wealth. \u201cI think that having a side hustle and then transforming it in a business, if it works, is probably the best and easiest way to make money and build wealth in the long term. So, I started to share insights about my side hustle journey, because I genuinely want people to see that they can achieve financial freedom, exactly as I did, and how they can do it.\u201dBut, like Frimpong, Masetti keeps her corporate salary quiet, believing it to be much lower than what people would expect from a large company like Amazon. She\u2019s worried others will assume she\u2019s worth what she earns at her corporate job, and label her unfairly, even though the job is what she needs right now. \"People may think that in more than five years I wasn't able to make more, or that I wasn't able to grow in the company.\"34-year-old Sira Masetti makes about \u00a33,500 ($4,365) per month off her side hustles (Credit: Courtesy of Sira Masetti)Another reason these creators may keep their full-time earnings close to their chests, says Nahrgang, is that colleagues at the same company may feel like they are competing for pay or that salary disclosures might create tension.This rings true for Matt Brighton, 30, a senior product manager in financial services with multiple side hustles as a content creator and property investor. Based in Sheffield, he earns what he calls a \u201chigher than UK average\u201d salary in his corporate role at Remote, an HR solutions start-up, but prefers to keep the exact amount private. He believes sharing corporate earnings could potentially expose him to rumours, or make it awkward with any of his current co-workers who might be earning less.However, Brighton is transparent about his side-hustle earnings. Last year, he made more than \u00a330,000 from those projects, and he has already earned more than that in the first quarter of this year. \u201cLet\u2019s say I share my side income this year and it\u2019s more than someone at Remote makes on their full-time salary. I\u2019d still feel fine because it\u2019s my outside business that has nothing to do with the workplace. They can only look at it with inspiration because that\u2019s not something they can control.\u201dLast year, Matt Brighton, 30, made more than \u00a330,000 from side-hustle projects (Credit: Courtesy of Matt Brighton)While discussions of pay in the corporate world has long-standing rules and unspoken practises that tend to protect the employers, experts say the emergence of side hustles \u2013 and the transparency around them \u2013 has the potential to shake up norms around pay transparency.Gabriela Serpa Royo, an analyst at Canvas8, a global behavioural insights practice, explains, \u201cFor many, the act of publicising side hustles feels a bit like speaking into a void. There\u2019s no boss, or colleague to measure yourself up to.\u201d She adds, \u201cThe creator economy is fairly new, which is why it\u2019s fertile playing ground for new work rules. Through side hustles, people are playing with taboos to reinvent norms for a more transparent, inclusive workforce.\u201dAdditionally, says Serpa Royo, there\u2019s no guidance set by HR or clear career paths laid out in the world of side hustles; instead, people have to turn to each other for information about the steps they take and how much they make, which is often encouraged on social media.It remains to be seen whether sharing side-hustle earnings will trickle down into more transparency around full-time pay. However, experts including Rameez Kaleem, founder and director of 3R strategy, a London-based independent HR consultancy, say they\u2019ve seen a push for increased pay transparency among young workers. Even if the progress is slow, this evolving attitude, combined with movements such as side-hustle income sharing, could pave the path for a new era of salary disclosure."

        "text": "Gardens are, more often than not, a tranquil place of refuge. However, they have always revealed much about the attitudes and priorities of the culture in which they were created.\u00a0 at Germany's Vitra Design Museum showcases a number of unique spaces that take a much broader approach to what they can be. Whether promoting biodiversity, making innovative use of precious green space to feed and nurture a community, or drawing inspiration from popular culture to create a private fantasy world, they reveal that gardens have the potential to nurture, educate and entertain, all the while dazzling us with the sheer wonder of nature.- - - The Gardens of Marqueyssac in France symbolise an era of elitism, but are now open for all to enjoy (Credit: Romaine Laprade)The picturesque gardens of the Chateau de Marqueyssac in V\u00e9zac are a classic example of the western formal garden, the style of which was perfected in France having initially been inspired by the Paradise gardens of Persia. In the 1860s the then owner of the chateau, Julien de Cerval, began planting thousands of boxwood trees which he had carved into elaborate, rounded shapes. The trees are complemented by over 6km of pathways, belvederes, rockeries and waterfalls. \u00a0\u00a0Although undoubtedly stunning, for many this type of garden was a symbol of aristocracy, and therefore disliked. Rich men owned gardens such as these; poor men worked in them. The gardens fell into disrepair in the second half of the century, but a new owner restored them and opened them to the public in 1997. They are now listed as a National Historical Monument.S\u00edtio Roberto Burle Marx in Rio de Janeiro is now preserved as a Unesco World Heritage site (Credit: Getty Images)Roberto Burle Marx was one of the great landscape artists of the 20th Century. He is responsible for modernising Brazilian garden design but also made a major contribution to the protection of the rainforest with his research into native flora.Despite being born and raised in Brazil, Burle Marx's first encounter with plants from the Amazon rainforest was at the Botanical Gardens in Dahlem, during a year and a half he spent in Berlin in the late 1920s. Frequently referring to the experience as an \"awakening\", he realised that the European-influenced gardens back home were virtually devoid of native species. He made it his mission to correct this anomaly, becoming an ardent defender of biodiversity in the process.In 1949, he and his brother bought S\u00edtio Santo Ant\u00f4nio da Bica, a farm on the outskirts of Rio de Janeiro, which would become a testing ground for his botanical and artistic research. \u00a0\"He was really interested in primary research about the plants, and understanding what environment they would need to thrive, which plant went with which and how to propagate them and how to turn them into these amazing garden artworks,\" says Viviane Stappmanns, co-author of the book that accompanies the exhibition.At S\u00edtio Santo, he was able to explore the colour combinations, shapes, textures, contrasts and perspectives that could be created with native plants before integrating them into his designs. During his lifetime, he and his team collected and cultivated more than 3,500 plants, many of which he discovered himself. So important was his work that S\u00edtio Roberto Burle Marx is now preserved as a Unesco World Heritage site.Prospect Cottage Garden at Dungeness, Kent was nurtured in harsh, windy conditions by filmmaker Derek Jarman (Credit: Howard Sooley, 1993)In 1986, the artist and filmmaker Derek Jarman was touring Southern England filming footage for an experimental film that would be titled The Garden. Stopping off at Dungeness in Kent, together with his partner Keith Collins and the actress Tilda Swinton, he came across Prospect Cottage, a small fisherman's hut that happened to be up for sale. Despite it being in the shadow of a nuclear power station and subjected to a hostile climate all year-round, Jarman was besotted. He bought the property and moved in, but tragically in December of the same year he was diagnosed with HIV.Jarman's desire to create a garden following the diagnosis, and on such unpromising land, has come to be seen as a determination to create life in the face of death. \u00a0It seemed impossible at first. Jarman's attempts to grow roses in the barren, stony soil failed miserably. But then he began to look for local species that had learned to endure the coastal winds and lack of rain. He found that plants such as seakale, gorse and poppies thrived there. These \u2013 together with lavender cotton, foxglove, thistle, lathyrus and flax \u2013 are what he grew among the shingle that surrounds the cottage, helped, it has to be acknowledged, by layers of compost buried beneath the surface. Pieces of driftwood and rusty metal form an idiosyncratic sculptural display at the rear of the cottage, adding to the sense of the garden as artwork.After Jarman's death in 1994, the garden was cared for by Collins until his own death in 2018. A fund-raising campaign by the British Art Fund in 2020 ensured that the cottage and garden would be preserved, and it is now possible to visit by prior appointment. \u00a0Novelist and garden writer Jamaica Kincaid has created a garden in Vermont that references global horticultural history (Credit: Getty Images)The garden of Antiguan-American novelist, academic and garden writer Jamaica Kincaid is not currently open to the public, although her admirers are able to catch glimpses of its verdant lusciousness on her Instagram account. It is undeniably beautiful, but Kincaid frequently uses it as inspiration to explore the hidden ugliness of global horticultural history. A history that, it is all too easy to forget, is frequently tied up with colonialism, cultural appropriation and displacement. \u00a0\"She's addressing this thing that is slowly seeping into public consciousness. There are a lot of fashions around plants but often their cultural history can become neglected or eradicated along the way,\" says Stappmans.Kincaid is aware that many of the plants she was most familiar with growing up in Antigua were not actually native to that country, breadfruit being a prime example. Although it is now synonymous with the Caribbean, it was introduced there as it was an easy-to-grow food for enslaved workforces.She notes that the Spanish invader Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s didn't mention the dahlias, zinnias and marigolds he likely saw in Montezuma's famous Aztec garden in the 16th Century and yet, she insinuates, Spain's brutal conquest of Mexico is why we are able to enjoy them in our own gardens today.As Kincaid forces us to acknowledge, our ability to appreciate the beauty of the flora and fauna around us is often reliant on ugly events of the past.Liao Garden, Yangjiang, is among the gardens featured in the exhibition Garden Futures (Credit: Courtesy of Zheng Guogu and Vitamin Creative Space)Popular culture and gardening are not something we would usually think to put together. Yet it was the hugely popular computer game Age of Empires that provided the initial inspiration for Zheng Guogu's Liao Garden in his hometown of Yangjiang. \u00a0For Guogu, an artist whose work explores the impact of digital technology and western culture on Chinese tradition and contemporary life, the garden seemed like a logical extension of his artistic practice. He began constructing the garden in 2005, basing it on the game in which players occupy land in order to create their own new worlds. Guogu dug canals, built houses, planted trees and even constructed mountains.Over time the garden has evolved to include a Museum of the Wind, a series of open layers connected by staircases which, as the name suggests, exhibits nothing but the wind, a Frangipani garden (a plant rarely seen in Chinese gardens), and a landscape feature called a  which includes more than a dozen layers, each containing a pool of water.Guogu has likened the garden to the Chinese private gardens of the past, such as the classical Suzhou gardens that encircle nature. \"You are inside and couldn\u2019t care less about the outside. One should keep the spirit of tradition and not lose the spirit of the garden,\" he says.The Kebun-Kebun Bangsar in Kuala Lumpur is a haven for the local community (Credit: Courtesy of Kebun-Kebun Bangsar]Kebun-Kebun Bangsar is a space in which the boundaries between park, allotment and community garden blur. Initiated by Kuala Lumpur-based landscape architect Ng Sek San and a group of volunteers, it makes innovative use of a seemingly unpromising space \u2013 a long strip of land under a power line. However, in a city that only has five sq m of green space per person \u2013 the WHO recommends 50 sq m \u2013 every spot is precious. Last year, the organisers  an eviction notice.Feeding underprivileged people was one of the primary objectives in starting the garden, as was teaching locals how to prepare for potential food insecurity by growing their own produce. When the pandemic happened in 2020, the situation they had been preparing for was suddenly upon them. There were shortages in the supermarkets, but the garden proved to be a plentiful source of supply.Post pandemic, the garden continues to be a haven for families and volunteers, and in addition to providing food to local residents, it also plays a key role in waste management. Food scraps from the entire neighbourhood are turned into compost.Sek San hopes the garden will be seen as a precedent, and that others will make equally innovative use of underutilised land in order to benefit their local communities.\u00a0"

In a statement issued by his lawyers on Friday, Daniel Penny expressed condolences to Mr Neely's family. His cause of death has been ruled a homicide. No charges have been filed for his death so far. The case has focused attention on crime and homelessness on public transport. \"We would first, like to express, on behalf Daniel Penny, our condolences to those close to Mr Neely,\" his lawyers said in a statement issued to US media. The statement says that Mr Neely - a 30-year-old homeless Michael Jackson impersonator, \"had a documented history of violent and erratic behaviour\" which they said was \"the apparent result of ongoing and untreated, mental illness\".The lawyers add that Mr Neely had been \"aggressively threatening\" their client and other passengers, and that Mr Penny and others \"acted to protect themselves, until help arrived\".\"Daniel never intended to harm Mr Neely and could not have foreseen his untimely death.\" The Manhattan prosecutor and police are currently deciding whether to press charges. Homicide means a death caused by another person, but is not necessarily a murder. The incident happened on Monday afternoon on the F-line train in the SoHo section of Manhattan. A video captured by a freelance journalist on the train shows the former Marine holding the 30-year-old man - who was said to have been acting erratically - around the neck for two minutes and 55 seconds. Two other passengers are also seen restraining his arms. All three later let go of the man, who is then seen lying motionless on the floor.Police told CBS News, the BBC's US partner, that Mr Penny told other passengers to call 911 during the struggle with Mr Neely. The network reports that a grand jury will probably meet next week to determine whether there is enough evidence to press charges. If charges are brought, Mr Penny will probably argue that his reaction was justified to defend himself. In order to be found guilty, prosecutors must prove that he used deadly force without believing that Mr Neely was also prepared to use deadly force, experts told the New York Times.This video can not be playedWatch: New Yorkers demand action on homelessnessProtests have been held calling for an arrest to be made in the wake of the chokehold death.

        "text": "A former columnist's civil rape trial against Donald Trump has featured tense exchanges with lawyers and controversial remarks about women's bodies. E Jean Carroll is suing the ex-US president, alleging he raped her in a Manhattan department store nearly 30 years ago. Mr Trump has consistently denied the accusation.Here are the key moments from the closely watched two-week trial in New York, which Mr Trump himself has so far not attended. One of the most pivotal moments of the trial came during Ms Carroll's opening testimony, when she described in graphic detail what she alleges happened in the Manhattan Bergdorf Goodman store in 1996 and the trauma she says she has endured as a result. \"I'm here because Donald Trump raped me and when I wrote about it, he lied and said it didn't happen,\" she said. She then proceeded to walk the court through the day of the alleged assault, explaining how she bumped into Mr Trump and exchanged flirtatious banter with him before things quickly turned violent. She said Mr Trump asked her to come with him into a dressing room, where he closed the door, held her against the wall and raped her. \"As I'm sitting here today I can still feel it,\" she told the court.She added that Mr Trump's denial of the assault had shattered her reputation, costing her her job and romantic relationships. \"I'm here to try to get my life back,\" she said. During several hours of cross-examination over two days, Ms Carroll faced challenging questions about the assault from Mr Trump's lawyer, Joe Tacopina, who attempted to cast doubt on her details of the alleged rape. During a particularly tense exchange, Mr Tacopina repeatedly asked Ms Carroll why she did not yell when the alleged assault occurred. \"I'm not a screamer\", she told Mr Tacopina, adding that some women do not come forward about sexual assaults because they are asked why they did not scream. \"I'm telling you he raped me whether I screamed or not,\" she told Mr Tacopina at one point. The veteran Trump lawyer also pressed Ms Carroll on why she did not report the assault at first to the police. The former Elle magazine columnist replied that she was a member of the \"silent generation\", saying women her age were taught to keep quiet. Mr Tacopina also questioned Ms Carroll on why she could not recall the specific date of the assault. The writer later conceded that certain parts of her story were \"difficult to conceive of\".This video can not be playedWatch: Trump confuses his ex-wife with E Jean CarrollDuring the trial, Mr Trump did not mount his own defence at all, calling no witnesses and appearing to defend himself only in a video of his deposition, excerpts of which Ms Carroll's lawyer played for the court. Facing questions from Ms Carroll's lawyer Roberta Kaplan, Mr Trump continued to deny the allegations he raped Ms Carroll, calling them a \"big fat hoax\" and repeating previous remarks that Ms Carroll was \"not his type in any way\". But at one point, he appeared to confuse Ms Carroll for his ex-wife Marla Maples, a mistake Ms Carroll's lawyers claimed undermined his argument that the writer was not his type. In the video, Mr Trump is shown an old black-and-white photo of him speaking to a man and two women at an event. \"It's Marla,\" he said, before his own lawyer told him the woman he referenced in the photo was indeed Ms Carroll. In another excerpt from Mr Trump's video deposition played for the court, Ms Kaplan replayed for Mr Trump a controversial Access Hollywood recording from 2005 featuring a conversation between him and the show's co-host about women.  \"When you're a star, they let you do it. You can do anything,\" Mr Trump said in the recording, which was leaked to the public just one month before the 2016 presidential election. \"Grab them by the [expletive]. You can do anything,\" he added. Asked about the clip by Ms Kaplan, the former president seemed to double down on the remarks, claiming: \"Historically, that's true with stars\". When Ms Kaplan pressed him on his comments about grabbing women \"by the [expletive]\", Mr Trump said: \"Well, I guess if you look over the last million years, that's been largely true - not always true, but largely true, unfortunately or fortunately.\"In other tense moments during the questioning, Mr Trump appeared to grow agitated with Ms Kaplan, attacking her appearance, claiming that, like Ms Carroll, \"you wouldn't be a choice of mine either, to be honest\". This video can not be playedWatch: Trump agrees \"stars can do anything to women\" in video depositionDuring her second day on the stand under questioning from her own lawyers, Ms Carroll described the backlash she encountered after coming forward with her rape allegation. After Mr Trump released a statement in social media denying the accusation and calling Ms Carroll's first lawsuit against him a \"con job\", Ms Carroll said she faced a \"wave of slime\".She said many extrapolated on Mr Trump's remarks that she was \"not his type\", telling her she was \"too ugly to go on living\". Mr Trump's social media comments also sparked a rebuke from the judge in the case, Lewis Kaplan. The former president has called the suit a \"made-up scam\" and claimed Ms Carroll's lawyer was a political operative, remarks Mr Kaplan called \"entirely inappropriate\".

        "text": "By now, most of you will have seen the dramatic images that came out of Russia this week.An object can be seen flying towards the dome of the Kremlin Senate building. There is an explosion. Black smoke billows from the scene.Cue another explosion: of rumours and speculation about what happened.A drone attack? Apparently. But by whom? Ukraine? Russian partisans? Or was it an inside job? A false flag operation?Cards on the table: I don't know. Much remains unclear about what happened but here are my thoughts:The official version of events - the Kremlin version - is that this was a Ukrainian drone attack (two drones, in fact) targeting President Vladimir Putin himself.An ? Seems unlikely. President Putin does have a private apartment in the Kremlin but his main residence is 32km (20 miles) away.Even Russian state TV appeared to cast doubt on that version on Wednesday evening. One analyst on Channel 1's Vremya evening news bulletin observed: \"The kind of explosive charge carried by drones like these cannot do widespread damage. This attack was clearly just for show.\" President Putin.\"We don't attack Putin or Moscow,\" said President Volodymr Zelensky this week. \"We fight on our territory. We're defending our villages and cities. We don't have enough weapons for this.\"This video can not be playedWATCH: Russian video circulates after Kremlin attack claimsBut suppose this was, indeed, an operation conceived and carried out by Ukraine, or by a group in Russia sympathetic to Kyiv? Even if this was \"just for show\"?That would be hugely embarrassing for the Kremlin. Just imagine: the seat of Russian power, one of the most heavily guarded complexes in the world, penetrated by a couple of drones packed with explosives - despite all the air defence systems protecting Moscow and the jamming systems the Kremlin surely has to keep dangerous drones at a distance and to prevent such attacks.Improbable, impossible even? Well, think back to 1987 when West German teenager Mathias Rust evaded Soviet air defences and . History shows that nothing is impossible.It was telling how the main evening news bulletins on Russian TV channels reported this week's incident. It was the top story. But neither of the bulletins I watched, Vremya on Channel 1 and Vesti on Russia-1, broadcast those dramatics videos of explosions and smoke. Instead, they used library footage of the Kremlin and Red Square. Perhaps because the image of a defenceless Kremlin under attack was too uncomfortable to share. Russian newspapers covered the story the following day, however, not in great detail.But back to rumours and speculation. Social media is awash with cries of \"fake!\" and \"false flag!\" Some commentators suspect it was staged by the Russian authorities or by elements of the security services to provide a pretext for escalating the war in Ukraine. And yet, ever since the Kremlin launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, it has shown it is ready to escalate the conflict without a need for any pretext. Why would it stage-manage such a potentially embarrassing incident that many will interpret as a sign of the Kremlin's weakness? And think back to those TV news bulletins: they avoided showing images of the explosions. There are other theories. Could what happened be the result of infighting in the corridors of power here, between different groups vying for influence over the Kremlin?As I said in my disclaimer, I do not have the definitive answer. Just lots of questions.

        "name": "New York failed Jordan Neely, homeless advocates say",
        "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-65504985",
        "text": "Days after a subway passenger killed a homeless man on the New York City subway, there was little sign of what had happened in the underground station where the fatal confrontation ended.Only a scribble of graffiti in black ink, reading \"Rest in power, Jordan Neely\" gives any indication of what had transpired on Monday. But above ground, his story is sparking a heated conversation around homelessness and the city's ability to protect its most vulnerable residents.The 30-year-old's personal story suggests a series of failures in the system for dealing with homeless people in New York City, advocates say.They cite a lack of mental health support and housing resources, and a dearth of professionals deployed to provide direct, experienced aid to people in distress.New York state senator Jabari Brisport, a Democrat, believes \"there are people all across the income spectrum who are in need of\" mental health services.\"Those who can afford it get it, but those who cannot afford it end up the victims of violent individuals who decide to respond to an interaction on the subway with a chokehold,\" he said.Homelessness is one of the city's most intractable issues. Nearly 69,000 people were homeless in New York City as of December 2022, according to the Coalition for the Homeless.That is despite the city's Department of Homeless Services having a budget of $2.2bn (\u00a31.74bn) this fiscal year alone.New York City has resources to help people experiencing homelessness, including a housing voucher system, a right-to-shelter law, and multiple non-profits geared at helping people find housing, jobs, and treatment. The city has also launched a pilot mental health response force, B-HEARD, and in March the mayor announced a sweeping mental health agenda. Yet every day, tens of thousands of people struggle to obtain lodging, food, and social services. Many of them, like Mr Neely, end up seeking shelter or aid on the subway as a last-resort refuge that can sometimes lead to uncomfortable encounters with commuters.This video can not be playedWatch: New Yorkers demand action on homelessnessOn 1 May, Mr Neely was killed on a northbound F train by another passenger, who put him in a chokehold during an altercation.A video taken by bystander and journalist, Juan Alberto Vazquez, begins as the confrontation is already under way. The full sequence of events is unclear and police continue to investigate.Mr Vazquez, told several outlets that, before the incident began, Mr Neely was shouting about being hungry and thirsty. Police sources also told CBS News that Mr Neely was allegedly acting erratically and throwing trash.At some point, a fight began between Mr Neely and another passenger. A video shared by Mr Vazquez shows the passenger, a 24-year-old US Marine Corps veteran called Daniel Penny, putting Mr Neely in a chokehold. The two struggled on the floor and other passengers also attempt to restrain Mr Neely. Mr Neely slowly stops moving, and was later pronounced dead at a hospital.The New York City medical examiner ruled Mr Neely's death a homicide that resulted from \"compression of [the] neck\". The 24-year-old passenger was questioned by police and has not been charged.\"Daniel never intended to harm Mr Neely and could not have foreseen his untimely death,\" the statement said.The Manhattan district attorney's office has pledged a \"rigorous ongoing investigation,\" a spokesman said in a statement. CBS News reported that prosecutors may convene a grand jury on the matter.Mr Neely was a subway performer who impersonated Michael Jackson. Social media videos circulated after his death show him performing the pop star's signature moves with a beaming smile. But his life was also marked by immense tragedy and encounters with police.Mr Neely's mother, Christie Neely, was murdered by her boyfriend in 2007. Her murderer was sentenced to 30 years in prison in 2012, . Mr Neely began experiencing mental health issues after her death, his aunt, Carolyn Neely, \"He has never been the same,\" she said. \"It had a big impact on him. He developed depression and it grew and became more serious.\" She told the newspaper that Mr Neely had serious mental health conditions and it is believed he was homeless at the time he died.He had also had dozens of encounters with the police, including 42 arrests on charges such as evading fares, theft, and unprovoked assaults on three women, Advocates for the homeless saw many missed opportunities to get Mr Neely treatment and support.The Coalition for the Homeless condemned New York's leaders for their \"complete failure to provide the critical mental health services desperately needed by so many people in our city\".Adolfo Abreu, the housing campaigns director at Vocal New York, said that Mr Neely would have faced multiple obstacles to receiving mental healthcare, housing, and food, many of them caused by policies - or lack thereof - to deal with homelessness.\"We've advanced policies that are built towards erasing, criminalizing, and institutionalising homelessness, instead of compassion,\" he said. A lack of affordable housing has charged New York's homeless crisis and shows no signs of abating. The average monthly rent for a one-bedroom apartment rocketed to $3,795 in April, according to Zumper. Mr Neely's story has also revealed a divide between New York's Democratic leaders and voices further to the left, progressives, who call for different approaches to homelessness and public safety. New York City mayor Eric Adams, and New York Governor Kathy Hochul, have sought to address rising crime on the subways and a general atmosphere of rider mistrust by drastically increasing the presence of police. They announced a Subway Safety Plan in February 2022 and a surge in police presence.Part of their plan included more mental health professionals and resources to help homeless people sheltering in the subway. But the most visible result of their plans has thus far been an increased number of police in the subway system.Ms Hochul said in February that the strategy of \"cops, cameras, and care will crack down on subway crime, help those experiencing homelessness get the support they need to get out of the system, and alleviate concerns of riders to ensure New Yorkers feel safer throughout the subway system\".Mr Adams said that it was \"cruel and inhumane to allow unhoused people to live on the subway, and unfair to paying passengers and transit workers who deserve a clean, orderly, and safe environment\".Progressives and advocates for the homeless, however, believe that linking homelessness to crime only further stigmatises a vulnerable population. They have called for a surge in social workers trained to help the homeless, rather than police, as the solution.Of Mr Neely's death, Mr Brisport, the state senator, said that \"we have the money to pay a cop, or cops, to arrest him repeatedly, but not the money that can make sure he eats, shows extremely misplaced priorities\".While the debate over the appropriate approach to homelessness in the city continues, on one point most New Yorkers could agree: the system failed Mr Neely.\"Jordan deserves justice,\" his aunt, Carolyn Neely, said in a statement to the BBC. \"He was loved.\"Ex-Marine defends NYC subway chokeholdNew York subway chokehold death sparks protests"

        "name": "Why The Wicker Man has divided opinion for 50 years",
        "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-south-scotland-65470238",
        "text": "Like all the best cult films, The Wicker Man has been dividing audiences from the moment it slipped into Britain's cinemas 50 years ago.The story of a Christian police officer sent to a remote Scottish island community to investigate the disappearance of a local girl has been described as \"the Citizen Kane of horror movies\" - and derided as one of the 10 worst films ever made.The project started off well. It was written by Anthony Shaffer, hot off the hit play and film Sleuth, and its big horror star Christopher Lee said it was one of the finest screenplays he had ever read. But things started to go wrong when it went into production. The budget was too low, its island setting had to be recreated on the mainland in Galloway, and a story centred on the importance of spring and pagan May festivals had to be shot in October.A further row over editing and a lacklustre release as a B-movie alongside Don't Look Now in 1973 almost smothered the film before it was born.\"In contemporary terms, that would be like a Steven Spielberg film going straight to video, virtually unthinkable,\" wrote Edward Woodward, who played the police officer, in the foreword to Allan Brown's book Inside The Wicker Man.But just as the film deals with the rebirth of nature every spring, The Wicker Man did not die.It was reborn in small second-run cinemas, on TV, on video and DVD, and over the years its reputation grew.Academics and a growing fan base pored over its themes and strange quirks. After all, how many films deal with paganism, Christianity, murder and rural isolation with a cast including Scottish comedy greats, screen horror icons, two international sex symbols - plus songs and dances?  Christopher Lee, despite his star status, made the film for nothing and championed it for his entire life.\"It's one of the most remarkable films ever made,\" he said in a 1998 BBC documentary.\"It's not only amusing, it's romantic, erotic, very disturbing and very frightening.\"A \"premiere\" of the film took place in Newton Stewart in January 1974 as a thank you to local people who had supported the production.This week the cinema hosted another premiere: the restored 4K version of The Wicker Man, ahead of a new UK-wide release for the film.The director Robin Hardy, who died in 2016, had a complicated private life. He had five wives and eight children, two of whom spoke at last weekend's showing.Justin Hardy, now a filmmaker himself, and his half-brother Dominic said it had taken them a long time to see the film objectively.\"I was nine at the time and I only ever saw that film as a bad pagan omen,\" said Justin. \"That was when I lost my father and my home.\"\"I was distanced from it for a long time,\" added Dominic, a university professor who grew up in Canada. \"It felt like a real gut punch.\"But the anniversary of The Wicker Man has brought them closer together and they are now making a film about their father's filmmaking legacy. Despite decades of inspiring other films, documentaries, books and theses, material about their dad and the making of the film is still coming to light. \"A lady phoned us up to tell us she had six sacks of letters,\" said Justin.\"She said: 'Should I burn them?'\"The letters have been saved from the flames, unlike The Wicker Man of the film. And to celebrate the anniversary, as well as the traditional pagan May Day festival, a new Wicker Man was burned this week.Created by artist Amanda Sunderland, it stood 15ft (5m) tall - a quarter of the one featured in the film - and met its end on the same site at Burrowhead, near Isle of Whithorn.\"My dad and two uncles were all extras in the film so I've always had a fascination,\" she said.\"We always asked to see the film when we were younger, and then more and more people were coming to the area asking about the film and no-one seemed to want to talk to them about it. So I thought: 'I can do that'.\"Her father Ian Sunderland, who appears masked and dancing as an \"antler man\" in the film, has fond memories of making the film.He and his brothers answered an advert and were surprised to be cast as masked villagers who took part in a procession behind Lord Summerisle as the film reaches its fiery climax.\"They brought a choreographer in on the first day and he wanted us to do dance steps in the procession,\" he recalled.\"If you look at us, you'll realise we were never going to be dancers so he had us sway to the music instead.\"Lesley Mackie was just out of drama college when she was cast in the film as Daisy Pringle.\"I had three lines and I was definitely the oldest 'child' in that cast,\" she said.\"Then we went to the pub, and they discovered I could sing and that's why I ended up recording two songs in the film - The Highland Widow's Lament and Willow's Song. That's the one which Britt does her sexy dance to.\"In 1973, Britt Ekland was an international sex symbol, and her naked dance in The Wicker Man may have contributed to its appeal.But the scene gives us one of the film's most enduring controversies because it's not just Britt up there on the screen.A body double was used and several women claim to have been contracted - but whose bottom made the final cut? It's still being debated.Despite working on her Scottish accent with Lesley Mackie, Britt Ekland's speaking voice was dubbed by the Scottish actress and singer Annie Ross and the use of all these doubles may explain why she later claimed never to have seen the film.For fans of the film, all this just adds to its appeal.Irish IT specialist Fergal O'Riordan launched a crowdfunding appeal to make a documentary around the 50th anniversary.In the spirit of the original, he's calling on friends, family and the local community to support production.\"There are so many layers to this movie,\" he said.\"There's a certain creativity to chaos and this movie had so much chaos. It wasn't fully organised, it wasn't fully budgeted, it just happened and I hope I can reflect that in my own slightly chaotic little movie.\"He encouraged fans to come to the area for the anniversary, in costume, and a number answered the call.Gavin and Lisa Eagleton-Muir spent their first wedding anniversary touring locations from the film.Five years later, they're back in Dumfries and Galloway to meet other Wicker fans and celebrate the 50th anniversary of the film.\"It's unlike anything else you'll ever see,\" said Gavin.\"It's horror, but it isn't. It's a musical, but it isn't. It's an anomaly of a film but that's what makes it special.\"Wicker Man director Robin Hardy diesThe life of Sir Christopher Lee"

        "name": "Their plane went down - how this WW2 Canada crew survived",
        "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-65410429",
        "text": "On 1 May, 1943 a plane carrying a mostly Canadian crew went down in the Netherlands. Eighty years on, the BBC is retelling the events of that fateful day - and their far reaching consequences - , which features British veterans telling their own stories for future generations.For as long as Janet Reilley can remember, the first day of May has been one of remembrance for her family - of lives lost and saved in combat.Her father \"Mac\" Reilley would pick up the phone to his friend \"Buddy\" MacCallum, to remember the events of 1943 that shaped their young lives - and their futures. Few of \"the greatest generation\" who fought during World War Two remain to bear witness. Now, it's up to their descendants to keep their memory alive, so that others might understand the bravery, sacrifice and trauma of one of the 20th Century's defining conflicts.This particular story, of the crew of a Handley Page Halifax heavy bomber, is about how a small group of young Canadians flew in the skies over Europe during the Battle of the Ruhr. That plane was just one of more than 8,000 aircraft lost in action during Allied bombing operations.Using their own recollections and those of their families, as well as records from the Bomber Command Museum of Canada, the BBC is retelling the story of how their plane went down, the drama of their capture and how some of them survived. The core of the crew - \"Andy\" Hardy, MacCallum and Reilley - first flew together in July 1942. By the spring of 1943, they were joined by tail gunner \"Red\" O'Neill, flight engineer Ken Collopy, and upper gunner, Norm Weiler, one of only two non-Canadians.The other was my great uncle, Flight Lieutenant Herbert Philipson Atkinson, otherwise known as \"Phil the Englishman\". MacCallum, the wireless operator, believed they were lucky to have one of the best pilots in the Royal Canadian Air Force.So high was the rate of loss in their squadron that they were considered both an \"old\" and \"lucky\" crew. The odds were against them - only about 15% of RCAF crews flying on the same type of aircraft survived a full tour in 1943, At 14:00 on 30 April 1943, alongside five other crews, they received a two-hour briefing of their operation for that night - Essen, described to them as one of the toughest targets in the Ruhr. Home to the Krupp steelworks, the city was vital to German military manufacturing.Delayed due to fog over England, they set out at midnight. Shortly after 03:00, Atkinson gave the order to open the bomb doors over the \"huge furnace, with thousands of searchlights and heavy flak guns blasting away\" in the defence of Essen.Suddenly Hardy, who was navigating, cried out, \"I've been hit.\" An anti-aircraft shell had severed his right leg above the knee.MacCallum tried in vain to save him, wrapping him in his bomber jacket to keep him warm and giving him morphine in his agonising final moments. With their navigator dead, Atkinson told Reilley to release their bombs and then help him guide the aircraft clear of the target. Hardy's careful log and map table were unreadable with his blood, so Reilley plotted a course home to England from the flight plan and astral navigation. \"Fighter starboard!\" shouted someone as the sound of cannon shells hitting the fuselage rang out. \"Everywhere you looked was fire,\" recalled Weiler.\"The skipper dived and then pulled up, and the flames did die down a little, but flared up and spread over the wing as we dived to hold flying speed,\" recalled MacCallum. Atkinson's decision to dive stopped the aircraft from stalling and rolling over, giving his crew the chance to follow his instruction to bail out.Reilley and O'Neill had bailed out before, the only survivors of a crash in October 1942. That event is traced in the Canadian landscape at Mount Hudema in British Columbia, which Reilley had named in honour of the pilot. It is one of more than 950 locations in the territory with a name connected to World War Two. The last to leave the plane was Callopy, with Atkinson remaining to fly it so his crew could safely bail out. He did not survive. But six members of the crew did - landing in fields and trees around Elst in the Netherlands, where they were captured as prisoners of war (POWs).Years later, Weiler recalled how after landing in a field of cows, he had heard the bombers in the air returning home, and had felt \"a sickly and lonely feeling\" as he contemplated what fate awaited him.They were swiftly separated and sent to camps across Nazi-controlled territory. Collopy and O'Neill to Northern Germany, MacCallum to occupied Lithuania, and Reilley, Nurse and Weiler to occupied Poland.As an officer, Reilley went to Stalag Luft 3, where an elaborate escape attempt would go on to inspire the Hollywood film \"The Great Escape\".That film dramatises the efforts to dig three tunnels from the prisoners' living quarters to the woods beyond the perimeter fence. In real life, the plan was to let 200 RAF officers to escape through Germany using forged documents and civilian clothing, all created within the camp. Only 76 officers made it out of the tunnel, and only three managed to not get caught. The Gestapo executed 50 in retribution. This video can not be playedJim Glennie was an 18-year-old soldier when he faced the terrifying reality of the D-Day landingsReilley, who was number 86 in line to escape, never made it into the tunnel he had helped build. Originally, he did not even know he was signing up for the escape plan - he thought he was joining a prison cricket league. \"It was my task to haul sand brought up from the tunnels to wherever it was being dispersed; as well I did a bit of security when my knee was really bad,\" Reilley would recall, having injured his knee and ankle when he landed in some trees after bailing out of the Halifax.That knee would cause him more trouble, when he was forced to march, along with other Allied prisoners, through bitter winter conditions towards the end of the war. The Nazis wanted to use them as a human shield to limit the final onslaught of bombing raids on major cities.They survived four months trekking aimlessly for  hundreds of miles on foot, faced with the ever-present risk of death by starvation, exhaustion, exposure or summary execution. MacCallum, a Nova Scotian, maintained he had never experienced such a \"bone-chilling\" cold. He narrowly avoided being killed by his own side when their bedraggled column was mistaken for a German unit by Allied aircraft. The scars on his heels from marching without socks would last a lifetime.Only Collopy and O'Neill would be spared from marching.Two years and a day after the crash, Reilley was liberated by the Cheshire Regiment near Lubeck, northern Germany, having lost 55lb (25kg) since the start of the war.MacCallum was freed on the banks of the River Elbe, while Weiler was liberated near Munich.The six who returned were all still in their 20s, young men who had left Canada to serve.For MacCallum, making it home meant he would get to marry Rosemary. They had met before the war and had an understanding that if he came back alive, they would wed. They did so on 14 July 1945.Their entire courtship had been conducted by handwritten letters over the course of the war. \"It blows my mind that somehow letters got between Grafton and Poland or Lithuania,\" says their eldest son Wayne. They were expected to find jobs and carry on with life. So MacCallum, who'd gone to war at 18 straight from school, trained as an electrician and built a home for himself and his new family.With help from his father-in-law to get work initially, Buddy and Rose would build a life in her home town of Grafton. She still lives there, not far from Wayne.Collopy returned to work the family wheat farm on the edge of Frobisher, a village of 150 people in Saskatchewan.Those who made it back alive would raise families, knowing that 17,000 men who volunteered for the RCAF would never get that opportunity.They carried with them not just physical but emotional injuries from their experiences.Wayne would only discover that his father had endured nightmares for the rest of his life after his death in 2021. During his lifetime, his dad \"kept it to himself, except when he talked to Mac\".Janet, Reilley's daughter, remembers how her dad gave up alcohol when she was three, having used it to cope with the continued memories of surviving the crash, imprisonment and the forced march. He was hospitalised twice in a psychiatric unit when his trauma became unbearable in the 1950s.\"Sometimes in the middle of the night when sleep will not come but vivid memories do I wonder if it was all worth it. And yet I have to be honest and say that in spite of it all I am glad that I saw fit to volunteer,\" Reilley said.Today Janet Reilley, is hoping that she can keep alive the family bond forged in war with Wayne MacCallum. It has lasted 80 years so far, along with the abiding memories of what \"the greatest generation\" gave and lost for peace.Australia finds wreck of Japanese WW2 disaster shipMuseum gathers together 'unsung' WW2 fighter planesRoyal Marines recreate WW2 mission 80 years on"

        "text": "Bournemouth v Chelsea (15:00 BST)For this week's Premier League predictions, Chris Sutton faces Carnival Row star and Everton fan Andrew Gower.: 1-1Tuesday's defeat at Arsenal made it 'six of the worst' for Chelsea boss Frank Lampard, who has lost all of his games since being appointed caretaker manager.The players have to take some responsibility but nothing has gone right for Lampard. He felt his side were better in the second half at Emirates Stadium, but the game was over by then - and now Chelsea just want the season to end.Things won't get any easier for them against Bournemouth, who are a well-organised team containing several individuals who have really enhanced their reputation over the past few months.For example, Dominic Solanke got 29 goals in the Championship last season and now he has shown he has got all the attributes he needs to thrive in the Premier League too. He always had decent pace but he leads the line so well now, holding the ball up and linking up with others - he has been first class.So, I don't think Lampard will get his first win, but I can see him picking up a point. That prediction is based more on the level and experience of the players Chelsea have got, rather than their recent performances. They surely cannot lose seven in a row... or can they?: Bournemouth have to be favourites here. What a job Gary O'Neil has done. 2-1Bournemouth v Chelsea (15:00 BST)Mark MitchenerBBC SportAfter a 4-0 hammering by where they were under scrutiny at both ends of the field, Bournemouth can draw breath after edging by a single goal and thumping at home to leave them anticipating another season in the Premier League.While the champagne corks may not be popping until the Cherries are mathematically safe, survival could be rubber-stamped as early as this weekend as Chelsea visit Vitality Stadium with boss Frank Lampard looking to avoid a seventh successive defeat.There have been heroes all over the pitch, but one player that epitomises the resurgence which has brought five wins from seven games during April, is the unheralded Ryan Christie.Signed from Celtic in the summer of 2021, the Scotland international was a regular in last season\u2019s Championship promotion campaign but, while he has been named in every matchday squad this season, he was substituted in all but one of his first 10 starts and only started three league games between the end of October and the beginning of April.However, Christie has now started the last six games and, despite the busy schedule, he has completed the 90 minutes in three \u2013 with his energetic displays from his attacking midfield role absolutely crucial to getting his side over the line.Boss Gary O\u2019Neil told BBC Radio Solent after the Leeds game: \u201cI was convinced I\u2019d have to take Ryan off today - I was thinking, \u2018There\u2019s no way he\u2019s doing that again for 90 minutes\u2019, but every time I looked at him, I thought, \u2018I can\u2019t take you off!\u2019\u201dReports in Scotland suggest that if Bournemouth stay up, Celtic are due another bonus payment as part of the deal struck to bring Christie south \u2013 but the Cherries will consider it money well spent.Bournemouth v Chelsea (15:00 BST)Bournemouth manager Gary O'Neil has heaped praise on midfielder James Tavernier and striker Dominic Solanke after the pair were nominated for Premier League Goal of the Month and Player of the Month respectively.The Englishman himself has been nominated for Manager of the Month after overseeing five wins from seven games in April that have helped give the Cherries a nine-point cushion above the relegation zone.\u201cI was more pleased for Tav and Dom really,\" said O'Neil.\"I think Dom\u2019s put in so much work this year, and some of it has been fairly thankless.\u201cEarlier in the season, he was working his socks off and wasn\u2019t getting too much reward. I was aware of the good work but maybe from outside, people wouldn\u2019t have been as much.\u201cSo, for Dom to get some recognition for the work he\u2019s put in over the whole season, but for it to come to light in April, is fantastic.\u201dTavernier's stunning strike in the against has been nominated for Goal of the Month and O'Neil believes it is just reward for his recent contributions.\u201cI\u2019m delighted for Tav because his impact on the points tally has been huge for a guy that\u2019s moved up to the Premier League for the first time,\" he said.\u201cHe\u2019s still very young and had a real tough season injury-wise, too, but that goal against Fulham was huge, it was a massive goal.\u201cFor Tav and Dom to both be recognised and be up for awards this month is a credit to them and shows the direction the club has moved in recently.\u201dBournemouth v Chelsea (15:00 BST)Bournemouth v Chelsea (15:00 BST)If you'd told Chelsea fans at the start of 2022-23 that with five games of their season remaining they would be facing Bournemouth at home to try and stop the Cherries overtaking them in the table, they would likely have laughed in your face.Yet here we are.The Blues remain without a win since Frank Lampard succeeded Graham Potter as manager in an interim capacity. They've lost the last six in all competitions.Another defeat today and they could drop as low as 14th in the table. They're still not mathematically safe from relegation (although that is highly unlikely to happen). All this despite spending around \u00a3600m in recent transfer windows.It would be fair to say things have not gone to plan.Man City v Leeds (15:00 BST)Phil McNultyBBC Sport chief football writerTo say this completes a shift in style and emphasis is an extreme understatement, but desperate clubs take desperate measures and Leeds are very desperate as they career towards the Championship after a spell which included shipping 11 goals in two home games to Crystal Palace and Liverpool culminated in an embarrassing 4-1 defeat at Bournemouth.Javi Gracia won only three of his 11 league games in charge and Sam Allardyce's appointment, with Leeds only outside the relegation places on goal difference, is one final throw of the dice to maintain their top-flight status.Quite how Leeds fans take the leap from Marcelo Bielsa's glorious 'football as entertainment' philosophy, an idealistic but sometimes flawed approach they accepted warts and all, to Allardyce's style based on defensive organisation and fiercely drilled discipline remains to be seen.The brutal truth, for Leeds and their fans, is that beggars cannot be choosers and even if they dislike the taste of the medicine Allardyce will deliver, they will accept it gratefully if it cures their relegation ills.For Allardyce, it represented an undoubtedly lucrative 'win-win'.Keep Leeds up and he will be hailed as a miracle-working hero.If Leeds go down, he will not be blamed after inheriting a team seemingly in terminal decline with only four games to save them.Man City v Leeds (15:00 BST)Chris BevanBBC Sport at Etihad StadiumThe first target for Big Sam today is to do better than when Leeds were last here,\nin December 2021, and lost  Marcelo Bielsa was their manager that day and\nthey were  down after 32 minutes.He also needs to do improve on the last time he faced City himself, as West\nBrom boss in January 2021. The Baggies were beaten  at The Hawthorns, and\nwere  down at half-time.Allardyce was on the wrong end of the same  scoreline the last time he came to\nEtihad Stadium, with Crystal Palace in May 2017 and he has picked up only  in his past  here... but he did get lucky in September 2005, when\nCity hit the woodwork a record five times, but still lost to Gary Speed\u2019s stoppage-time\npenalty for Bolton.Big Sam was smiling that day, will it be the same today?Tottenham v Crystal Palace (15:00 BST)Ryan Mason, unsurprisingly, is not interested in the speculation surrounding who the new permanent Tottenham manager will be.Spanish football expert Guillem Balague told  this week that Brighton boss Roberto De Zerbi has been approached by Spurs, but Mason would not be drawn on the rumours.\"Naturally, when there is uncertainty, there are going to be names [mentioned]. That is part of football. But none of my energy or attention is going into outside noise or speculation,\" he said.\"Within these walls we are together, we are working together and we have got a common goal, which is trying to get as many results as possible until the end of the season.\"I am sure in the summer things will happen, but at the moment that is pretty irrelevant.\"Tottenham v Crystal Palace (15:00 BST)Things continue to go perfectly to plan for Roy Hodgson and Crystal Palace.Their exciting 4-3 win over at the weekend moved them to 40 points and all but secured them a club record 11th consecutive season in the Premier League.That means the Eagles can start planning for the long term, but the main question will be whether Roy Hodgson decides to continue.Palace have been in excellent form since Hodgson\u2019s return and won four of his six games in charge - and the one defeat came when he made a number of changes to the side in a three-game week.If things carry on in this manner, it will be hard to see him not being involved in some way at Selhurst Park.The 75-year-old was asked in his news conference before the match at Selhurst Park if he would be at the club past the end of the season, and he said: \"I refuse on this occasion to make comments on what will happen with me at the end of May.\"That is hardly surprising. As he acknowledges himself, he has been caught out by his past comments and returned to the game twice when it looked unlikely - first with Watford last season and now with Crystal Palace for a second stint.Hodgson loves being around football and Palace are special to him as he went to watch them as a boy on the terraces.In their current form, Palace could pick up a number of significant points before the end of the season - and that may make the decision for Hodgson to walk away even harder.Man City v Leeds (15:00 BST)For this week's Premier League predictions, Chris Sutton faces Carnival Row star and Everton fan Andrew Gower.: 3-0So, new Leeds manager Sam Allardyce says he is up there with any manager in the Premier League, along with Manchester City's Pep Guardiola.I guess we will find out on Saturday if Sam is right.City found it harder than I expected to break down West Ham on Wednesday, but eventually found a way through.I really can't see the Leeds defence putting up the same kind of resistance, and this might be a game where City wrap the result up early before taking their foot off the gas.: Even with Big Sam in the Leeds dugout, I think City are going to have a big win. From Everton's point of view, I hope I'm right. 4-1Man City v Leeds (15:00 BST)Sam Allardyce is preparing for the \"biggest challenge\" of his career to keep Leeds in the Premier League.\"It's probably my biggest challenge because of the shortness of games that are left and the difficulty of those fixtures,\" he said on his unveiling as Leeds coach, joking, \"We start with an easy one on Saturday. It can't get any easier than away, can it?\"It's one the players have to take on, that I have to take on, and we'll go to Manchester City and do our best to get a result.\"It has been done, did it. Shocks happen - whether one happens on Saturday, who knows? If we are to stay in the Premier League, we need to stop conceding goals so easily.\"Allardyce, who returns to top-flight management for the first time since experiencing relegation with West Bromwich Albion in 2021, took training with his new side for the first time on Wednesday and was impressed by what he saw.\"Collectively, they seem quite good together,\" added Allardyce. \"I've seen a positive attitude and I would have expected them to be more miserable than what they seem.\"My first impression is that they're desperate to do better. With a bit of support and guidance, and breeding a bit of confidence into them, hopefully they can build themselves up and give more.\"Man City v Leeds (15:00 BST)Since guiding Bolton Wanderers to the Premier League in 2001, Sam Allardyce has enjoyed a long and impressive career in the top flight.Here are the numbers behind the man tasked with keeping Leeds in the division with four games remaining.Man City v Leeds (15:00 BST)Former midfielder Michael Brown examines the effect Sam Allardyce can have on his Leeds United players as they prepare for his first game in charge at Manchester City on Saturday...Wolves v Aston Villa (15:00 BST)That is the problem with a long unbeaten run - it stings all the more when it finally ends. And there was no denying on Sunday that Villa had been outplayed by a side which has clearly improved under Erik ten Hag.Such has been the transformation of Villa, that Sunday\u2019s first half came as something of a cold shower. Even the best teams do not play well every time though, and there is clearly still a good deal more growing to do to reach the ambitions of the club and the coach.But all is not lost in the race for Europe, even if their rivals are formidable. have regained momentum, and showed they have got over the FA Cup semi-final by dismantling . And then there\u2019s .As luck would have it, those four clubs happen to be the teams left on Villa\u2019s fixture list. Wolves are up first and, although strong defensively at Molineux recently, last weekend they looked like a team who could not wait for the season to end. The other three games give Villa the bonus chance to take points away from their direct rivals for European qualification.Wolves v Aston Villa (15:00 BST)Aston Villa have been flying under Unai Emery but their 10-game unbeaten run, featuring eight victories, came to an end at Manchester United last weekend.They remain well in contention for a European place however as they begin the day just a point behind sixth-placed Brighton.Reflecting on the defeat at Old Trafford, Emery said: \u201cMy ambition and obsession is to improve and to analyse each match with the players. It\u2019s another match to use to improve and to analyse.\u201d\u201cWe knew that this was the most difficult step. Of course, Brighton won [v Manchester United on Thursday], Liverpool are winning a lot of matches.\u201cWe are going to fight against Brighton, against Tottenham, against Brentford. I like to play a lot of matches, if we are in more competitions, it is better.\u201dMan City v Leeds (15:00 BST)Manchester City: \u201cWe are coming from a lot of games. We needed fresh minds and legs to go for it. It is important to have everyone ready, including Kevin [de Bruyne]. The way [Rico Lewis] played since arriving in the team was massive. He played at Leeds; of course the shape Jesse Marsch used could be different to today.\u201cWe need a lot of rhythm, we believe he can bring that. We know Sam Allardyce is a competitor and he is a master at set pieces. When you play against teams battling for survival in the Premier League it is always so difficult. After the Fulham game I said every game will be similar. How we perform will be the difference. It is how we approach it; after this game there are only four left.\u201d#bbcfootball, via WhatsApp on 03301 231826 or text 81111 (UK only, standard message rates apply)Big Sam's defensive masterclass coming up at the Etihad.Man City v Leeds (15:00 BST)Leeds United fan and comedian Micky Kerr says is \"the right call\" but believes his task to keep the club in the Premier League \"is a big ask\".The Whites are 17th in the table, only above on goal difference, with four games remaining.Speaking to BBC Radio 5 Live, Kerr said: \"We have gone from having Marcelo Bielsa to Sam Allardyce. It is like going from Michelangelo to graffiti. It is a big fall from grace but, in all fairness, we have to have a change for the run-in.\"It is just about putting out this last fire. This is the last roll of the dice A new manager is the right call, but we will see how it goes.\"We\u2019ve got Manchester City next, so there are three games left really. Newcastle at home - you never know. There is Southampton, who are down. Forest look like they are going to get another four points - maybe even six. Everton look like they are doing well.\"I feel like we need two wins minimum and we have got West Ham away and Tottenham at home on the last day of the season. I reckon he has to win those two. It is a big ask.\"If we have a sniff on the last day of the season you never know - and we got out of it last season and beat Burnley to 36 points.\"Man City v Leeds (15:00 BST)Pep Guardiola sent a chill down the spine of Premier League defenders when he claimed Erling Haaland's staggering goalscoring feats might be beaten - by Erling Haaland.The Norwegian has set a new 35-goal Premier League record, eclipsing Alan Shearer and Andy Cole, and is now on 51 for the season, 12 short of Dixie Dean's all-time English record for all competitions.Few would argue against Haaland matching it. And if he does, Guardiola thinks he will beat it.\"This record will be broken sooner or later,\" he said. \"Maybe by him in the future because he will score a lot of goals.\"We are very pleased for him. He is a joy. Everyone is happy to have him with us.\"Tottenham v Crystal Palace (15:00 BST)Tottenham HotspurTottenham interim manager Ryan Mason says his players are \"playing for their careers\" in the remaining four games of the season.First, on his side's approach against Crystal Palace today, Mason told Premier League Productions: \"It's to try and win the game and to be the team that scores first, that's the goal. We want to be on the front foot.\"They're in a very good moment. They have changed manager and responded well. \"They are a dangerous team but we are confident we can hurt them too.\"While a top-four finish is likely now out of reach, Spurs, in seventh, know a top-six finish would at least guarantee Europa League football next season.\"There's loads at stake,\" Mason said.\"The players are playing for their careers, to be here next season.\""

        "text": "The mobile phone footage is wobbly as Azza weaves her way through the crowd to the door of the Coral Hotel in Port Sudan.\"Are there any staff here from the British embassy?\" the 39-year-old mother of three asks the man at the door. He holds the door open just enough to hear the question - but not enough to let her in. \"Those people packed up and left yesterday,\" he replies.All around Azza, people are crowded on the steps of the hotel.It is where the UN has its headquarters, and the British Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO) recently set up a temporary consular office to help British nationals trying to flee Sudan. Many sit on chairs in the shade of the building's portico, seeking relief from the sun, clutching mobile phones and folders full of documents. They all want to get out of the country while they can.It's Thursday morning and Azza and the children have been there since the previous day. They are desperate.But the last British flight has left and the British consular presence seems to have disappeared.A few hours later, the FCDO travel advice page for Sudan, which had pointed would-be evacuees to the hotel since flights from Khartoum ended earlier in the week, abruptly changes. It now reads: \"Due to the changing security environment in Port Sudan, we do not have a presence at the Coral Hotel.\"For Azza, a British citizen, a door has been slammed shut. Azza writes an anguished statement: \"I want to express my frustration and disappointment with the British government's handling of the recent evacuation efforts in Sudan.\"I was told that my children would be allowed to travel with me out of this war-torn country to the safety of Britain.\"Her statement describes an 11-hour journey from Shendi, north of Khartoum, with warplanes flying overhead, and the disappointment of being rejected at the Coral Hotel. \"To our shock and dismay, we were told we could not travel,\" she writes, adding: \"The British government's advice had been misleading, and we were left stranded in a dangerous situation with no clear guidance or support.\"Her husband Ahmed Abuelgasim, who is back in Khartoum, spoke to me from his car in al-Manshiya, a neighbourhood east of Khartoum International Airport. The 46-year-old businessman said the fighting nearby made him too nervous to sit in the apartment.Ahmed grew up in west London. His father was an engineering director for Sudan Airways at Heathrow Airport.After studying engineering at Kingston University, the family returned to Sudan. Ahmed's three older brothers left in 1989, when Sudan's democratically-elected government was overthrown by Omar al-Bashir. While they settled in the UK, Ahmed stayed in Khartoum and never bothered to get a British passport. Azza was born in 1983, in Dorchester, where her father worked as a psychiatrist. As a child born in the UK to parents with indefinite leave to remain, she was automatically a British citizen.Azza and Ahmed tried to get their children British passports last year - but the process was complex and costly so they gave up, intending to try again another time. They were not planning to move to the UK but, with Sudan's troubled recent history, thought it would be wise to have options.\"Lots of people have UK passports, but don't want to live there,\" Ahmed explained, adding: \"It's a safe haven to go.\"Then suddenly it was too late. With fighting raging around them, they decided Azza and the kids should leave. By now, the UK airlift from Wadi Saedna was drawing to a close. When they contacted the FCDO hotline, they were advised to make their way to Port Sudan, about 805km (500 miles) away.They explained the children were not UK citizens and had no UK visas - and that Azza's passport was locked in a safe at the bank where she works as a financial analyst. The fighting meant it was too dangerous to retrieve it.Ahmed says the official they spoke to said it would not be a problem - Azzas's details were in the system and the FCDO's crisis travel advice suggested that children under 18 might qualify.He found a car willing to drive his family through the night, paying $2,000 (\u00a31,582) for a journey that would normally cost $50 each by bus. But when they reached Port Sudan, their hopes were shattered. Arriving at the Coral Hotel on Wednesday, ahead of a 10:00 (08:00 GMT) deadline for British nationals to register, Azza was told she could board a flight - but the children could not.\"If I hadn't received the invitation, believe me, I wouldn't have sent my kids out in the middle of the night,\" Ahmed said.It seems the couple missed a bit of different advice which appeared on the constantly changing Sudan page of the FCDO website earlier in the week.Evacuation was open to children under 18, it stated, \"who are either non-visa nationals or those with existing UK entry clearance\".Deputy Prime Minister Oliver Dowden said last month that border force staff were \"empowered to exercise discretion\" when it came to dependents. At the Coral Hotel, Azza was told that, had she arrived with toddlers, there would have been no problem.The speed of events in Sudan over the past three weeks has been almost impossible to keep up with. Evacuation plans have had to be developed from scratch, travel advice revised again and again.But on Friday afternoon, thanks to the intervention of the former British Ambassador to Sudan, Irfan Siddiq, Azza and the children boarded a Spanish ship bound for Jeddah, where a flight will take them on to Cyprus and the UK.It is a bittersweet moment for Ahmed. His family will soon be reunited with relatives in the UK - but he has no idea when he will see them next.\"I really don't want to be thinking about that now,\" he tells me. \"I just want them to be safe.\"BBC reporter: My heartbreaking decision to leave SudanBaby meets father for first time after Sudan escapeFinal UK evacuation flights leave SudanWhat is going on in Sudan?

Milliner Jess Collett has made hats and hairbands for Catherine's sister, Pippa Middleton, in the past.Thought to be Collett's first collaboration with McQueen, the three-dimensional leaf embroidery of this piece is duplicated in a smaller version, worn by Princess Charlotte.Dr Benjamin Wild, a cultural historian and expert on royal dress, says it is significant that none of the Royal Family are wearing tiaras. \"Dispensing with the coronets is a nod to make the monarchy more relevant and more modern,\" he says. \"Only the King and the Queen will have jewel-encrusted crowns on their head, to elevate their status.\"The Queen's coronation dress is by British fashion designer Bruce Oldfield, who has been designing for her for more than a decade, providing couture for many of her public engagements.\"This is the biggest commission of my life - I have to pinch myself sometimes,\" says Bruce Oldfield, who worked closely with the queen on this gown, and who is a guest at today's ceremony. \"Her Majesty has always been wonderful to collaborate with. I know what she feels happy and confident wearing.\"The tailored gown has an ivory, silver and gold colour palette, with bracelet-length sleeves, a wide neckline and a short train.Cut from Peau de Soie, a matte silk fabric, and woven in Suffolk by Stephen Walters, the dress features embroidery depicting garlands of wildflowers, said to represent the King and the Queen's affection for nature and the British countryside. There is also celebratory bunting stitched in antique gold and silver thread.The front hem of the underskirt and the dress's cuffs are embellished with the floral motifs of the four nations - which were also elements of Queen Elizabeth II's sparkling coronation dress in 1953, by couturier Sir Norman Hartnell.Camilla is also wearing the Coronation necklace and earrings made for Queen Victoria by Garrard in 1858. Worn by several Queen consorts in history, as well as at the last coronation by Queen Elizabeth II, the platinum, gold and silver set necklace comprises 25 stones, removed from old garter badges as well as the hilt of a ceremonial sword.\"It is very fitting that she is wearing it today,\" says Joanna Hardy. \"It's wonderful to see all these jewels being worn - so much nicer than seeing them in a glass cabinet.\"All photographs are subject to copyrightBest pictures of the King's coronation so farWho's who at the Coronation?"

They create fast-spreading fires that are very difficult to put out. Russia has been accused of using them before.Russia has been trying to capture Bakhmut for months, despite its questionable strategic value. Western officials have estimated that thousands of Moscow's troops have died in the assault.Writing on Twitter, Ukraine's defence ministry said the attack had targeted \"unoccupied areas of Bakhmut with incendiary ammunition\".It is unclear when it took place. But the footage shared by Ukraine - seemingly captured by a surveillance drone - showed high-rise buildings engulfed in flames.Other videos posted to social media showed fires raging on the ground and white clouds illuminating the night sky. A BBC analysis of the video posted by the defence ministry located the footage to an area just west of Bakhmut city centre and close to a children's hospital. While the analysis confirmed the attack used some kind of incendiary munitions, it could not verify the use of phosphorus.Russia has been accused of using white phosphorus in Ukraine, including during  at the beginning of the war. Moscow has never publicly admitted to using the substance, and last year Kremlin Press Secretary Dmitry Peskov insisted \"Russia has never violated international conventions\" after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said it had been used.  White phosphorus is a wax-like substance that burns at 800C and ignites on contact with oxygen, creating bright plumes of smoke.Human Rights Watch (HRW) has warned the chemical is \"notorious for the severity of the injuries it causes\". It is extremely sticky and hard to remove, and can re-ignite when bandages are removed. Russia has signed the  which bans the use of incendiary weapons - which are designed to catch fire - in civilian areas.But HRW says white phosphorus does not fall under the treaty as its primary purpose is to \"create a smokescreen to hide military operations\".The chemical has been used \"repeatedly over the past 15 years\", including by US forces against IS fighters in Iraq and Syria, according to HRW. Some analysts say its use as an incendiary weapon near civilians would still be illegal. While Bakhmut had a pre-war population of 80,000, there are practically no civilians left in the area.The attack comes a day after the commander of Russia's Wagner paramilitary group said he would pull his forces out of Bakhmut on 10 May in a row over ammunition supplies. Yevgeny Prigozhin said Wagner's casualties were \"growing in geometrical progression every day\", and blamed the defence ministry for his decision to withdraw.On Saturday, Prigozhin said Ramzan Kadyrov - the leader of Russia's semi-autonomous Chechnya region - had agreed to take over Wagner positions in the city and replace their fighters with his own.\"I am already contacting his representatives in order to start transferring positions immediately, so that at 00:00 on 10 May,\" Prigozhin's press service quoted him as saying. Despite his claims, Ukrainian officials said Wagner was redeploying mercenaries towards Bakhmut in a bid to capture the city before Tuesday's Victory Day celebrations in Russia.\"We are now seeing them pulling [fighters] from the entire offensive line where the Wagner fighters were, they are pulling [them] to the Bakhmut direction,\" Deputy Defence Minister Hanna Maliar said.The fighting comes amid reports that Ukraine is preparing a large-scale counteroffensive. Prigozhin himself has said he believes the attack could come as soon as 15 May. An offensive could take place in the Zaporizhzhia region which is about 80% controlled by Russia. On Friday, the Russian-installed governor of Zaporizhzhia ordered the evacuation of villages near the front line.Russia considers the area as its own territory, following self-styled referendums and an Reported chemical attack deeply concerning - USHow will we know if Russia has used chemical weapons?Mariupol: 'We have wounded and dead inside the bunkers'"

He did not appear on the Buckingham Palace balcony with the King, Queen and other members of the Royal Family.The prince reportedly plans to return to the US to celebrate his son's birthday.His uncle Prince Andrew left Westminster Abbey in a car behind, with Princess Eugenie and her husband.Earlier, when Prince Harry entered the abbey, dressed in a morning suit and wearing medals, he appeared relaxed and was seen smiling at guests as he walked down the nave of the abbey, before chatting to several family members. He tapped Princess Beatrice's husband Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi on the back with a smile on his face, before taking his place beside Jack Brooksbank - husband of Princess Eugenie - in the third row. Also in the third row was the Duke of York, Prince Andrew. He watched the ceremony behind the King's sister Princess Anne and the Duke of Kent, Queen Elizabeth II's first cousin, dressed in Garter robes on the second row.Ahead of them were the Prince and Princess of Wales and their children Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis, as well as the King's brother the new Duke Edinburgh - Prince Edward - and his wife Sophie.   Previously, Prince Harry had been seated in the second row - directly behind the King - at Westminster Abbey for the late Queen Elizabeth's funeral last year. The prince was seen in television footage watching intently as the archbishop raised St Edward's Crown above his father's head during the Coronation. Later, when the congregation paid homage to the new monarch, Prince Harry was seen along with other royals saying the words: \"God save King Charles. Long live King Charles.

Relations between Prince Harry and other members of the family have been strained since his memoir was published.The book vividly revealed fall-outs and disagreements with relatives, and he has since spoken of feeling \"different\" from the rest of his family.The decision for Meghan to reject the invitation was widely seen as part of these continuing, unresolved family tensions.And last month it was revealed that the King tried to stop Prince Harry taking legal action against newspapers over alleged phone-hacking.

That theme was reflected in the oaths and prayers King Charles made, and the sermon delivered by the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby.\"I come not to be served, but to serve,\" the King said in his first prayer after reaching the abbey. \"We are here to crown a King, and we crown a King to serve,\" the Archbishop began his sermon with.This video can not be playedWatch: Katy Perry searches for her seat at CoronationIn the abbey, Charles was proclaimed as the \"undoubted King\" in the first stage of the ceremony.The congregation was then asked to show their homage and service, shouting \"God Save the King\".Yet among the music and oaths, there were moments of complete silence as each stage of the ancient ceremony finished.In the most sacred part of the service, the King was shielded from public view by anointing screens while choristers sang Handel's Zadok the Priest - performed at every coronation since 1727. Prince William also made a pledge of loyalty to King Charles, before members of the congregation were invited to offer their own support.Despite the very English weather, there was a celebratory atmosphere on The Mall on Saturday morning, with periodic Mexican waves and police officers being cheered.Among the spectators was Alexandra Hornyak, 57, from Montreal, Canada.\"I've known for years that I would want to attend this day, and the day that it was announced, I was driving to the office, and my husband just called me and said 'May 6',\" she told the BBC.\"I knew exactly what it was.

Here's a look at who was there - and who got the front row seats.Members of the Royal Family were front and centre at the ceremony, many in full regalia, like the Prince and Princess of Wales. They were joined by their children Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis, sitting on the front row of Westminster Abbey.Their eldest child Prince George is one of the King's pages of honour and walked behind his grandfather as he entered the abbey, helping with his robes.The Duke of Sussex attended, sitting alongside his cousins Princess Beatrice and Princess Eugenie. His wife Meghan is staying at their California home with their children Lilibet and Archie - who turns four today.Representing the US was First Lady Jill Biden, accompanied by granddaughter Finnegan - the pair were wearing complementary blue and yellow outfits, the colours of the Ukrainian flag.Their compatriots at the service included singer Katy Perry, who will be performing at the Coronation concert on Sunday. Wearing a lilac skirt suit and an eye-catching flying saucer-style hat, she was accompanied by British Vogue editor-in-chief Edward Enninful as she walked to Westminster Abbey. Also performing at the concert will be Lionel Richie, who said hello to Mayor of London Sadiq Khan as people took their seats in the Abbey. Richie was invited because of his links to the Prince's Trust charity, set up by the King in 1976. Presenters Ant and Dec were also there in their role as goodwill ambassadors for the charity, which supports young people.They were seen posing for a selfie inside the Abbey. Dame Joanna Lumley, a friend of the King and Queen Camilla, was also happy to strike a pose for a photograph as she waited to enter the building.And fellow actress Dame Emma Thompson looked excited by the occasion - or maybe it was the distinctly British weather (rain, and lots of it) that was causing her expression. Queen Camilla's children, Laura Lopes and Tom Parker Bowles, were at the service with their children. Their father, Camilla's ex-husband Andrew Parker Bowles, was also among the guests.The Middleton family - Catherine's parents Carole and Michael, and her siblings James and Pippa - sat a few rows behind the Prince and Princess of Wales. Conservative MP Penny Mordaunt took a prominent role, in her position as Lord President of the Privy Council - she presented the jewelled sword of offering to the King.The sword, made for George IV's coronation, was exchanged for a bag of 100 newly-minted 50p coins bearing the King's profile, as part of an ancient custom. Australian singer Nick Cave said beforehand that he would go to the Coronation for \"the stupefying spectacular, the awe inspiring\". Other singers attending included Joan Armatrading. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak was joined by wife Akshata Murty, with former prime ministers also in attendance - including Boris Johnson, accompanied by wife Carrie. Sir John Major, whose wife Norma was absent, was seen chatting to Sir Tony Blair and his wife Cherie.  There are seven living former UK prime ministers for the first time, and all attended the service.Dame Floella Benjamin took part in the coronation procession on Saturday. Other guests from the world of politics include Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer, pictured with Andrew Lloyd Webber, who composed a coronation anthem for the King.Foreign royals in attendance include Prince Albert and Princess Charlene of Monaco, as well as King Jigme Khesar Namgyel Wangchuck and Queen Jetsun Pema of Bhutan, whose outfits brought a pop of colour to the distinctly grey day.King Felipe VI and Queen Letizia of Spain, and King Philippe and Queen Mathilde of Belgium, were seen entering the abbey together, colour coordinated in pink.Foreign leaders present included Canadian President Justin Trudeau, with his wife Sophie, and French President Emmanuel Macron, with his wife Brigitte.All photos subject to copyright."

        "text": "Millions of people across the UK have celebrated the coronation of King Charles III - a symbolic ceremony combining a religious service and pageantry. The ceremony was held at Westminster Abbey and the King became the 40th reigning monarch to be crowned there since 1066 and followed by a huge parade.The day of splendour and formality, in which Queen Camilla has also been crowned, featured customs dating back more than 1,000 years. Here's how the day unfolded.The formal celebrations started with a procession from Buckingham Palace to Westminster Abbey at 10:20 BST.In a break from tradition, King Charles and Queen Camilla were in the Diamond Jubilee State Coach rather than the older, more uncomfortable, Gold State Coach.The procession moved along The Mall to Trafalgar Square, then down Whitehall and Parliament Street before turning into Parliament Square and Broad Sanctuary to reach the Great West Door of Westminster Abbey.Outside the palace gates, there was a Guard of Honour, comprising about 160 members of the three armed services, with another 1,000 personnel lining the route.Almost 4,000 invited guests, including armed forces veterans and NHS and social care staff, were in stands outside Buckingham Palace, with thousands more people in viewing areas along the route and official screening sites nearby.  were in Westminster Abbey, with processions there before the King arrived involving faith leaders and representatives from some Commonwealth countries who carried the flags of their country and were accompanied by the governors general and prime ministers. These included UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, who also gave a reading in the service.The King arrived at the abbey shortly before 11:00 wearing a red velvet robe of state. Underneath he was wearing trousers rather than the more traditional breeches and silk stockings worn by kings before him.The ceremony began at 11:00 and was punctuated with  with 12 newly commissioned pieces, including one by Andrew Lloyd Webber, and Greek Orthodox music in memory of the King's father, Prince Philip.The King's grandson, Prince George, was among the pages, alongside Camilla's grandchildren, Lola, Eliza, Gus, Louis and Freddy.Some of those who walked ahead of the King through the abbey carried the regalia placing on the altar until needed.The UK is, according to the Royal Family website, the only European country that still uses regalia - the symbols of royalty like the crown, orb and sceptres - in coronations.The individual objects symbolise different aspects of the service and responsibilities of the monarch.Charles was presented with the Sovereign's Orb, the Sovereign's Sceptre with Cross, and the Sovereign's Sceptre with Dove and  during the ceremony.And Camilla was presented with the Queen Consort's Rod with Dove and the Queen Consort's Sceptre with Cross - mirroring the King's sceptres.There were several stages to the service, which lasted a little under two hours, and for the first time female clergy and religious leaders from other faiths had an active part.King Charles was presented to \"the people\" - a tradition dating back to Anglo-Saxon times. Standing beside the 700-year-old Coronation Chair, the King turned to face the four sides of the abbey and be proclaimed the \"undoubted King\" before the congregation was asked to show their homage and service.Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby made the first declaration and the congregation shouted \"God Save the King!\" and trumpets sounded after each recognition.The Coronation Chair, also known as St Edward's Chair or King Edward's Chair, is believed to be the oldest piece of furniture in the UK still used for its original purpose. Charles is the 27th monarch to be crowned in it. It was originally made by order of England's King Edward I to enclose the Stone of Destiny, which had been taken from near Scone in Scotland.The stone - an ancient symbol of Scotland's monarchy - was returned to Scotland in 1996 but has been  for use in the service.During the Coronation, the oak chair is placed in the centre of the historic medieval mosaic floor known as the \"Cosmati pavement\", in front of and facing the high altar, to emphasise the religious nature of the ceremony.The Archbishop of Canterbury acknowledged the multiple faiths observed in the UK by saying the Church of England would \"seek to foster an environment in which people of all faiths may live freely\" and then administered the Coronation Oath - a legal requirement. He asked King Charles to confirm that he would uphold the law and the Church of England during his reign, and the King placed his hand on the Holy Gospel and pledged to \"perform and keep\" those promises.The King also took the Accession Declaration Oath stating that he was a \"faithful Protestant\".The King's ceremonial robe was removed and he sat in the Coronation Chair to be anointed, emphasising the spiritual status of the sovereign who is also the head of the Church of England. The archbishop poured special oil from the Ampulla - a gold flask - on to the Coronation Spoon before anointing the King in the form of a cross on his head, breast and hands.The Ampulla was made for Charles II's coronation, but its shape harks back to an earlier version and a legend that the Virgin Mary appeared to St Thomas a Becket in the 12th Century and gave him a golden eagle from which future kings of England would be anointed.The Coronation Spoon is much older, having survived Oliver Cromwell's destruction of the regalia after the English Civil War.The  in Jerusalem, and consecrated at a special ceremony at the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in the city.A screen concealed the King from view while he was anointed, because this is considered to be the most sacred part of the service.Literally the crowning moment - and the only time King Charles will wear St Edward's Crown in his life.The crown is named after a much earlier version made for the Anglo-Saxon king and saint, Edward the Confessor, and said to have been used at coronations after 1220 until Cromwell had it melted down.It was made for King Charles II, who wanted a crown similar to the one worn by Edward but even grander. King Charles III was only the seventh monarch to wear it after Charles II, James II, William III, George V, George VI and Elizabeth II - who last wore it at her own coronation in 1953.First the King was given a , and presented with items including the Sovereign's Orb, the Coronation Ring, the Sovereign's Sceptre with Cross and the Sovereign's Sceptre with Dove.Then at 12:01 the archbishop placed St Edward's Crown on the King's head and the abbey bells rang for two minutes, trumpets sounded and gun salutes were fired across the UK.A 62-round salute fired at the Tower of London, with a six-gun salvo at Horse Guards Parade. Twenty-one rounds were fired at a further 11 locations around the UK, including Edinburgh, Cardiff and Belfast, and on deployed Royal Navy ships.The final part of the ceremony saw the King take the throne. Traditionally, a succession of royals and peers would then have paid homage to the new king - but Prince William was the only person to do so this time.Instead, the archbishop invited people in the abbey, and those watching and listening at home, to pledge allegiance by saying the words: \"I swear that I will pay true allegiance to Your Majesty, and to your heirs and successors according to law. So help me God.\"After the homage, Queen Camilla was also crowned and enthroned - although she did not have to take an oath.She was crowned with Queen Mary's Crown - originally made for Queen Mary's coronation alongside George V - but it was modified to remove some of the arches and reset with the Cullinan III, IV and V diamonds.In the final part of the service the King and queen took Holy Communion - the principal act of worship of the Christian church.The King and queen then left their thrones and entered St Edward's Chapel behind the high altar - there Charles removed St Edward's Crown and put on the Imperial State Crown before joining the procession out of the abbey as the national anthem was played. The King and queen returned to Buckingham Palace along the reverse of the route by which they came, this time travelling in the 260-year-old Gold State Coach that has been used in every coronation since William IV's.The Princess Royal was among those riding behind the coach, while the Prince and Princess of Wales and their three children, princes George and Louis and Princess Charlotte, were among the royals in the three carriages and first car following. Nearly  in what the Ministry of Defence has called the largest military ceremonial operation of its kind for a generation.They were joined by representatives from 39 Commonwealth countries and the British Overseas Territories. Most marched ahead of the King along the 1.42 miles (2.29km) route and, as the front of the procession reached the palace, the back was still at Downing Street.The King and queen arrived at the palace shortly after 13:30 and received a Royal Salute and three cheers from the military personnel who had been on parade.It has become customary since the coronation of Edward VII in 1902 for the new monarch to greet the crowds in The Mall from the Buckingham Palace balcony - the Queen was joined by her mother, children and sister among other royals as she watched a fly-past involving hundreds of planes in 1953. King Charles and Queen Camilla continued the tradition and appeared shortly before 14:30 with the royals who had taken part in the procession.The day ended with a fly-past, although unsuitable weather conditions meant it was be limited to helicopters and the Red Arrows display team.Read the latest from our royal correspondent Sean Coughlan - .Your guide to the King's Coronation weekendHow popular is the monarchy under King Charles?Who is going to the coronation - and who isn't?Coronation cross will include 'crucifixion relics'Military on parade in midnight coronation rehearsalDoes King Charles need a coronation?"
